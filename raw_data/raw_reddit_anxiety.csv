1995pzb,Anxiety,2024-01-17,Shortness of breath,This Morning when I woke up from sleeping I felt shortness of breath and I was concerned about it. I have had asthma since I’ve been young but it’s never really affected me but I think this might have happened because of anxiety but I’m not to sure. On  New Year’s Eve 2023 About like 2.5 weeks ago I had my first panic attack and I’ve had many bad and good days since then I started taking  10mg Lexapro this past Friday and I do think it’s helped a bit but what I came on here to ask was is this shortness of breath from anxiety? Or should I be worried it’s something else such as a heart or lung disease? I’m asking for answers in the comments please and thank you.
1995ji4,Anxiety,2024-01-17,DAE Pass out from anxiety,"Passing out from anxiety

I’ve been diagnosed with GAD and panic disorder since I was 11years old. I’ve had the same reoccurring somatic symptoms my whole life. However, 3 years ago I went thru a very stressful time in my life where I would pass out from anxiety. I went to the er and they tested me for everything, they even gave me a heart monitor. And they came back with nothing physically wrong. It was just extreme anxiety. It stopped after the stressors went away. And I haven’t experienced them since two weeks ago. I’m going thru another very stressful time in my life rn. It gives me anxiety just thinking about it. Like I’m too anxious to drive or leave my house, because what if I pass out then? I meet with my med provider tomorrow but she wasn’t able to give me any advice last time so my hopes aren’t high. 
Anyways, I was wondering does anyone else lose consciousness when their e anxiety gets too much? I guess I just feel very alone in this. It just makes me anxious as it is and my everyday life is beginning to become more difficult for me to function in."

1995aye,Anxiety,2024-01-17,Anxiety makes me scared to lose weight: Anyone else feel like me?,"So I’m a heavier guy. 35 years old. I’ve been wanting to lose weight for about 13 years; ever since I realized I gained it. I possess all the tools necessary to do so. My cardiovascular is way better than it has any business being at my weight and I have decent self discipline. However, when I lose about 5 pounds, I feel lighter. When I feel lighter I feel like I lost too much weight too fast. And what does my irrational anxious brain attribute that to? Pancreatic Cancer or end stage renal failure! So then i get myself all worried and I go back to not exercising and eating heavy just to make sure I’m not fading away. (I never am). Now I’m fortunate enough to be self aware and I know I just have to push past it and appreciate the fruits of my labor, but I was wondering if anyone else had this kind of problem.

1994fyd,Anxiety,2024-01-17,Does anyone have a therapy/emotional support dog?,"For years I’ve been wanting a dog to help aid my anxiety. I used to have a dog and she cheered me up whenever I was down and when I was anxious we would cuddle or play. She had no training to be a support dog but I whole heartedly believe that her purpose in life was to help people take their minds off crap and to just be there. 

It’s been 3 years without a dog now and I really want another one but I’m currently living in an apartment and so I’d like to wait to have a dog again until I have a yard.

1993f2k,Anxiety,2024-01-17,Can anxiety really do this to you? Any tips on sleeping better?,"These past two weeks have been rough, I don't think I've had an OCD lapse/flareup like this in years.  

Started with getting a swollen lymph node under my chin out of nowhere with no sore throat but maybe some gum pain. This left behind a shotty lymph node. I have two others on my neck from a few years ago and so I spiraled into thinking I had lymphoma and it was spreading. I told myself I would get anxiety from this and I should just prepare for it. But it still hit hard as hell.  
After the anxiety attack, I started getting anxiety about my old OCD fears (harm, schiz, existential, etc) on top of the health anxiety. Spent a week on a business trip where I barely slept because the mattress was too hard and pillow too soft. Went to bed every night with a headache and getting all sorts of head pressure for an entire week.  

Got back, thought I could finally get some sleep in my own bed. Woke up past two nights feeling hot and still getting headaches. Mouth ulcers from last week still present. Feeling fatigued, headache all day, even a little feverish even though my temperature is normal.  
Meanwhile this whole time I'm worrying its some terminal illness that has been growing inside me for the past 5 years.  

How am I supposed to recover and normalize again if I wake up in the middle of the night with higher heart beat and feeling hot? Even though I get back to sleep, it still interrupts it. It's times like these that I worry it's not actually anxiety. Because in my head I feel calm but I'm still getting symptoms.  

Does anyone else have any tips on dealing with anxiety at night when you're fast asleep? I was thinking about just forking the cash to get a sleep regulated mattress topper and trying that out."

19937ap,Anxiety,2024-01-17,Terrified of Passing Out,"TL;DR: I almost passed out once and now every time I feel like that again I started to panic. I had a terrible panic attack last night. 

About two months ago I had my first panic attack. This was followed by two weeks of constant anxiety while I waited to see my PCP. She prescribed me 50mg Zoloft and 20 mg Hydroxyzine. I specifically asked for Zoloft because my mom, dad, and brother all take it and it works for them, and the hydroxyzine was because I had bad side effects from Xanax. 

I took my Zoloft the first night and was fine. The next I was super anxious after taking it so I took the Hydroxyzine. I felt super nauseous so I went to try and throw up but couldn't, but when I came out of the bathroom I immediately felt like I was gonna pass out. 

I had what the doctors called near syncope, and then my wife drove me to the emergency room and I had it again in the waiting room. In both instances, my heart rate dropped to 40 and my blood pressure dropped so low it wouldn't register. I was in the hospital for the next day while they monitored me and checked my heart. 

They took me off both meds until I followed up with my PCP. Naturally, I was scared to go on meds again so I was determined to beat this without them. And I felt like I was for a while. I've been following Dare and making lifestyle changes and making great progress. 

But now I keep getting terrified of passing out because of this incident, and it keeps making me panic. I'm also on a round of Prilosec right now because of ongoing stomach issues, and I think it's been making me severely dehydrated which I think is exasperating the issue. Like, I've been drinking 120+oz of water a day, plus a Gatorade zero, plus a Gatorlyte zero, and I happened to have bloodwork yesterday which showed I was dehydrated. 

This weekend I was at Dick's, just walking around, and for a second I started feeling lightheaded and started freaking out. I sat down and was able to calm down luckily. 

But last night, I was just eating dinner with my wife, not anxious at all. She asked me why my hand was red (which was because it was really dry and I had just put lotion on it). But I looked down and saw it was completely red and felt hot, and all of a sudden it was like I blacked out for a second. I didn't know what was going on. Then I started feeling like I did in my near syncope incident and started panicking. 

This was only my second full-blown panic attack, and it was much worse than the first one. For at least 30 minutes, I was shaking, nauseous, lightheaded, and I guess disassociated. It was like my brain was moving in slow motion. I kept debating going to the ER but I knew it was probably anxiety. 

I didn't feel completely better for about 3 hours. I had a very anxious time sleeping, I was very restless. Today I have a lot of tightness in my chest, and I feel very scared. Scared because this happened out of nowhere, and scared that it would happen somewhere where I'm not as comfortable, like driving or teaching (which is what I do for work). 

I just don't know how to shake this fear of passing out. It feels like it comes out of nowhere, like I'll start feeling off and then immediately start to panic that I'm gonna pass out. Luckily I start therapy next week finally, I've been trying to get in since that first panic attack 2 months ago."

1992eyp,Anxiety,2024-01-17,Getting on medication help,"I’ve dealt with horrible anxiety issues since I was 14 (23 now) When I was about 18-19 I started taking a prescription dose of Xanax, about a milligram daily no more than 2mg to combat panic attacks and general anxiety. Throughout the past 6 years it’s the only medication that’s helped me to live a normal life, I was still in high school when I started and it helped me bring my grades up, helped with motivation drastically, I was able to develop a great social life and be myself and to this day It’s been a god send. It still helps me with social anxiety, motivation and panic attacks, but I was never officially prescribed by a doctor. I really want to get a prescription but I know the stigma with Xanax and abuse and I really don’t want doctors thinking I’m a drug addict trying to get abuse them. I don’t know how to approach the doctor on this issue, I want to be completely honest with them but the times I’ve tried they seem like they’re just concerned about getting me off of it. Xanax has been a miracle cure for my daily anxiety and when I started taking it was when I truly felt like myself for the first time. I want to have my own prescription so I don’t have to rely on obtaining illicitly from friends and families scripts. I would just really like some advice on how to approach a doctor with this. Basically it’s the only medication after being on numerous ssri’s and other non benzo anxiety meds that’s ever truly helped me, but I have pretty much self prescribed it. Any advice on how to get this through to a doctor would be greatly appreciated."
1992dvd,Anxiety,2024-01-17,Really need advice,"So I have struggled with GAD, social anxiety, and depression for the last few years. It started to get really bad over these last few months and I knew I needed to take another step to get better. I have been going to therapy for 3 years and needed another fix. So I decided to start taking fluoxetine. I have been taking 5mg of fluoxetine for 16 days now and not noticing any improvement. I’ve been having some side effects and A LOT of physical symptoms. I am a very negative person so being that the medicine hasn’t kicked in yet I’ve been feeling discouraged. My anxiety has also heightened because I’m supposed to go on a trip this weekend with my boyfriend’s frat. I AM SO SO SCARED. I don’t think I can do it my anxiety is at an all time high and I always feel light or pass out ish. I really just need some encouragement for this trip and want to know when meds started working for you."
199259v,Anxiety,2024-01-17,Something is wrong with me but doctor keeps saying it’s just anxiety.. I can’t live like this anymore.,"
I have felt awful for the past 8 months now and I just can’t take this anymore. 

I started having concerns about blood sugar because I had some episodes where I felt hot, sweaty, shaky, weak, jelly legs, nausea, anxious, felt like I could pass out. So I started checking my blood sugar in May. For a while I didn’t have any episodes and would go days without checking my blood sugar at all. Then all of the sudden seemingly out of no where anytime I was under 90 I got this feeling in my chest. I feel like over time the feeling changed and honestly got worse. It’s so hard for me to describe the feeling as it’s nothing I’ve ever felt before. It’s like this weird tense ish feeling with a slightly burning feeling. It feels like it’s deep inside too, I really can’t describe it which doesn’t help my situation at all. I genuinely have a hard time explaining it because it’s such an odd feeling that I never ever experienced before having this issue. It doesn’t get worse/better when I breathe or cough or anything like that. The only thing that makes it stop is to eat a little sugar/carbs and wait about 20 minutes. 

This has become extremely distressing for me because it’s causing other issues. I’ve noticed that ever since I started to get this feeling I don’t feel right. I don’t feel anything, no anxiety, no happiness, I just feel nothing but this awful feeling. It has also greatly affected my appetite. If I eat like crap I get the feeling, if I eat healthy I get the feeling. It’s like I can’t win. I don’t crave anything bad, like before I would crave unhealthy food but now I crave nothing and find it hard to even have an appetite due to this feeling. There was a time where I was getting the feeling ever single hour and had to force myself to eat just to make it stop. I’m constantly thinking about how i was never like this before and how I don’t understand why this is happening to me. 

I’m constantly trying to figure out why this is happening and I just don’t understand it at all. I never had any issues like this in the past. Since I’ve had an anxiety diagnosis in the past my doctor will not take me seriously. This feels absolutely nothing like anxiety and I’ve had anxiety in like 50 different forms. Since eating something with carbs/sugar always makes the pain stop I don’t know how that would be anxiety. I would honestly rather have my anxiety than whatever this is. So many people told me that I was getting anxious over the number and to stop checking. I knew that wasn’t the case but I stopped checking anyways. Haven’t checked my blood sugar in 4 months and yet still get the exact same symptom as I did when I was checking. Because it has absolutely nothing to do with me seeing the number. 

I had labs done in August they did lipid panel, metabolic panel, A1C, CBC, TSH. All of which were normal. I am genuinely the most miserable I have ever been with this feeling. I started to exercise, lower carbs and sugar and eat in a calorie deficit but that didn’t help the feeling at all. No one around me understands how bad this is and I just want it to stop. I don’t think I can handle it much longer and I really don’t know what to do.

I’m at my wits end with this. I can’t live my life normally because of this. I feel like if anything this has caused depression not anxiety. I feel like my doctor thinks I’m just making all this up. I literally have not gone one day in the last 8 months without getting this feeling. I don’t want to deal with it anymore. If this is how I have to feel like is just not worth is anymore."
19923ok,Anxiety,2024-01-17,Strategies or tips for making potentially life-altering decision?,"Despite being a full-grown adult, I almost never make my own decision. Usually, I'll do whatever someone else tells me to do or not do anything so circumstances choose for me because I'm so paralyzed by making decisions. I also have a very bad habit of not thinking things through and then being blindsided by obvious consequences. I've been asking my T for strategies or tips on how to weigh different options and make decisions in different circumstances, but he just repeats ""you need to choose A or B and accept the consequences."" Can anyone recommend strategies they use for making big decisions that could potentially be life-altering?

Right now, I have a huge decision to make about my health. One option involves pursuing a treatment in the next few months that likely will help me greatly, but the way it is delivered has a sizeable chance to do more damage to me and leave me sicker but there is also a chance that doesn't harm me and I end up making an enormous difference in my life. The other option is to turn this treatment down for the same treatment delivered in a way that doesn't have the risk to make me worse, but I will only be able to get it in 1-2 years and there is the possibility I will not be accepted for it because I turned down the first option and then I'll never get it.

I have been stressing over this for two months, unable to figure out how to decide what to do. I laid this out to my T and his response was ""so you need to decide whether to do A or B."" I said, ""yes, but how do I decide?"" He said, ""you pick whatever seems best to you."" I said I have no idea because there's so many pros and cons and I have no strategies for making a decision so I am paralyzed. His response was ""you just pick one or other and accept the consequences."" It doesn't go beyond this. Just him repeating over and over to choose A or B and accept whatever happens when I press for more guidance or strategies to use to evaluate the situation."

I moved to a town about an hour away from my elementary school so I literally know NO ONE here. I was bullied a lot in elementary school and I’m very terrified as being perceived as weird so usually unless I’m spoken to I mind my business and don’t talk. 

I have decent social skills and although it makes me very nervous I love to talk to people, I just hate leading and just coming up and talking to random people because I don’t want to feel like a nuisance or nosy. 

I’m known for being a “nice girl” at school but yet no one has wanted to be my freind and it makes me feel like there’s something wrong with me. If I’m known for being nice and yet no one wants to be my freind there obviously must be something. There’s literally been moments in classes where I’ve been put into a group project and my classmates will just ignore me and act like I’m not there, like bodies fully turned away from me having their own little conversation. Their body language isn’t even inviting, So I take it as a sign and I keep my mouth shut. It makes me feel like I’m invisible and really bad about myself. 

Me not having friends isn’t even due to me not talking to people I constantly give people compliments if I like their outfit I’ll compliment them, if I like their nails I’ll compliment them, ect, I try and be as nice as I possibly can be to try and befriend someone but its never worked.

Because of all this I have been robbed of all my “high school experiences” because I have no one to do them with,I sit at lunch alone, I didn’t go to semi formal or any of that stuff, no school clubs (I don’t have anyone to do them with and on top of that they all suck lol), and I’m not going to prom unless I magically make a friend in the next few months. So I feel like I’ve wasted my high school years because I’ve literally done nothing but go to school do my work, come home, and repeat.

 I struggle with social anxiety pretty badly but my drive to have friends is stronger so I compliment people through the panic. maybe I’m just more awkward and off putting than I think I am?? I don’t know.

I do have one bestfreind but they live 6 hours away and have their own life so we can’t talk all the time and it’s hard for me because they’re literally my only friend and I hate being a bother."
1990yph,Anxiety,2024-01-17,Fear of being bad,"    It feels unfair 
(f 17, and just looking for someone to see and hear me)(all disorders mentioned in this are things I have been called by my family if you are struggling with these disorders you deserve to be happy and I'm sure you are a lovely person)
I'm not doing well at all thighs are so fucked up right now and I don't feel like myself and I don't think I know who that is anymore. it feels like hell there are so many things I want to say but I want to be nice I need to be nice. I feel like if I keep punishing myself for being bad I won't ever be bad but I'll believe it and if I stop I'll be a narc until I realize too late that I made mistakes and hurt people dearly. I'm so afraid of being seen as a bad person. I will label myself as a cheater, narc, or anything to tie to the situation and believe them until my therapist tells me otherwise because I don't trust anyone else because what if they lie? This summer was horrible for me. I was burnt out trying to be there for people and having to deal with my mom yelling at me constantly and being my mom. It got to the point where I was convinced I had BPD or NPD and I felt so horrible about it I went to my mom and my brother and they both agreed that I had NPD tendencies and I was selfish my brother reasons that I never said thank you and stopped getting candy for my older brother(he treated me poorly even if I got him those things) he told me to make goals for myself and my mother thinks I'm abuser to her and even though I've never laid a hand on her and try my best just to have poker face when she yells at me. I knew what I was going to get but I still wanted someone to tell me I knew what they would say but I just wanted to believe it. I went into the worst spiral of my life and genuinely believed that my prince was just going to hurt people I had such a bad pit in my stomach that I never got out of bed all while still trying to be there for someone and when I would fail because I was unwell it leads me to think I was horrible and a narc and I would throw up. Now here I am wondering if I'm going to spiral again and what is going to cause it. No one will tell me what's wrong with me and why I'm like this and most of my family thinks I'm a smart girl who just needs to get off her phone.  Thank god for my dad who always stood up for me and took me on walks when I was on the verge of god knows what and took me out driving when I was getting in my spiral. He helped so much but I'm still scared that one day one of my mistakes will be so bad that I will feel this again and I won't be able to shake it. I'm always going to feel like it was enough and I should have suffered more. What's wrong with me?"

She demotivates me, discourages me with her words, comments on my skin colour, my choices in life with respect to clothes, people etc, always tries to show she is the superior one, emotionally dominates, plays the victim card, whining all the time, showing that doing work from home corporate job at an MNC is no work just time pass. She once said I dont care whether you are alive or dead and when I tried to call her out, she played the victim card and pinned the entire shit onto me. 

Being around her aggravates my anxiety and my mental health becomes even more bad and shitty. I am just so sick and tired of her. Sometimes I feel I should just kill myself, because thats how annoyed she has made me with myself, thats how my mental health is right now, ready to give up on myself. 

I hate how she treats me and always shows how much she cares for me. When I ask when did you care, she says I give you food on time everyday. I am like right, I am grateful for that but if that is your definition of care, then I wish that on no child because care is so much more than that. Being there for someone, understanding them, supporting them, listening and talking to them! 

I was watching a reality show wherein the host said a really nice statement: Elders should be respected, but they still dont have the right to say bad things to you or break your heart with their cruel words and actions. And I FELT THAT LIKE ANYTHING!"

It’s probably no big deal at all. A client was subpoenaed to give documents in a lawsuit between two other companies.  Basically I just needed to confirm that we can push back the date in the subpoena—the “deadline” for providing documents that were requested.  99% of the time in things like this, the dates are pushed back as the lawyers know the small businesses that are not directly involved in the lawsuit (they just had some sales to a company that is involved) don’t have a team of their own attorneys to address these types of requests.  So I forgot to ask “What is this about?” and it slipped my mind after a snow day yesterday.  I’m freaking out and now it’s affecting my outlook on my day, my job, and my life.  I’m taking a small error that will likely have zero consequences and turning it into a huge issue in my head. But so long as there’s a 1% chance that I’m wrong, I’m going to worry about it nonstop.

Hi everyone,

So I have an interview next week for a entry level trainee lab tech role in a microbiology lab. It sounds like a role I can do and they don't exactly need me to have experience from the advert but I'm worrying if they ask me why I want to work there or why I've job hopped.

The real reason is social anxiety and not being sure what I wanted to do after leaving Uni where I did a psychology degree. 

I don't want to come off pathetic or that I don't have clear direction. Can anyone help me answer a question like this if it comes up?"

It’s popped up again really bad this week. 

I’ve been in a nice modern apartment since 2022, finally feel pretty settled after a long time. Last week, I got the request to renew my lease to get a lower rate for the coming year. I notified them but hadn’t resigned officially yet when one of my best friends let me know a unit was opening up in his small, 5 unit building. 

Now here’s where it gets tricky. It would’ve been $400 cheaper, but lacking amenities I consider important. Washer/dryer, AC, it’s very dated, and in a sketchy part of town with worse traffic and very frequent car break ins. But I’d live right next to my friend which could’ve helped with my loneliness. And I’d have a dedicated office for WFH, which I don’t have now. But those are about the only pros besides saving money, albeit they are large pros. 

In the end and after much ruminating, I decided to stay put at my current place. But ever since, I’ve been eaten up with the fear I made the wrong choice, and now I feel so trapped and stuck. 

I like my place, but now I feel like for the next year I’ll wonder “yeah but what if” and it’s going to tear me up, I can feel it.

The problem is that I’m currently looking for a job, and most job descriptions scare the hell out of me. Most people with my degree (literature) get into teaching but the idea of standing and talking in front of a classroom paralyzes me.

I would be in my computer and suddenly feel my head being fuzzy/dizzy for a split second and then my adrenaline rushed up.I also feel pressure in my head too, I don't know if it's cause I'm thinking about it cause I don't notice it when I'm not thinking about it. I've also been feeling a stabbing pain for a split second  (ice pick headache). And lastly, I've been having brain zaps, and I ruled out that they started cause I stopped taking my antidepressant. But another thing has been bothering me.

I was googling about MRI's and decided to stop and look at some memes on Twitter, when I first opened Twitter there was a video about an MRI which I have never seen before. I was scared God was telling me to get an MRI or something, but decided I was going to let it go, but it happened 3 more times the next day with different things. (I was watching a funny video and a bunch of lips were on the screen and I caught a mc fish that was named something with lip in it at the same exact time.I thought in my head ""I stopped my meds cold turkey that's why this is happening"" and the comic I was reading the time said something about said cold turkey like 2 sec later. LASTLY I told my mom about this video, and it popped up on my fyp later that night)  what are the odds of all these things happening at the same time?? 

Everything that has been happening has been really subtle, I was convinced It was anxiety but now that those things happened I'm scared like this is early signs of a brain tumor and God is warning me. I really hope it's nothing but please do tell me what you think or had similar experiences."

198to4d,Anxiety,2024-01-17,"Martial arts, wrestling, ju-jitsu, etc can significantly strengthen our nervous system &amp; Body confidence","  
1. What do I mean by body confidence? It's  the same event, but experienced by different people, each with their own unique experiences . In people with anxiety or trauma, the nervous system has learned to misfire or mis-alarm. It was a  coping mechanism to protect ourselves from the trauma.

2. Bad upbringing is one of  the main reasons for Anxiety  and  mind-body connection is the best solution.

3. Psychotherapy is effective for correcting cognitive distortions. 

4. Anxiety can manifest in the body  before our thoughts even occur. Thoughts can  be effectively addressed through therapy. However, physical activity is the best way to alleviate trauma in the body. I believe our bodies need those boosts of confidence. The body needs to be connected. 

5. I am considering joining kickboxing, ju-jitsu, martial arts, or wrestling clubs to better connect with my body. So that my body is not only subjected to those dreadful headlocks and submissions, but also learns to remain calm. 

6.  Important thing is connection. Our bodies are still experiencing the effects of childhood trauma or past traumas. Correct me if I'm wrong

198ti0w,Anxiety,2024-01-17,Accidentally giving a guy a wrong number,"What happens in Vegas stays in Vegas right… I had went to a nightclub this past weekend and was invited to a table by this guy. We danced all night and as you can imagine, I was pretty drunk. At the end of the night he came looking for me and had asked for my number. And I’m more than 100% sure I had given him my wrong number because of how drunk I was. It’s been bothering me a lot and I get really bad anxiety thinking about it. I moreso just feel really bad and hope he knows I had a great time with him. How do I release this feeling of guilt and asking “what if?”"
198t968,Anxiety,2024-01-17,Went to the ER last night.,"I ended up in the ER last night because I had such a bad panic attack. My heart rate was 138 by the time I got there, and my blood pressure was 200/97. After observing me for 4 hours, doing an EKG, CAT scan, chest x-ray, multiple blood and urine tests all of which came back good, and watching me on a heart rate and rhythm monitor, they discharged me with a prescription for 0.5mg of Klonopin, and an “official” diagnosis of a severe panic disorder, sinus tachycardia and episodic palpitations. They said all my test came back, good, and on their end, all they could find was anxiety, but they wanted me to go to a primary care, for a potential cardiology referral, based on what the primary care said. The doctors reasons were she didn’t “like the fact it was 138” What the heck is that about?! All my tests came back good, and I even double checked with her that they did! I tried to explain my anxiety to her, but she bluntly, just didn’t seem like she was in the mood. Where do I go from here?"

However, now I have a really bad panic attack and have begun hyperfocusing on my mouth and tongue area. I cannot really concentrate, and feel depressed.

Is this normal? Does it mean my dosage is too high? Does it get better after this?"

198s5iw,Anxiety,2024-01-17,i felt like an absolute loser today,"today was my first day of the semester. i have a class in the middle of the city at a new campus, (it wasn’t offered at my campus and i needed it to graduate.) 

it snowed really badly and i was about ten minutes late to campus, so my anxiety was already kicking in, wondering what’s gonna happen when i walk in late, will everyone judge, professor get snippy, etc.

there were no maps or floor plans in the building OR online. (i checked the night before and i wanted to know where i was going. i climbed all the way to the fourth floor because i couldn’t find an elevator and was just too scared to find someone to ask. at this point, i felt like a huge loser, out of breath, lost and confused, wandering aimlessly. 

i could NOT find my class to save my life. i walked through each hallway on the floor at least 3 times. nobody was around to ask. 

so i went into the bathroom to calm down, maybe check online for a map just to make sure. i hid in the stall just crying and having a panic attack for the remainder of the class period. (hour and a half-ish.)

so now, i missed my first class, feel like an absolute loser, i’m just beating myself up over it again and again and i just don’t know what to do. 

i emailed my professor, explaining i wasn’t dropping the class, and i just wasn’t able to make it due to the weather, but they haven’t responded and i’m just getting more and more nervous. 

my mom and friends don’t know i missed, because i felt so bad that i lied and said i attended. i just feel so horrible right now, and genuinely have no idea what to even do."
198s3i0,Anxiety,2024-01-17,Death in Sleep (Advice)," Hi everyone, I know fear of death has cropped up before, I’m sure many times. 

Context:
  I have a lot of medical related trauma as well trauma related to overdoses and drugs. I’ve nearly died several times and I’m only 19.
I’ve grown up in hospital environments due to health problems (completely unrelated to my heart), and often hospitals are where I feel the safest. Not to mention my mother being a nurse and several other working in medicine. 
  When I try to sleep, I’m constantly afraid my heart will give out. I’m pretty skinny, and have regularly low blood pressure. I should mention I’m also going into medicine. When my chest falls, I can feel my blood pumping against my ribcage, and it’s terrifying. 
   In 2020, I had my heart checked due to this heart related anxiety (back when it hadn’t ruined sleeping yet) and they said it was healthy, despite me having several major, near death overdoses prior. 
   Since then though, I’ve touched cocaine, though not very much. I used to be addicted to prescription opiates, so it’s not really my thing anyway (I now only take opiates as prescribed ! :D). But, unfortunately, I have almost overdosed on it before. I have a pulse and oxygen monitor, and due to my past experiences with overdoses, I felt unwell doing cocaine, and used it. My heart stopped three times, and I did jumping jacks to restart it before driving myself to the hospital. I was fine though after they gave me some anxiety medications after a few hours. 
   I guess what scares me is my heart may be more damaged since my last check up, plus I’ve been smoking more since then too (I don’t intend to quit, save the lecture please, it’s much better than the opiates I used to abuse). 
   I’m absolutely terrified when I try to sleep, I always think to myself «My life has been good the last couple of years, I guess if I die, I’ll have been happy ». I genuinely feel I need to be hooked up to a vitals machine to comfortably sleep, so I can always look and have that security. 

   Please, if anyone has advice, share. I know my situation is probably more on the specific side, but please. This is quite literally making my life hell, when most things have been moving in a positive direction. I’m begging for advice on this.

Things I try that do not work:

- Music (I listen to music every night, many different genres, and silence scares me)

-Breathing of any pattern (It makes me more aware of autonomous functions, such as my heart)

-Candles, essential oils 

-Anxiety medication (I’ve been prescribed many, currently clonazepam works well, but not for this. I will note I have sleeping medication, but it just knocks me out, and falling asleep is still terrifying.)

-Weighted blankets 

-Therapy (I’ve been in therapy my entire life, and really enjoy my current therapist. Talking about these things doesn’t really do much because I have a medical mindset about it)

-Safeguards (Such as always having Narcan, asking people to make sure I’m breathing before they go to bed, ect.)

-More things I probably can’t think of.."

198rjf7,Anxiety,2024-01-17,How to get any sleep?,"I'm currently a few hours into a panic attack, but this isn't my first rodeo. Usually the one's that start at night turn into 1-2 week anxiety attacks that end up going away because I eventually manage to get some food in me and some sleep. I try my best to lay in bed and  doze off but the trembling, the heartburn, and the ""feverish"" nightmares don't help at al,l and I always end up waking up after a couple of hours. As soon as I close my eyes I'm bombarded with very illogical (yet convincing) intrusive thoughts about whatever it is that's bothering me, and my body goes into full panic mode. I really need to sleep but can't figure out how. I used to do this thing where I would build a cabin in my mind and that would usually get me sleepy and relaxed enough, but there's only so many cabins I can build. Anybody got any recommendations? I'll be extremely grateful."
198rdln,Anxiety,2024-01-17,Every little noise I hear at night makes me feel like there’s an emergency,"I live at home, and I’ve developed an intense anxiety about emergencies happening to my family and I won’t be able to hear it because I’m wearing headphones or ignored it for some reason. 

Because of this, for as long as I can remember I’ve never listened to music alone in my room with headphones as I’m afraid someone’s going to knock on my door and I won’t be able to hear it and something bad will happen before I realize what’s going on. 


My dog had a seizure on Christmas, and this feeling has intensified extremely. The exact situation that always plays out in my mind happened, I was playing video games with headphones in and heard commotion downstairs and I ignored it. Then I hear my dad yell come here fast and I realize it was something bad, and it ended up being our dog having her first seizure which was super scary. 

After that night I slept downstairs with her for 2 days, because I felt intense dread and worry about not being around to help her, or not spending enough time with her in what could be her final moments. 

A few weeks passed and she was doing better, but then I woke up one morning and we find a lot of blood and her stool and urine all over the floor, we had slept in too late and weren’t able to let her outside, which likely led to an inflamed colon.

We took her to the vet and got her medication and she’s doing a lot better now, but I am still constantly on edge and literally always thinking about when something happens again.

Every little sound I hear make me just up out of bed to go check on her downstairs, and I don’t want to go anywhere or do anything but be around her. The worry is spilling over into other things, and I’m hyper paranoid about my parents health and hearing noises in the house, as we’ll as general anxiousness and worry in all areas of my life. I’ve been lying awake at night and distracted in my college classes only able to think about this.

Is there anything I can do to help ease this feeling? Is this level of anxiety to be expected when going through a time like this? My mom has a diagnosed anxiety and panic disorder and I feel I have definitely inherited some of that, as a general sense of anxiety has always dictated my life choices."

198qrox,Anxiety,2024-01-17,How do you calm your nerves?,"My anxiety has reached an all time high. I believe it has now manifested into physical symptoms and I am having such a hard time getting it under control these last 2 years. I was barely keeping it together before, but after I had covid in 2021, it was like the dam broke. 

I have weird head buzzing sensations and intense pressure, my whole body vibrates, my IBS is totally out of control. PMDD is even worse now. I get headaches almost every day, I'm dizzy, I can't sleep, my scalp feels like it's burning, heart palpitations, agoraphobia, just a whole mess.

I've been to 2 neurologists, had mris, been to the cardiologist, had sooo much blood work done. All normal. I've changed my diet, I no longer eat wheat or gluten, no caffeine, significantly reduced my sugar intake. I take so many supplements like DHA, vit D, magnesium, potassium, turmeric, ashwagandha. I drink chamomile tea, I put blue light blockers on electronics, I have blue light blocking glasses. I could buy stock in lavender oil. Weed sometimes helps, but sometimes makes it much worse. I take xanax once daily, normally at night because I can't sleep due to my body vibrations. I also started seeing a new therapist. 

I haven't noticed much of a change, except that I've just accepted that this is my life now. Avoiding overstimulation whenever I can. 

I dont know what else I can do besides an antidepressant, but I've taken almost every one in the book and eventually they fizzle out and I'm back to struggling again. Does anyone have any suggestions to try? I have been considering acupuncture, but I'd like to hear your thoughts. Thank you for reading ❤️"
198qpqi,Anxiety,2024-01-17,How do I stop my anxiety while driving?,"Hi, I’m 17, and have been driving for just over a year. I live in a small-ish town and do okay driving on local roads, backroads, to school, to walmart, etc, but I’ve refrained from getting onto the highway because of the anxiety I have about driving.

I’ve been on the highway a total of three times and each time I’ve had someone in the car with me (Driving instructor and dad), and each time I stiffen up and grip the steering wheel like my life depends on it. I particularly do not like changing lanes and getting over. I feel like my mirrors do not show me the cars next to me even after many adjustments, I can’t look over my shoulder like I was taught to do or else I drift, and I have a great fear that I will crash into someone or someone will crash into me and I will get terribly hurt, die, or go to jail.

I do not speed, I stop at lights and signs, I wait my turn, and I obey all traffic laws. But when I make a mistake on the road, even if it’s a simple one like turning a corner too fast, I start to freak out. I tear up, my heart starts to race, I feel like I’m going a million mph, my hands get sweaty, and sometimes I just start to cry silently for the rest of the drive. But please note I’ve never put anyone in danger while on the road, when I feel overwhelmed I stop and park and collect myself. 

I hate this about myself. I really need some advice on how to conquer this fear of mine especially since I am close to graduating high school and will soon be out of my parent’s house and on my own. I’ve been to therapy for anxiety, but it did not help btw. So long story short, how do I not feel anxious when driving? 

Sorry if this is laid out weirdly or incoherently, just trying to jot down some thoughts."

198qak2,Anxiety,2024-01-17,Anxiety about anxiety,"So i had the worst episode this past summer that led me to dissociation and depersonalization for the First time ever. I am still slowly making my way back to ""safety"" mentally and emotionally. 
I am finding myself in a loop though and need help or tips to break out. Its almost like I look for the anxiety mentally. Like checking to see if the big boogy man is there. And my focus is just stuck on my internal world rather than the world around me. My body has learned to constrict and tightly brace up so yhis makes it hard to alow the anxious energy to flow. I feel trapped physically and emotionally. And i start to feel just stuck in the hole of anxiety that doesnt lift all day long . I am happy to be out of dissociation because I was so numb but now I am just stuck in an anxious loop and need help grounding. I tried nature walks, yoga, hot showers , breathing, talking to someone, shopping, eating. Nothing is helping and makes me feel helpless and stuck."
198q9nq,Anxiety,2024-01-17,Scared of dying in my sleep,I have a pretty big feat of death it comes and goes in how intense it is but it's always present. My anxiety only gotten worse as I've gotten much more isolated as of recent and am unable to talk to any friends though I don't really know if they'd wanna talk to me if I was able to. I had some awful tasting water for dinner earlier today and have also been feeling light headed. I had some raw sushi a couple days ago that had a bit of a chewy part to it that I'm not used to. Now I wondering if anything I've experienced with light headed scattered thoughts is attributable to anything I've eaten or drinken. I'm scared to sleep because I feel like tonight might be the night that I die in my sleep because of some kinda virus in my food. I've had a terrible sense of impending doom for a bit now though it's really strong tonight I'm scared my death is soon and I don't know what to do.
198q97f,Anxiety,2024-01-17,I don’t know who I’ve been or where I’m going: A vent on life,"I once realized someone looked at me funny. I would say the moment before that was my peak in life. 

There they were, a funny look on their face. It was not a look of confusion, not for themselves at least. It was a look of “really?”. Looking back, I don’t know what or whom it was for, but in the moment all hope of rational thought were replaced by two things in my head, why is that person looking at me funny and why am I a person deserving of funny looks?

Until then, there was never reason to second guess myself, I was top of my fourth grade class with a record chock full of stickers shaped like stars. Unbeknownst to me, second guessing is a disease of the mind. A disease that found no resistance in a young brain. 

It quickly became my super power; the only one in the room who could notice when anyone needed help. In life there are three facts: people need help, people will not give help without being asked, and people do not ask for help. So I realized the cheat code, just give help to those who need it. Even a quick glance at the right person can change their day. 

But people *need* help. 

“I’m here for you” is a kind statement, lovely even if you don’t mean it. But to mean it and speak with your heart is something else. The look someone gives you when they know, at that moment, your entire world is devoted to them needing help, it is a drug. I quickly learned how to mean it to each person with whom I could be there for. The solution is easy when you think about it, just rip a chunk of your soul out and offer it to them. It is fool proof. A chunk here, a chunk there. I can scatter my soul to the world freely, as kindness begets kindness. 

At the end of the day I can fill the gaps I have cleft out with the pieces given to me by others. Yes I may be the instigator, but at the end of the day I am still whole. 

Wholeish. 

Going strong. 

My mother taught me to be good. I can’t stop. 

Sticking with it. 

Entirely faithful. 

But people *will not* give help without being asked. 

I practiced the faces. You know those faces of strangers that stick with you? The ones where you think “oh they need someone”, while knowing that someone is you? Those faces that haunt me because that someone is me?

I laid it out perfectly. I am after all an excellent planner. I would be gentle initially, thank them for their concern, only to really get into it when they bring it up again later. After all, it should be me aiding them, I just need some affirmations. 

You ever stand near an overlook and subconsciously reach for the railing? You don’t reach because you need it, just getting your bearings. Every once in a while you misjudge the distance and catch nothing but air. Maybe you lean a little too hard into it and stumble a bit. A thought flash past, “I’ve made a mistake”, but before it can’t be realized you hit the railing. Missed by an inch and worried about falling. 

I missed the fact that there was no railing. 

And as has always been true, people *do not* ask for help. 

And I am people. 

As the good problem solver my dad raised me to be, I sat down and found a solution. If I need help I can just get some. It will be easy, I hardly even need help. So next time someone looked me in the eye and gave me an honest “how are you doing”, I cracked.

With thousands of years of social evolution behind me, I managed to smile and let them know I was doing great. If fact I was doing so great they should never ask again. This greatness was beyond question, how would I be helping people if deep down I wasn’t doing great? Just great, everything is great. 

I screamed so loud in my head my own words refused to enter it. 

Such an obvious ruse. Clearly everyone can tell. Obviously “I’m tired” is a cover, they just don’t care. 

Well, they clearly care, I just need to show them more. I can’t assume the world revolves around me. 

Come to think of it, they care so much that they must be great people. And a person of that caliber deserves an easy, happy life. 

And easy happy lives are not filled with sad people. 

The logic could not be more clear. Turns out I am not a sad person. 

Turns out I am *stoic*, or *independent*. How could this be bad if people compliment me? How could I be doing wrong if they were happy that I was so easy and helpful?

But I was easy and helpful last week, so it would be wrong to not do more. The best is only the best with constant improvement after all. 

Eventually I clawed my soul into others. I ignored the agonizing pain. I looked outward to the smiling faces, as inward was a husk. 

Then one day I realized I was not happy. I went to do things that make me happy. That same day I realized I did not want to be happy. 

So life went on. 

Then one day I realized i could not go outside every time I wanted to. That deep down there was something blocking me. So I put on my brave boy pants and reached out. 

I had seen posters and ads all over, “seek therapy! We are here for you”. So I gave all my greatest effort towards putting myself in front of those who could help. 

And it was all good news! I am not suicidal! I am doing way better than the normal patients! I am doing so well it is a three month wait! I have a stable life and a family so I should be grateful!

But the screaming in my head got louder. 

Yet I accepted the answer of the people who could help. All it takes is some practice. Maybe some pills. Just a weekly visit. And an online coach. 

All valid solutions. All offered at my time of need. But therapists are people. And people like when you give the right answer. 

I broke down. I could not win the fight against myself. Unless there was a paper trail? I messaged my therapist. I spilled my fatal secret. I was not great. 

But the late night writings are calmly brushed off by confidence. How can I be suffering if I can look you dead in the eye and lie about how great things are?

Turn out “I’m a liar”, makes people trust your honesty. 

That night the screaming in my head got so loud I could not hear the music of the world. I stopped existing even to myself. 

And so time did as time does and years passed. I built the perfect little box for people to look in and see “doing well”. I was too busy for people to worry, after all I was out doing things so often they barely saw me. 

I was so busy I could barely get sleep after sitting alone at home every night cancelling plans. 

It gotten better, no doubt about that. Some days I can even hear a compliment over the screaming in my head. 

I am a very smart person. I am charismatic, empathetic, a hard worker, and creative to boot. I can do anything I set my mind to. 

Turns out my mind is set on bringing me down. 

I had but one option left. I must take radical action to protect myself against myself. If I can build barriers between me and to world, I can build them internally as well. 

I organized my brain. Each part knows it is not the whole, but believes it is the main. I can be dedicated now as I will only know one purpose. I just can’t tell which purpose will lead my tomorrow. 

There is no end, no wall to cling to. I am me and will ever only be me. I am no longer sad, for that was me yesterday. I am free to achieve greatness, if that is the me of today. I see truth. The same truth I have told people my entire life. 

But the blinds stay closed and the screaming is not quieter, there are just no ears to hear it. 

Sorry if you read this in hope of a point. There are no happy endings halfway through a story. 

TLDR: I’m great, how are you?"

198px0v,Anxiety,2024-01-17,"It's like- the third time, I post this here.","I'm still, really , paranoic with if I did wrong by searching if I said the n-word by putting  my username of my old acc (deleted) and it to see if I ever ever said it (I didn't, in the end, through all searches I didn't , even when I searched in my keyboard, there was nothing.) But now, I'm worried, I did wrong by searching it? I did wrong by looking if I ever committed such mistake?? I don't know , I don't know really and it is hurting my brain . I'm 14y.o, turned 14 In 20/12, I thought this would disappear, friends of mine said ""what matters is that you didn't said it"" strangers on internet say the same thing, say that I didn't did anything , but I can't. I just can't.
I have many broken memories, many, many, Im tired of depending in my pendulum to define if I did our didn't did something, I self diagnosed me with schizophrenia, because, I feel there is no other answer, since I was 6 I was like this, paranoic, anxious, would see things other don't, would have memories that never existed, why I need to keep suffering with it?? I searched on my WhatsApp, old twitter account (both that you can write what are you looking for) I searched through old conversations on Instagram with friends of mine, but obviously, if I did something like this they would warn me immediately, and simply, nothing. 

I'm from Brazil, this slur got only know here in 2020, but, what if when I was a kid and singed a song I said it?? Even though it is impossible since when I was ""acting"" (dancing around and pretending I was budding a cenário with my characters or characters I like (do this since nowadays )) I wouldn't even move my mouth, only did it once and stoped after it. 
My pendulum always says, I didn't ever said it, gesticulated my mouth to it, moved my mouth , moved my tongue , whispered , or said it in a censored way or anything, simply, didn't said it, but I keep self boycotting myself, I keep I keep until I simply give up, one part of me, wants really to live but other simply feel I shouldn't, and if I keep with my project, I shall make myself anom and post it on the internet. I don't know if I should listen to any of them or to the people around me.

About my psychologist? She is nice, but base herself to much on stereotypes, I study about autism (since 2022-2023), schizophrenia (since 2023) and many other neurodivergences  or psychological diagnosis, and I simply get so confused, I see myself in these two mainly by the symptoms and everything simply, but my psychologist says ""if you were autistic you would look in my eyes or even be talking with me "" ""autistic people hate lies and don't lie"" or say that I'm supposely """"normal"""" if I was autistic or schizophrenic would it make me any less human being ? I just can't understand, it's so hard, and all I want is a way to get myself out of this suffering I've been passing through and is only getting worse."

nerves have nothing to do with confidence but that’s not necessarily the thing that gets me 

it just pisses me off so much that even matters to people. because that means people with anxiety (me) can’t date because they (me) don’t come off as confident and that’s apparently a dealbreaker lmfao 

watch me be both. i can absolutely be confident in so many ways and still have no idea how to speak like a normal person when im meeting someone new."

You observe, without judgement, whatever comes up for you in the moment, and then let it pass. You feel the uncomfortable feelings, have the worrisome thoughts, **and** at the exact same time, move toward what is making you anxious. In other words, feel bad, and do it anyway.""

It doesn’t always happen but today I was semi-anxious and I guess I wasn’t eating much.  By the time dinner rolled around I had the worst anxiety attack I’ve had in over two years. Felt my hands shaking slightly even.

I dont have any breathing problems and there doesn't seem to be any evidence of any swelling, inflammation, or me having any colds or sicknesses that can cause these sensations so I worry its all in my head. What can I do to just stop feeling myself out all the time and ruining my enjoyment of sleeping at night and going about my day?

I also have a part time job as a swim instructor (need it for my high yield savings) my anxiety comes and goes I’ll have a bad week and the  two good weeks no specific pattern or anything. Ok basically I picked up a bunch of shifts to help out at the swim school since someone quit. I really want to build a new pc so I was like screw it the extra money could help. I committed to 4 days M-T for 3 weeks. I would dedicate Fridays for my business and answer emails and edit and what not. These have been the most amazing 3 weeks of my life it’s like my anxiety just disappeared. This week my help was no longer needed  so I went back to my regular routine of “ nothing” and the anxiety is back. Is having a routine a big part of managing anxiety? It’s crazy to believe
How so many people in my life have told me they wish they had what I have and barely have to work and make good money but I kinda don’t like this. Any advise is greatly appreciated. Thanks!"

I know it’s messed up but I have crippling anxiety &amp; panic attacks. Almost daily. I don’t live anymore. 

When I get the HUGE panic attack &amp; lose it totally, I end up cutting &amp; snapping rubber bands… after a while, I’m calm. Other coping methods help but only for a short while or just minor relief.

Why does physical pain… relieve me the most? Nothing is more powerful than this unhealthy coping mechanism.

Now I don’t do it often. I do try to fight. So I am not scarred up here. I do pinch myself a lot tho. I did cut last night… the other time was like a month ago so yeah. But Idk why this snaps me out of it.

Is it just me?"
198opti,Anxiety,2024-01-17,Wondering if This is Just Me?,"26F here. Been diagnosed with anxiety since I was 15.

I had some sort of… giant panic attack almost a year ago. I got super freaked out that something bad had happened, but it ended up being fine.

However, I had a cold feeling in my chest for over a week, along with general chest pain. It was cold in the upper left side of my chest. I also was practically unable to eat anything, as my stomach hurt too much to do so.

Then, the symptoms subsided, and for the next month or two, were replaced by random shock-like feelings in my chest almost every day, usually when I was going to sleep. I also lacked the energy/excitement to do anything outside of basic necessities. I would occasionally have a “good” day, where I had my energy back.

I should mention that halfway through that period, I had another very stressful event. I don’t think that the symptoms got worse, but I definitely remember crying almost every night.

I started cymbalta(?), but it kept making me lightheaded, and I couldn’t handle it with my health scares at that time.

Those things have also resolved, but I get random palpitations now. Notably when I squat down, walk, or try to sleep. I get ~1 every day or few days.. or it will go away for several weeks. It feels kind of like my heart is dropping into my stomach.

All of my EKGs, bloodwork, and CT scan came out normal, so I know it isn’t health related… at the same time, I’ve never heard of someone having this much of a problem just from anxiety.

Have you gone through this?"
198oo2m,Anxiety,2024-01-17,Anxiety out of nowhere??,"Lately I’ve been struggling a lot with anxiety, and it all seems to be out of nowhere. I’m 21 years old, I’ve never really struggled with anxiety at any point of my life before 2023. In March of 2023, I went to go to bed one night and every time I was right about to fall asleep, I would stop breathing and jolt back awake. It got to the point where I felt like I couldn’t breathe and I thought I was dying/something was wrong with my heart. I ended up going to the ER and they ran tests on my chest and determined there was nothing wrong. The doctor asked if I had anything going on and I mentioned a breakup that happened recently. He ended up saying I had sleep apnea and possibly general anxiety disorder. After 2 days I was back to normal. About 3 months later I started having weird sensations in my head that would happen out of the blue, kind of like a tingling that would worry me slightly. After about a week of it happening constantly throughout the day I went to the doctors and they recommended I get bloodwork done. The tests came back normal, but shortly after I got my blood drawn the sensations didn’t happen nearly as often and eventually stopped. Fast forward about 5-6 months, in December 2023 I started sleeping naturally for around 10-12 hours while still feeling tired for no reason that was apparent to me. After a week or so, I started to feel anxious in situations that made no sense to me. I would be with family and I would be very anxious around them. My head would feel strange riding in the car with my family and I would be hiding full blown panic attacks that i’m guessing were being caused by the weird sensations in my head or vice versa. By the very end of December my head would feel strange basically the entire day and I started noticing a slight numbness around the top and back of my head. It’s been about 2 weeks now and it only seems to be getting worse. Basically most of my body has a slight numbness, most nights as I drift off to sleep my head will almost zap me back awake for at least 30 minutes, in situations I used to be slightly nervous in now I feel a massive amount of anxiety and my head is constantly either under pressure and/or tingling. Is it normal for anxiety to come on the strong out of nowhere? Is it normal for my anxiety to not have a clear trigger and to cause my head to have an intense, irritable tingling? Will medication help?
Anything helps guys and I hope everyone is doing okay in here."
198hczn,Anxiety,2024-01-16,"I had two anxiety attacks today, is that bad?","Alright, today in math class I was working when I suddenly felt very hot, tingly and as if I couldn't breathe. At lunch I went to see a staff member in their room who helped me calm down, helped me with my breathing and even let me sniff some essential oils. That's the first one. The second one was when we were viewing a presentation on online safety, there were multiple factors to this one. 
1) there was a police officer/resource officer who had a gun (in their holster) and due to an incident (drunk mom)  I dislike and get panicky around officers.
2) they talked about sex, sexual assault and all that. And they brought up suicide too. I've had negative experiences with these, which fueled my attack. 

I again, went to the staff room like earlier, and they helped me out again. Is this normal? Or should I get checked out?"

The thump followed with my head tingling feet tingling and sweaty, dizziness, tightness in the chest and difficulty catching my breathe. Went to the ER and they did all the cardiac tests and said I had acid reflux. Ever since then I’ve had the same symptoms, and different ones that I’ve never had before; such as weird head aches, shaky feelings in my legs, random chest pains, random pains all over my body and some nausea, body vibrations, random hot flashes, adrenaline feeling and eyes strain. I’ve lost 30 pounds. The main scary symptoms happen when I am driving, once I get out and move around they usually subside and I’ll feel tired or drained after. I’m wondering if this could be anxiety, or panic attacks. Every one I’ve talked to thinks that’s what it is but I mentally do not feel anxious.

Car exploding, getting electrocuted, etc).

It took me 3 days to get around to changing my battery because the ""moment never felt right.""

I finally did get around to changing my car battery today, though i had trouble since it was -20C outside, so everything was frozen. Other minor issues aroused (last person who changed my batteries bent my hold down so i had to find a way to put it back, said person also put the plastic covering the wrong way, so it made it harder to lift up the already heavy battery). What seemed like something that shouldn't take more than 10 minutes took me close to probably 45 min to do. 
I did it anyways, and my car succesfully started. I didn't feel any relief, but was flooded with more anxiety that i probably did something wrong along the way. I keep thinking: did i screw things too tightly? Not tight enough? Did i hit a cord or something that would cause something to malfunction later on?
How can i stop this? I feel like whenever i resolve my anxiety attack, something else pops up and my mind creates situations that FEEL ALL TOO REAL.

My situation is a little complicated as I have postpartum anxiety, but it’s been absolutely horrible. Now that I’m getting ready to go back to work, I’ve started having anxiety when just talking to people (even friends or family). Specifically if they ask me a question that I have to think about or give a recap (for example my mom asked how my daughter’s doctor appointment went), my chest starts to tighten and one time it led to a panic attack where my entire body basically seized. I’m terrified this is going to happen at work and it’s going to spiral to the point where I lose my job and then my daughter loses her insurance. I’m on Zoloft and Ativan, but I’m afraid to rely too heavily on the Ativan. I was wondering if anyone had any advice or is in a similar situation?

i’m laying in bed with my stomach hurting, but I can’t seem to want to eat anything. things have happened that have caused my anxiety to ramp up it debilitates me. i could think about and KNOW I need to eat but my throat starts to tighten and my stomach gets so tense and uneasy. i get so numb. i need nutrition but i just can’t do it. i wish this was easier. i hate that anxiety paralyzes my body and causes me not to tend to my everyday needs, even sometimes unconsciously."
198kxoc,Anxiety,2024-01-17,Anxiety or allergy?,"Hi all, so I struggle with pretty bad anxiety and have convinced myself I might be allergic to salmon.  I’m not allergic to anything else bu one time while I was eating salmon my mouth felt kind of weird and I fully convinced myself I’m allergic. If I am allergic would my throat close from anaphylactic shock IMMEDIATELY after the first bite? Or hours later? I’ve read different things so I’m a bit confused. Anxiety and allergies have a lot of the same symptoms, I get a tight throat but it could be anxiety. I know the obvious answer is to go get allergy tested or stop eating salmon, but I guess I just want to learn more about what will happen if I am actually allergic. Can anyone tell me about their first storied eating something they were allergic to and what happened? My actual worst nightmare is my throat closes after eating it or hours later when I’m sleeping…. anxiety is great."
198ks0h,Anxiety,2024-01-17,I think my Whatsapp was hacked and now my anxiety has sky rocketed putting me back into a rut that's I've slowly being getting out of.,"I'll try not to get carried away because I often can when explaining things. I have been on here occasionally to read other posts. Some I could relate to and always found the replies helpful. So today I am making a post. As the title says, I think my WhatsApp was hacked, an update was posted (WhatsApp version of an Instagram story) that I didn't post. It contained a pink background and random letters, emojis and a Sri Lanka flag. 

Since I noticed this, I've been on high alert It's natural to check things like other apps to see if they had been accessed but they had not. But I've falling back onto compulsions and routines. Unlike other people who had been hacked on WhatsApp, I was not logged out, or the hacker did not try implement a 2fa, or message other people. The emojis they used were showing up as my recently used emojis on my phone so I think they accessed my phone and account. Every few minutes I am taking a snap and looking at my emojis to see if the same ones have been used again or any I didn't use are in my recent. As of the last year or so, technology and social media has caused a lot of my anxiety. 

I'm checking different apps constantly to see any changes, messages sent etc. I stupidly linked my WhatsApp on my phone to my laptop for WhatsApp web hours ago however it only something along the lines came up on my phone 1hr ago or so that my devices were logged out as syncing to phone data was lost communication (something like that) even though I had logged out of my laptop hours ago. And as of 2hrs ago it was saying there was no device linked. So that's an example of a change that has me anxious another being even an app being slow to load makes me think it's cause I've been hacked and I then think something bad will happen (it may happen as the nature with hacking) as I can't understand why they'd only put up a story on my whatsapp? I'm constantly giving into compulsions and carrying out the same routines ontop of ones I already had before this. I was looking forward to trying to better my routine but now I feel I'lll be up all night and this will make my horrible lifestyle continue.  I logged into my email this morning long before this happened and now that email password is suddenly the profile picture on my laptop. I noticed that I had click sign in on the laptop too when it went to sleep which you never have to do. Again I feel like now they've taken over my laptop even though they may not have because I used the laptop for WhatsApp online to try log myself out of all devices (to log them out too) and I used my email to activate 2 factor authentication after I seen the update/story on whatsapp that was posted. I over think things a lot despite this being a serious matter. 

Does anyone have any advice for my panicking and fears? Thank you to anybody that has read this far and to anybody in advance who comments. As aforementioned there are great people who reply with fantastic comments which are informative and helpful. I respect anyone who takes the time out to try help someone out. Thank you."
198kpct,Anxiety,2024-01-17,What happens if you get hospitalized for anxiety?,"or, as the kids call it, a grippy sock vacation lol. my anxiety is at its worst, i'm functioning but just barely and if my new meds don't start working i don't know what to do. I'm always on the verge of an panic attack but it never tips over into a full one. i'm on a yummy cocktail of pills that have worked for 10 years and suddenly they aren't. i feel trapped in my body and that i'm going to die or go insane at any moment.

i'm aware those are just the anxiety thoughts. i know I'm not going crazy or going to die. ive done CBT and DBT and all that fun stuff. i just imagine a so-called grippy sock vacation for general anxiety would just be learning that stuff again and upping my meds? i'm somewhat of an agoraphobe too so being away from home and being around other mentally unstable strangers and doctors sounds like it'd make things worse? (not trying to be ableist lol but let's be real. i can't even deal with myself, how can I deal with other people like me?) i did outpatient treatment for depression oncr, fat load of shit that did tbh. but maybe something like that would help for anxiety? I don't know.

i don't know. I just really want a vacation from the world. shut myself away in my room, not work, not socialize, not read the news, nothing. if i do that i think it'd be a step backwards in recovery. with how bad my agoraphobia's been going lately, i might just be tempted to just go full shut-in hikikkomori mode."
198kpbf,Anxiety,2024-01-17,"Tightness around base of thumb. A*S, obviously. /s","Hey folks. I’m hoping y’all can help me calm down my lizard brain a bit.

On Christmas Eve, I started to notice this odd “tight” sensation in my thumb. It kinda starts down towards the base. There’s no weakness, no trembling. In fact, it seems to function perfectly normal. The only thing I’ve noticed is that when I try gaming, it starts to hurt within a few minutes. After I finish, it feels significantly more tight. After 15-20 minutes, it’s relatively back to normal.

It seems to fluctuate. I’ll have some parts of the day where I won’t notice things at all. Then I’ll have some where it’s persistent. At times, it even feels like my index finger gets weird. Or even my other fingers feel funny on my other hand. Again, though all of this, no loss of function to speak of. Just, “off”.

My intrusive thoughts are telling me this is the start of some awful neurological something or another. Since Christmas, I’ve went back and forth between P@rki&amp;$0&amp;’S and @L$. As in, I’ve essentially made peace with my impending death/disability and am ready for my body to start shutting down on me. And then sometimes, I realize it might be a legit repetitive motion injury or something *entirely* in my head.

I say RMI because this started right after I’d spent the better part of a week playing *God of War: Ragnarok* non-stop on the highest difficulty. I was really going hard at it. And I also mention the mental part because I’ve been insanely stressed over the past few months. My dad had cirrhosis and took a sharp decline around Thanksgiving. He passed away on the 4th. So, on top of my anxiety being awful most of the time anyways, I’ve been dealing with everything that comes with losing a parent.

I could use some reassurance. Or advice. The logical part of my brain is telling me that this is nothing serious, and may be nothing at all. But my lizard brain is screaming **DANGER DANGER** and making everything else just shitty AF."
198jero,Anxiety,2024-01-17,Mobile app to help with Social Anxiety.,"I have have had social anxiety for as long as I remember. It has brought me pain and suffering and prevented me to grow in my life. I’m also a programmer so I have decided to build a mobile app designed for iOS, with a focus on helping users navigate and overcome social anxiety through exposure therapy. The app may include features such as simulated social scenarios, real-time feedback, and the potential integration of a virtual assistant. The goal is to create a supportive and controlled environment for users to practice and build confidence in various social situations. I’ll be sharing my progress as I build this app, and I welcome your thoughts and feedback.

I’ve taken a day or two and sometimes almost a week off a couple times and never had any issues, but then found out about severe WD symptoms and if I choose to not drink a night my mind makes me think im going to start hallucinating or have seizures as it tends to do with any other horrible thing thag exists in this world that could happen to me. im 25 YO male.

198ifqg,Anxiety,2024-01-17,Clonazepam 0.5mg,"I got prescribed a 0.5mg Clonazepam long time ago to use as needed for sleep.  However, due to it being a Benzodiazepine I was always scared of taking it due to bad press and only took it one or twice for sleep.   Recently my anxiety has gotten a lot worse, so I decided to take one pill and instead of sleeping, do errands that make me anxious like shopping, I live in a big city so it is hard to move around if you have a fear of being perceived.

It worked wonders.  I was able to go shopping and get some needed clothes!  Afterwards I met with my friend at a restaurant and I felt so at ease.  It was easy to speak, I had control over my words.  No sweating, or itchiness, or throwing up.  Just present.  I understand this is a very delicate category of medication, however, I feel this is the only thing that works.  Even 2 days after taking, I felt more at ease knowing I had it in case I needed it.

This was a prescription from my old psychiatrist which I had to switch due to a change in health insurance.

This psychiatrist wants to try Cymbalta with me.  However, I have tried Venlafaxine that's in the same category and it didn't work well.  I have tried, Lexapro, Wellbutrin, Prozac, Amitriptyline, Buspirone.  And to be completely frank, I am tired of taking a medication for 2 months and experiencing all the side effects but no benefits.

Can people please share their experience with this medication?  And is it hard to get it prescribed in a ""as needed basis?"""

198i1d7,Anxiety,2024-01-16,Anxiety diagnosis?,"Hi

I'm a bit confused about a diagnosis.

Started getting a lot of sinus headaches/facial pain in December 2022 and no cause has been found as of yet but isn't related to sinusitis. 

In May 2023 i had an onset of abdominal pain, urinary issues which is still ongoing. Ive had all kinds of investigations but nothing has been found.

From my original presentation in May, some of my infection markers were up and I was treated with antibiotics but since then nothing has been raised.

They feel it might be IBS and pelvic pain syndrome but no firm diagnosis.

On my medical notes from that, it states that I have been anxious but I've put this down to pain and not knowing what's going on, rather than feeling anxious.

The times I've been seen by a health professional I just get told 'You're anxious', but it makes me wonder that nothing can be found and this is what they are just telling me it is.

I have never been an anxious person, very outgoing etc.

I feel like the more I'm getting told 'Youre anxious', the more I'm wondering if I am.

I don't feel anxious and I feel the only thing holding me back is the abdominal pain and sinus headaches.

Is It worth seeing my GP to try a medication to see if it makes a difference?"
198i0hp,Anxiety,2024-01-16,"Im in lawschool, but i have crippling anxiety","Hi! Im in lawschool, and i really have bad anxiety. 
Ever since i was young, i really disliked going to school bc a lot of people bullied me bc of unknown reasons lmao i was a child. Anyway, i was super excited to transfer school bc of new scenery and yet again i was bullied. I really remembered some days that I really dreaded going to school bc i hate feeling anxious about ppl but i just went bc ofc i had to go to school. Got over the anxiety and finished my education, even finished college and got my bachelors degree.

Now, im in law school and the first year was pretty great, made new friends, normal highs and lows. 

But this year, my anxiety returned. I dont wanna go to school, i dont wanna do anything, i dont wanna function, i find myself staring at the wall, drifting apart from reality, often wanna sleep etc. i really really hate school atm bc my main motivators, my friends, are not my classmates anymore, also cant absorb information when reading anymore bc i am anxious. I also am scared of failing as i failed a subject and now im doubting my capabilities.

What do i do? Help!!!

i tried exercising, watching a movie, it doesnt work anymore 😭😭

To add: I really wonder why im feeling this way. I was never the type to be scared in making new friends as i am an extrovert who loves new environment and i can even come across as someone who’s bubbly, always happy &amp; v confident but this year, i feel exhausted, unmotivated and scared of making new friends and i find myself not drawn to doing anything. Im also someone who achieves academically so idk whats the matter.  😭

198hyyy,Anxiety,2024-01-16,Can’t even see my own family,"For the past few years I’ve dealt with anxiety, but it has just got worse and worse. The past couple of months I can barley even talk to my own mum and dad for too long, i start to get dizzy and feel like I’m going to cry and my voice feels like it’s going weird. I haven’t went to see any of my family in months because of this, I just lock myself away in my room. Even at my mental health appointments I can’t talk to them.

I started using alcohol as a way to cope because when I drink it makes me so confident I can speak to anyone I have tried two different anti depressants but none of them have helped the 2nd one I was on I recently stopped taking last week because she said it wasn’t safe to take because of the alcohol. I have an appointment with an alcohol person soon but I don’t see how they can help me I don’t care what the risks are of drinking I would do anything to stop being so anxious all the time. I’m only 17 and can’t go to collage, barley went to high school because of anxiety 

I tried weed a few times to help but it didn’t help it just made me dissociate and make me really paranoid. I found a website online that I could try to by Xanax from but the issue is getting it at the door without my mum seeing I feel like this is my only option now after years, I want to have a life, there is so much things I want to do but I can’t because of this

I had a particularly difficult situation come up with a friend and a task she assumed I would do. I did not have the time or money for this favor, nor did she ask permission. The assumption that I would help really bothered me. I was able to identify that I was upset she felt entitled to my time and money.

And then...drumroll...I set an appropriate boundary! Instead of me seeing it a punitive action, it's just a rule I'm placing to protect my happiness and wellbeing. She took the response very well and it's almost as if it was a non-issue.

Everything around me then becomes kind of foggy? I begin to panic because the feeling is uncomfortable, almost like choking/drowning and not knowing how to escape the feeling.

My mind then starts to panic as it feels like I could be stuck in this feeling forever and I almost want to rip my skin off/knock myself out to escape it? Even when it calms down, it's like the feeling follows me for the rest of the day trying to get me again.

198hkr0,Anxiety,2024-01-16,Debate about anxiety/ credibility with flat mate,"""context as short as possible""

We talked about why some people are afraid to go to the blackboard at the college, i motivated that probably because of anxiety, refering to anxiety as to an unfounded fear. He told me that it is not unfounded because if you're wrong you're credibility is affected. I didn't had the same opinion because in general one mistake does not affect your credibility/ life, at least not as much as to make change your life for the worse. He said that after your credibility is afected, your social life is too, and so on. I told him that he is a bit too dramatic.

Any opinions about this? Can something like that even repeated do radical changes/have an impact in your life / social life? or it is just anxiety, and you should try to get over it in different ways (ex by dissecting the fear you feel and working on what makes you feel like that)

I hope i explained the situation pretty decent, thanks for your time"

198ge42,Anxiety,2024-01-16,Anyone wanna help ease my mind with my Physical Anxiety?,"Hey there, so about three weeks ago, I started feeling these strange internal vibrations all over my body; they basically are here 24/7 if I focus hard enough. They've been getting better however, but when I really focus on them or when I'm lying in bed, they hit pretty strong, especially in my legs.  
  
Since then, I've noticed myself getting more stressed, worrying it could be something serious, especially with other symptoms popping up. Just reaching out to see if anyone else has gone through something similar and if they can help me ease this stress and anxiety. I'm a (29M) and I've never dealt with anxiety like this before, so it's all new territory to me.  
  
I know the golden rule is not to play doctor with yourself or Google symptoms, but, well, I did it anyway, which I feel I shouldn't have and I'm stupid for doing so as it has made me more anxious.  
  
Here are some of the symptoms I've been experiencing:  
  
\- Internal tremors  
\- Aches and weakness in my legs and arms. Right now, my shoulder hurts, but it doesn't feel weak. Before that, right above my knee felt kind of numb. Not sure if it's phantom pain or the real deal.  
\-Brief muscle tingles  
\-Muscle twitches, often in the same spot. Lately, my eyelid has been twitching, and I notice it more when I touch my face or blink a lot.  
\-Headaches, sometimes the headaches hurt behind my eyes. But it feels more of like a tension headache when it is there.  


My mind tends to race, entertaining thoughts of it being something serious like MS, which is pretty scary. The internal tremors started out of the blue, and as I got more anxious, all these other symptoms tagged along in the following weeks. Thankfully, no physical tremors yet, but when I get super anxious or scared, my hands shake a bit.  
  
I got a blood test and an abdominal ultrasound, and the doctor reassured me that I'm perfectly healthy. Still, I insisted on an MRI just to ease my mind. But since the doctor's verdict of good health, it only makes me worry more about what serious thing could be causing all this. I really hope it's just anxiety. The waiting for the MRI test and then having to wait for the results makes me even more anxious.  
  
Just reaching out to see if anyone has had similar anxiety symptoms like mine. Appreciate any insights or advice. Thank you!"

I don't feel like Sertraline is really working at all for anxiety AT all. I still feel super anxious and have spiralled. I'm wondering whether to go up, or try something else or.. idk. 

Has anyone else experienced taking this drug at this dose? Any recommendations?

I’m curious. It’s not a lingering pain it kinda just comes and goes. At first i thought it might be something gut/heart burn related of some sort but i don’t feel like it is. Or it still might be but I’m no doctor lol but i do get extra anxious when i feel it because i have had a heart attack before at a young age do to genetics but its definitely not the same pain i felt when i had the attack that was so HORRIBLE i still kinda felt it through the morphine.

I saw my doctor today to request a medication for my debilitating anxiety with some depressive symptoms. I was expecting him to give lexapro or buspar but instead he prescribed me Mirtazapine and said to follow up with him in 2 weeks...  
Is this a medication that might help with anxiety and depression? I believe the dose he gave was 15mg to be taken at night. I am asking because upon researching it seems to be a sedative which may help with my sleep and appetite issues but it seems unclear weather this would have any affect on my anxiety and depression during the day time like the next day after taking it.  
Can anyone else who is more familiar with this medication please enlighten me? I believe I can get another appointment for thursday to ask for a different med or else I also have an old bottle of zoloft sitting in my cupboard that i never took but am considering starting tonight since i already have the follow up appointment in 2 weeks so i could just tell him i started the zoloft instead of the mirtazapine.

198e7qp,Anxiety,2024-01-16,"I'm feeling increasingly overwhelmed, and am failing at my job.","
I've (28f)  been feeling exhausted and overwhlemed at work since a year. This happened gradually. Eventhough I had a hard time organizing my life and thoughts, my inability to focus and pay attention on the task in hand has not affected my Work. It has affected my studies - but i thought it was depression or anxiety based on the symptoms. I seeked therapy for my anxious thoughts, and couldn't continue for various reasons. 6 months ago, I reached out for therapy again. I met with a psychiatrist for a few sessions as well, and she said my symptoms indicate ADHD, and that a separate assessment/session needs to be conducted in the presence of a parent, for an accurate diagnosis. I was prescribed escitalopram and clonazepam for a short period, to check if feeling less anxious would help with identifying the issue. I informed my mom about it, and have been waiting for a follow-up from the psychiatrist. I've sent a follow-up a while ago, and am still waiting for the response.  

I used to be good at work, mostly by compensating my lack of attention and inability to complete tasks efficiently in a short time - with quietly working extra hours. Although it is an unhealthy work place, I realized that I am taking extremely long hours as compared to others, and that is when I reached out for help. Lately, I am unable to complete any task that involves a deadline as well. I have a high stake task for tomorrow, the kind that could invalidate most of my hardwork of 2 years if i don't finish it, but I just can't get to it. I feel so helpless. I want to leave my job, and not worry about finding another one, and just give myself a break. But I know that it would be difficult if I don't find another job shortly. Despite growing up with very low self-esteem and confidence, my work was one thing that made me feel good about myself. And now, I feel like a failure, like I will lose all the progress I've made and will never be able to work well.  

Is it a bad idea to leave my job for 2-3 months (i will still have a month notice period to get through) ? Is it going to get better with medication, or am I just doomed? I am sorry for the hopeless rant. I was suicidal for about 8 years, and eventually started feeling better 2 years ago. Then, after a year, everything seemed to go downhill. I don't know what to do anymore. I just want to feel calmer, and utilize my time to work on the endless list of personal and professional pending tasks. I don't have the energy to exercise, but can't help but feel like eating is the only solution. I feel anxious all the time.   

I just want to be able to sleep when I'm tired, and not feel like my heart is going to explode. Does it ever get better?"

198dtp5,Anxiety,2024-01-16,I'm just tired,"Hello,

I just need to share my troubles somewhere. I have been dealing with anxiety disorder for six years and likely depression (experiencing depressive episodes). I apologize if my post seems chaotic; I'm just pouring out my feelings right now. I feel like I don't fit into this world. I'm 21 years old and studying Computer Science at university. Unfortunately, I think the level of teaching at my university is low. That's why I'm taking courses and working on projects (front-end), but I struggle with procrastination.

I believe I know why I'm procrastinating—I fear the moment when I start a task/project and encounter difficulties. When things go wrong, I become increasingly anxious, lose focus, immediately feel too stupid for it, and can't overcome it. In these moments, I feel miserable, want to cry (but can't), and nothing seems to make me feel better. I don't have anyone to confide in.

I'm worried because I still don't know if this field is right for me, but nothing else interests me. I enjoy creating web pages, but, as I mentioned, I procrastinate a lot. What if I graduate, find or don't find a job in IT, and realize it's not for me? I don't know what else I could do. I just want to be happy in my life.

I've never worked, and I'm terrified of going to work (anywhere, not just in IT). Sending out my resume gives me stress headaches. I'm also afraid of spending money because of this. I feel like time is slipping away, I'm wasting my life, and something bad might happen, causing me to break down. I fell like I am getting more stupid and experiencing something like brain fog.

I've tried therapy three times, but it didn't help, and I was on SSRIs for three years (which suppressed my emotions).

I don't know what to do. I'm just tired. Every day feels the same, and I rarely leave the house."
198dtnm,Anxiety,2024-01-16,Sleep anxiety,"I had a Traumatic event about 2 years ago and have experienced anxiety during the day since (particularly a worry that I will randomly faint and get hurt, because that’s what happened, I fainted and snapped my neck in three places). I fought through that anxiety and now all of a sudden my anxiety is sleep related. I simply can’t fall asleep, I think about the positions giving me back that terrible neck pain, then not getting enough sleep, and I just can’t seem to fall asleep in the end. The weird part is that I slept totally fine since the incident until about a month ago. I was unemployed on the job market which I thought could be keeping me up at night but now I have a good job and it’s a weight off my shoulders. I genuinely feel nervous about sleeping because I can’t do it. It feels like I forgot how to… 

I take melatonin and magnesium. No luck. I really need to fix this because the lack of sleep is amplifying other worries. Any advice"
198drru,Anxiety,2024-01-16,"Brain Burning (stress response) and Anxiety Hangover - sharing my experience, but hoping someone else out there can relate","*BRAIN BURNING*

I have been dealing with chronic illness that weirdly triggered some other symptoms, which I couldn’t make sense of, for a few weeks now. I got labs and nothing came back that suggested I was dealing with anything other than my chronic pain, but because I have intense illness anxiety, I was not convinced. Next thing I know, I am suffering panic attacks, on top of my general anxiety surrounding the situation, and frantically researching non stop. Then I developed this weird pain in my head. I could only describe it as some sort of inflammation - it was like sinus pain, that only impacted the center and sides of my head. 

I noticed this discomfort tended to subside when I would take a shower, get fresh air, or the few moments I managed to be calm. But then I would start fretting about my chronic illness I am dealing with, and suddenly my head would flare up again. My mind went to dark places. I used every keyword you could think of in my online searches; I started stressing over whether I could have meningitis. I was quite literally losing it. But then I finally googled the words ‘Brain Burning’ and ended up finding a multitude of articles that break down how many people with anxiety and/or OCD experience this feeling where their head feels very hot, like there’s warm liquid in it, or there’s a buzzing; its often worsened during stress, and notably subsides when the individual is distracted or at ease. Essentially, your brain is in fight or flight mode; it is.a stress response that can cause a surge of blood to the brain. If it’s an on/off sensation, and you can pinpoint it to times that you are feeling particularly distressed or worried, that is even more evidence that you are dealing with that — which I now feel confident explains way what I was feeling. 

In my case, I think it was at first, a physical stress response - my body feeling under attack because the inflammation I was experiencing from my chronic illness. But then my panicking tripled down on everything. 


*HANGXIETY*

Next I want to talk about Hangxiety (Anxiety Hangover) or Post Panic Attack Anxiety - which I feel I have been dealing with following an extended period of the brain burning situation. But for most cases, “Hangxiety” is essentially that exhausted/fatigued/malaise/depleted feeling you experience [lasting hours, to days, to weeks] following an intense episode of anxiety/panic attacks.

I was wondering if anyone else goes through this? I feel like I’ve been hit by a truck - or like one would after recovering from the flu. And truth be told, it almost saddens me that one can experience so much mental and emotional distress, or psychological torture from being sick, to the point that our bodies can be this impacted. 

Its been quite sobering for me. Now I feel invested in taking better care of myself, especially knowing I am prone to somatic symptoms which take my mind to very dark places, imagining the worst. 

Anywho, I just wanted to share my experience to see if anyone else can relate.


TLDR; This week I learned that anxiety/panic attacks can lead to BRAIN BURNING - a stress response that makes one feel as though their brain is on fire; Once the dust settled from there, I felt like I had what people refer to as ‘HANGXIETY’ - my entire soul and body feeling drained and depleted following my body being so inflamed and in survival mode for that long. I never want to feel this powerless again. I want to take better care of my mental health."

I hate my face in general for being ugly, but when I get a pimple there I look like kwasimodo.

I have 2-3 pimples there and I keep putting azelaic acid as prescribed by my doctor but for weeks they dont disappear. They are bumpy and I can feel it (i avoid mirrors even).

I don't know what to do. Once one of them disappears, ANOTHER one comes.

I dont smoke or drink. I have a healthy diet, I only get them on my forehead.

I went to the dermatologist and she prescribed me azelaic acid and another anti-acne product but NO visible effect for like a month.

I stay in my room as much as I can, when I go out I wear a hoodie and I avoid talking to people because I know everyone is staring it and judging me for it.

I can never talk to a woman with these 2 big pimples on my forehead. I feel so self conscious because I know that's what people will stare while I talk and that's why I don't talk, don't meet people, i avoid everyone.

But this cannot continue. It's one thing to avoid mirrors like forever, but another thing to avoid interactions. I need help. Tell me both how to accept this flaw that I'm a freak and what else can I do to stop it - I've been thinking about going to endocrinologist to test all my hormones and tell me what's wrong with me."

Ever since I had a cancer scare beginning of 2022, I’ve been very aware of my health and anything new freaks me out. I found out I had an ovarian cyst in August 2023 and had a CT scan along with bloodwork. Everything on my scan looked good, I just had a cyst on my right ovary which I got removed along with endometriosis in October. I recently got sick (a cold) which then turned into a sinus infection, and had a lymph node grow. Well that freaked me out and I went to the doctors, she wasn’t worried and it went away. I believe I have IBS because I’ve had symptoms of it since childhood, but recently I started getting lower left abdominal pain. It’s kind of like a dull ache/stabby pain but it’s on and off. My bowel movements look normal, no blood, maybe a little constipation but whatever. Then a few days ago I started getting a dull ache where my stomach is… I’ve been trying to let it go but like cancer constantly runs through my brain. Now I am freaking out about colon cancer, or some other cancer that grew in the past couple months…. It’s literally exhausting…. Does anyone deal with this?"

Well, when I´m surrounded by people, for example in the supermarket or even when I go for a walk, I start to feel my self really dizzy on the head. Everything around me become unstable and I have the feeling that I am going to fall or faint ( although it never happens). 

I relate It with my back neck and cervicals but It is just how I feel It. Usually when the dizziness comes I feel my neck loaded and rigid. The worst part is that Im going to class every morning and It hits me really hard everyday. My girlfriend told me that can´t be seen from outside. 

It's been keeping me pretty down lately since I just want to try hard in classes but Im in the roller coaster. Also It happen to me when I go to the barber and I sit in front of those huge mirrors.

198cr5k,Anxiety,2024-01-16,Chronic anxiety and panic for years. Need advice and/or recovery stories.,"F(19)I have no idea how to feel calm. Anxiety is such an odd illness: I do not fear anything in particular; I am honestly anxious about being anxious. Today, I feel extraordinarily hopeless, so if you have any success stories for me to cheer up, please share; I would love to hear those. 

I have been facing severe anxiety since last year. For absolutely no reason. I just feel extreme panic. Therapists say, ""There is always a reason"". But the problem is, I feel like I taught myself to be in this state and cannot relax. My first panic attack happened when I went to see my friend from another country, and anxiety just never left my body since. I didn't even know it was anxiety; I thought there was something wrong with my stomach: I had vertigo and felt like vomiting.( Just to clarify, my friend never caused me to panic: she is loving, and I never felt off around her. You know, it's not like my body gave me a signal; she is still genuinely my best friend! )

It is so odd that I remember how I 'got sick', but the world just changed for me in one moment. Now, I constantly feel tensed; I  want to cry, and I feel breathless all the time. Countless doctors, billions of supplements (btw magnesium somehow gives me nightmares), therapists, meditations....  and nothing worked. I learned to control it to some extent (time truly helps!). However, I do not feel 'normal', I do not feel like myself. 

You know, they say: 'She went crazy'. That's me. I went crazy. I couldn't leave the house; I thought, what if this feeling is an allergy and I will die? What if I am ill with something else, etc... No. I am not ill. I am physically normal to an extent where they can literally send me to space with this level of physical health. But what is up with my mind... I always anticipate anxiety; I panic about feeling anxious. I am scared about being in this state of restlessness forever, as it has been here for 2 years now."" You just have to keep swimming."" Yes, but for how long? I feel like I am not a part of my own life. How do I help myself, I just want to be normal again, I want to be loving to my friends and hang out with them without this impending, disempowering sensation growing in me. How do I get rid of it? Is it possible to stop feeling like this? You know what scared me to bits? My therapist said that if I do not know what I am anxious about, I just need to take meds, and she cannot help me. I felt insane, I literally wanted to cry right there. Is my situation hopeless? 

Please let me know your success stories; I want to read about how people started feeling themselves again after chronic anxiety, what helped, and how long it took them to recover! How do you deal with chronic, unidentifiable stress? How do you release the tension in every muscle and learn to breathe?  Please let me know. I feel like giving up:( 

Thank you so much for reading my post! I am very glad there are people on this planet who can understand me! I wish you the best evening ever.

198cdl4,Anxiety,2024-01-16,I cried at my esthetician appointment,"I'm naturally an emotional/sensitive person, very stressed, anxious individual, have depression from time to time, etc. Anyway, so I went in for my a laser hair removal for my face appointment. It's been 20 sessions (that's quite abnormal). I waited past my appointment time, around 15-20 minutes, still waiting.

Then, the manager of the clinic, who I've only seen a few times here and there says to me, ""Hi \[my name\], nice to see you. Is it okay if our trainer looks at your face since your case is unusual"". She said this in an open area and gave me no context as to why my case is unusual (although I've been having a feeling that it is).

So I get ready in the room, prepared for the laser treatment. It's usually just me and my esthetician, but this time the manager and trainer also looked at my face, critiquing it, saying yeah there's still growth, seems unusual, asking me about my hormones, if I have PCOS, etc. They advised me to get a hormonal test, blood work, urine test, etc., and pushed my appointment for next week. So today I got nothing done.

That was my final bubble. The manager asked me, ""can you come in for next week?"". I was contemplating, could I? I'm dealing with a family emergency, my aunt who is like my second mom, might have stage 4 lung cancer, and my mom and I are going to travel there and stay there for many months (around 2 hours from my house and this clinic). I told her, ""I don't know...I think so..."" and then made the crying ugly face with tears rolling down. The manager didn't know what to do. My esthetician took the manager and trainer out, closed the door, and listened to me. I talked with that ugly cry voice, and then within a few seconds, tried to speak normally and stop crying since it shouldn't happen here. I expressed my built up stress for a minute or so, and apologized, and quickly changed the topic for next steps for me. She told me she knows the feeling as her dad's girlfriend died from cancer, 4 months after finding out. I feel bad for crying. She's not my therapist, I'm not going in for my mental health, etc.

But I guess with the additional waiting, the manager straight up telling me my case is unusual without explanation, inviting the trainer to come in as well, them telling me once again that my case is unusual and there is something wrong (and to get a hormonal test) and then changing my appointment, just added onto my built-up stress and anxiety that is kept bottled up. Regardless, they don't know of my situation and shouldn't have to. I feel like a bitch. :\\"

I’m usually able to deal with my symptoms but recently I’ve been having terrible shortness of breath, especially at night. I’ve been waking up in the middle of the night feeling restless and feeling like I can’t catch my breath, and it then takes me forever to fall back asleep. It’s like a can’t stop focusing on my breathing which makes it so much worse. Does anyone else experience this and do you have any tips of tricks for feeling better when this happens?"

My journey started in childhood, and it got triggered by smoking. Initially misunderstood as possession, I explored religious solutions before finding help from psychologists and psychiatrists. Currently on occasional Xanax and daily 50mg Zoloft, living alone has improved things, but I still feel off and dissociated outside my house. Any similar journeys out there? Looking for tips, lifestyle changes, or routines for grounding myself. Carrying Xanax all the time is becoming a challenge due to forgetfulness. Any advice appreciated! 🌼"

198bd1t,Anxiety,2024-01-16,Panic attacks…help,"My boyfriend I just moved into our home about a month ago, it’s been under A LOT of construction so our living space hasn’t been the best. Last Sunday I experienced my second panic attack it was about 15 mins long, I was able to over come it and go about my day (My first was about a year ago, lasted 15 ish mins and never happened again until now). Through out the week I was doing much better and was barely feeling anxious. Keep in mind that I have not been diagnosed with anxiety. I’ve had light anxiety throughout the years but nothing that’s really worrisome. - come this previous Sunday, I fell asleep at around 10p and woke up at 1a fully panicked. I couldn’t get myself to overcome the panic attack, felt like I was losing my mind. I tried deep breathing and took a walk around the house and nothing seemed to work. I was finally, after 2/3 hours able to calm down and bring myself to sleep. My bf was very supportive through it all. The morning after my panic attack I went to urgent care to get things checked out. They told me all of my numbers were great and that I had nothing to worry about. That made me feel a lot better. I bought some mangnisium and chamomile tea to help sleep but I still woke up three times through the night thinking that I would have a panic attack. I didn’t, but I still felt my heart beat very heavy and woke up tired, a little tight in the chest but a little better.

198b71c,Anxiety,2024-01-16,I FEEL LIKE I AM GOING INSANE,"honestly, i have anxiety ever since i could remember especially dpdr. i am not professionally diagnosed because my parents don't really get it. they think it's all in my head. mind you, i am 18. i had a really bad dpdr episode back in November 2022 which lead to a panic attack in the middle of the night. 

ever since than, i am being hyperaware about everything. after some time i developed this vision issue, i see glitches sort of everywhere, floaters and dots and stars in peripheral vision. after seeing an eye specialist, they told me my eyes are fine but i see blue in distance. idk what it's called but the number is 1 in a eye and 0.5 in a eye. 

fast forward to April 2023, i was managing my anxiety pretty well, i still had dpdr episode, panic attack in between but they were less. but i had this fear of ""what if i go crazy?"" it always manage to scare me. after a panic attack. 

i was going pretty well till two days ago. i started watching this j-drama ""me.hiiragi's homeroom"" it's a psychological thriller and mystery show. after watching 2 episodes that day(before sleeping) i woke up in the middle of the night half sleep and my mind was thinking about that show as if i were a part of it. it was so weird that after i woke up panicking, i couldn't remember what exactly i was thinking. i was so confused, why where i thinking like that. it got me panicked enough to stay sleepless till morning, searching reddit like crazy. 

last was similiar. since i was continuing the show. last night i woke up around 01:57 (i sometimes take ss so that I know I was not dreaming about waking up in the middle of the night) i check the time and went back to sleep, again..my mind was rambling, i couldn't stop it and woke up again in panic (the rambling was happening when i was half asleep, i believe) and when i check the time, it was 02:03. only 6 minutes had past but felt like hour. i panickedly woke my sister crying, she was asking what happened but i couldn't answer at all. i was confused, exactly what was I thinking? it was so odd, i remember that i had this feeling last night..it was not only dpdr but as if i am going to d*e or as if i lost my mind. with all this feeling high, i got this thought..what if i su**de because of it? everything felt so odd i couldn't stop crying. after a while somehow my sister managed me to calm down. but somehow managed to sleep.

and now, i can't seem to get these thoughts out of my head. what if i go insane? can't control myself and end up doing something I should not? what if i s***de? everything gets so overwhelming i don't know what to do."

While crying I had the feeling that it's all my fault.
I even said it to my girlfriend , that I am a complete failure as a person. Something like, in me a part is really broken and needs to be repaired. Also That I am not working hard enough(on me). That it's my fault that I have so much anxiety and that I am not ""rough""/strong enough. That I just shouldn't believe my anxious thoughts. That I ""just"" should accept them more. 

Rationally, I know that it's not my fault. My GAD is a disease therefore not my fault. But it seems like on an different level(maybe emotionally) I still believe it's my fault and blame myself for having an anxiety issue.

I really worked hard in therapy(8 years) to have a better live, but still it comes back with power sometimes. 
And then I start to blame me again.

I really would like to be kind and ""hugging"" to me and my anxietys, but sometimes it feels like, something in me is blocking this.

TLDR:
Do you also blame yourself for having an anxiety disorder? Or did you do it in the past and have somehow overcome it? Or am I a special, very fucked up case 😄?"

I finally went to see my doc about treatment options and beta blockers sounded ideal, being able to take them whenever for quick relief from physical symptoms. But they couldn't prescribe me Propranolol due to it supposedly exacerbating the symptoms from Raynaud's. 

Not really sure what to do - should I just try an antidepressant like Sertraline? I don't really like the idea of being on them, probably due to the stigma, but I don't really know what else to do. And as for lifestyle choices, I regularly exercise, eat a healthy diet and get 8+ hours of sleep per night.

1989h3e,Anxiety,2024-01-16,Zoloft advice needed,"Hi there, I 22f starting taking Zoloft and I  am now on day five. 

I began experiencing typical, expected side effects such as 

Nausea 

Upset stomach 

Lack of sleep 

Changes in appetite etc 

However I began to feel about 10x more depressed and anxious. Not suicidal, just very melancholic and tearful. 

I decided to contact my gp regarding my significant drop in mood and was told to quit taking them immediately (I am due for a review come Monday) 

This surprised me slightly as I believed it can take a few weeks to see actual positive impacts. In truth, I thought I’d be told to try and stick it out for at least another week. 

I am not attempting to question or doubt my doctor, but I just wondered if anyone had similar but kept going and eventually saw good results? 

I’ve never been on these before so I guess I’m just a bit alarmed that I’ve been told to quit them cold Turkey.

Many thanks"
19899ku,Anxiety,2024-01-16,Just got a job I'm stressed out about,"I m(20) just got a job as a line cook and I am really worried about it.

I have always had trouble casually talking to people and have always felt like others have viewed me as an asshole for it. 

It isn't that I don't want to talk to them I just can't think of anything interesting to add to their conversation and would rather remain silent than accidentally say something weird and make them uncomfortable but in turn I make them uncomfortable by being weird and quiet. 

I have no self confidence and I think people know that. Right as I was leaving the man interviewing me called me ""buddy"" and it always feels condescending but I understand since people don't really know what to do when talking to me since I don't really have a personality. (Everyone but my friends have done this to me)

I'm not blaming them for just being themselves I know it's all me but I wish there was a way that I could gain confidence and stop being so pathetic. But every time I've tried things like working out to boost it or trying to talk to others it never improves my situation and I'm afraid that this is just who I am and I will always be like this.

1988kkt,Anxiety,2024-01-16,Calm-Aid (Silexan) is the best natural supplement I’ve yet to find for diminishing anxiety.,"omg just thought i’d post this here bc i feel like it’s the most valuable information i’ve learned through my trial and error of testing various vitamins/supplements for anxiety.

i HIGHLY recommend reading all of the studies that have been done about it’s efficacy and how they’ve even compared its strength to SSRI’s/benzodiazepines yet it remains a much safer option that is over the counter with virtually zero side effects! 

taking this for the past year off and on has helped me so, so much &amp; i’ve never had any side effects as opposed to the SSRI’s and benzo’s i was once prescribed i hated taking because they made me feel like absolute shit all of the time and the withdrawal was awful.

if you have occasional anxiety or chronic i would recommend this so hard — for my, i’d say mild-moderate pretty chronic anxiety, this has turned the dial from a 6/7 to a 2/3 when i take 160mg (2 pills) every day. the effects build too so if you take it and notice you feel less anxious just wait until it’s been a month or so! it’s amazing &amp; i’m very happy with the results. also in case i sound like a spokesperson i am not lol i’m just really into finding more natural ways / medicine to try and help get rid of the anxious feeling. ok that’s all, if you have any questions feel free to comment &amp; once again highly recommend reading into this!! just don’t everyone buy it at once bc i need this stuff all the time and don’t want it sold out. 😂

oh also forgot to add it has been shown to also have anti-depressive effects as well as it can be helpful for regulating sleep too! my fucking godsend tbh"

198860u,Anxiety,2024-01-16,"I had a major panic attack last night over starting college again, and now I feel paralyzed.","I’m a sophomore and basically I’ve had horrible anxiety last semester. I ended up having to go home and start medication and I began to reevaluate living away from home. Ultimately I decided to go back to my school to give it another chance now that I had medication, and frankly, I’ve been feeling much better.

My first day of classes was today. Last night, I was out to dinner and I had a horrible panic attack. It came on so sudden but I knew I started to have racing thoughts. I had all my classic symptoms of a panic attack happening and I was trying to manage it. 

Until… I started getting dizzy. I’ve never had this before. I told my mom. I blacked out after that point, but apparently I was walking to the bathroom slowly, and then I was able to actually pass out but I then leaned forward and hit my head into a wall. Then I became more conscious and I went to the bathroom with help from the staff at the restaurant. 

I’ve never passed out from a panic attack before. It was so scary. 

But now I’m debating on if I should even stay at my school. I drove back home with my mom so I’m not on campus now. I feel so paralyzed. I don’t know what to do at this point. I’m smart, I’m on the deans list, I have good friends at my school. 

I don’t want to leave my school but I’m afraid my body is literally rejecting going there. This panic attack was a wake up call."

The next day, for no apparent reason, I wake up on level 8. Like a buzz going through as if I’m plugged into an outlet. The slightest random thought can cause me to feel like I was thrown into a freezing cold pool and being chased by a bear all at the same time. 

I want things to make sense. I like to figure things out but this, I don’t get it. It’s like the more I search for answers, the worse things get.  I’ve listened to countless YouTube videos, audio books, several therapists, changing my routines and habits. I’ve monitored everything I do to see which variable causes which scenario. Was it what I ate? Was it how I slept? Did I workout? Did I take my supplements? NOTHING seems to make sense. Everything seems like a cruel twist of false hope and I’m right back to square one. 

I’m huge on supplements and natural remedies. 
My questions is this: what have you found that has solved this puzzle for you or is this just a debilitating disorder that is always lurking? What has caused LASTING change? 

Here’s what I take: vitamin D, vitamin B complex, magnesium, fish oil, probiotics, creatine, collagen… I’m contemplating THC gummies and now Theanine. I’ll try anything reasonably safe 

I’ve always worked out my whole life and I’m in good shape. I’ve tried meditating and breathing exercises but it’s like telling someone who is set on fire to just relax 

I wasn’t always this way. After several personal losses in life (people, money, pets), physical injuries, growing older and having children, sadly this is who I’ve become. I’m half ashamed at what I’ve become and half desperate for help. 

I need help. This is exhausting and ruining my quality of life.

In 2023 I went thru the the most stressful time and thought I was gunna die cause the stress lead to a panic attack. Before that I was very active and worked out alot but recently gained about 50 lbs cause I was too scared to even move. Since that day I had my pannick attack ive dealt with a pounding heart that comes with exertion even when sleeping I can feel my heart or even just standing up from a rest position. Just sitting I can feel my pulse where ever there is pressure on my body. I’ve dealt with every other symptom that comes with cardio phobia but heart pounding and chest tightness is my main symptoms that been here from the start. It as gotten better when it comes to walking around and working at my job now less bothersome in intensity of the pounding even none at times. I just recently did a cardiac work up with my cardiologist, blood work and 4 ER visits. They all said every thing is good just some skipped beats but those are  normal and a very slight thickening on a part of my heart but he said that was from stress and being over weight but reassured me it’s not a problem at all and just loose weight. I asked my cardiologist if it’s safe to work out with the pounding sensation and said it’s fine even to push my self over time to prove to my self. There was I time I could run 5 miles, hit the gym  and skate everyday not all in one day but rotate between those now I can’t but willing to push my self because  I have gotten better in all other aspects with health anxiety and cardiophobia just not the pounding that I have yet to conquer.

1987q7u,Anxiety,2024-01-16,The Fear of Self Fulfilling Prophecy and Coincidences,"Hi All,

I have pretty bad Health Anxiety, one of my fears is a Brain Aneurysm (lets call it X! for some reason typing it gives me Anxiety). For some reason even saying the word gives me anxiety! Anyways earlier in the night I had a dream about a double X. and then this morning I was listening to a philosophy video on the concept of Miracles and it was brought up as an example. And then I was listening to a random comedy video about ""your friend who is on epsteins flight list"" so completely unrelated and the guy just randomly said ""Oh no guys look im suffering from X"". Then!!!! my boss calls and after talking about work hes like ""the right side of my face feels like its gonna explode (from maybe sinuses), I am working from home today"". 

I already suffer from icepick headaches that sort of move around (like a specific brief pain somewhere in my head that lasts very briefly) , my doctor seemed to skim past it, mostly because the last time I brought it up it was occuring alongside an episode where I was nervous about my heart (this episode was pretty horrific and long but everything turned out OK! every test I did came back normal except for an abnormal sonogram which showed an enlarged ventricle which was corrected for after I did an MRI with and without contrast.) Maybe unsurprisingly the ""icepick headaches"" that used to be pretty uncommon are now more common after every single thing came back clear for my heart (and even now after everything is clear I will occasionally be like ""am I having a heart attack?""). 

I am super concerned, can anyone who has gone through this reassure me, I might just bite the bullet and get a CT scan or MRI if I have to but I really don't wanna waste the money for something that I know deep down (even if I don't feel it currently) is anxiety. I feel like its an uncommon thing to talk about Im not sure why on two separate instances it happened today, unlike when the same thing happened with a heart attack (way more common event to just bring up randomly)."

The older I got the worse it got. It became so bad that I wasn’t able to leave my own house. I couldn’t go on public transportation, drive cars I just couldn’t leave. From I woke up and anxious till I went to sleep, anxious life, my entire life and day  I lived anxiously. Finally, I decided to talk to my doctor and try a new medication. I had already tried setraline without success, but this time I was put on duloxetine. After a lot of exposure therapy while being on duloxetine I have come such a long way. It has worked wonders for me. I’m now able to live a almost normal life. My anxious feelings are completely gone and my mind is more at ease. It’s been truly amazing.

Even though I don’t feel anxious anymore or experiencing anxiety as I used to I’m now experiencing that my body still feels anxious even though I can’t feel it in my head (I still think the anxiety thoughts but without the anxiety feeling). I get symptoms like disassociation, fatigue, heart racing, sweaty hands, cold sweats, and a feeling of urgency and danger. 

Has anyone else has the same experience where you get all your anxiety symptoms without the anxiety? And how long did it take for it to settle down? I’m currently 4 months on the meds."

2. No, your intrusive thought is not happening now, and now is all you have (the present is gone and the future is not guaranteed). Accept that.

I took it as they thought I was super annoying and were like leave me alone (anxiety am I right) and was kind of worried about it. She was like he just seemed concerned which is nice actually.

And then it hit me, it must be so nice to have that be your default. I've noticed this trend when talking about things with her a lot. She naturally looks for the good and doesn't do what-ifs. I just can't imagine how much simpler life would be if that was my natural way of looking at things. He ended up texting me back after I explained the situation and was like Just glad nothing was wrong so she was right.

19833n3,Anxiety,2024-01-16,What it’s like for me to have anxiety…,"I was just thinking about this yesterday…Right now I’m not in medicated and can tell you exactly how it feels.

To the average person a simple task like getting out of bed going to the car and driving to work would be routine and simple.

To me the person with anxiety, my brain process this to the 20th power taking every single little thing into consideration. 

My brain as/before Getting out of bed: 
- what time should I get up?
- you’re going to be late if you don’t get up now
- you don’t even have clothes prepared
- do you have enough body Wash
- should I eat first before getting in the shower
- you should buy new sheets &amp; blankets
-  I wonder if I’ll be to loud as I’m getting out of bed and wake my wife up
- I bet there’s a killer waiting in the shower
- I feel to comfortable, maybe I should just call in…

My brain Getting in the shower
- waters to cold…Is something wrong with the water heater
- what if slip and fall and break my neck
- I’m probably going to be late to work
- I still don’t know what I’m going to wear
- what should I eat?
- should I eat now before I brush or brush after I eat
- I should’ve played some music before I started my shower
- should I wash my hair today even though I did yesterday?
- etc

My brain while Getting dressed:
- I think drinking tea is making my anxiety worse
- I think this  medicine is making my anxiety worse
- I’m going to be late for work
- I need to hurry up before traffic gets worse
- my clothes are to loose/tight I need go shopping
- these shoes are uncomfortable, I need to go shoe shopping as well
- I need to get a hair cut this weekend
- *nostalgic thought of when I was skinnier *
- I should go to the gym today
- I’m still on the 4th belt hole maybe I’m not more fat
- where’s my black hat? Omg where’s my black hat (that I’m not even going to wear)
- etc

My brain as I eat break fast?

- this tea is taking to long to get hot
- this microwave beep is to loud
- this is going to make me late work
- I need to clean this kitchen…my wife probably thinks I don’t do anything around the house but makes messes. *proceeds to clean the kitchen, living room, do laundry, eat breakfast all while creating more anxiety and panic *
- oh shit I need to hurry and leave to go to work….

My brain while driving to work:
- I’m going to be late
- I’m so happy I bought this car
- weather sucks
- someone’s going to hit me, I know it.
- why the hell is everyone driving so fast?
- why is this person driving so slow?
- I bet the person behind me is pissed because I’m not driving fast enough
- I’m probably going to ran off the road by this semi
- etc

Arrives at work:
*no one cares if I’m late or early *


This is my brain 24/7 with every interaction and with every single task I perform. It is non-stop worrying. Non-stop thinking."
1982riv,Anxiety,2024-01-16,I had an extreme and rare (for me) case of anticipatory anxiety,"I have a permanent dissociative disorder for over 7 years now, I feel completely detached and cut off from my world etc. I have been doing EMDR weekly since about June last year, and just now switching to fortnightly due to finances, wanting to save some money.  
  
The other day something weird happened. I went to a cashier desk to pay for something, it was just one young woman serving who looked a similar age to me, and while I was waiting I got a hugeee surge of anxiety, adrenaline, started to literally visibly shake and I was just trying my best to focus on breathing and try not to look too fuc\*ed up.  
  
I'm not like afraid to talk to people, or women. I know some people are, but some days I'll be fine, others like this situation, it just seems very out of my control, I'm instantly hit with this feeling of anxiety so strong it's like I just got jabbed with a needle of adrenaline. It's been a long time since I felt it this intensely. I don't know the person, probabaly never seen her before in my life.  
  
Anyway, I'm driven to do anything it takes to recover from the dissociation, and I tell myself I will do anything that scares me in life. Still, I get no reward or feel better, but I still persist. I still stayed and paid for the item I ordered etc. But it was that bad I seriously wanted to just go.  
  
This is not normal for me. Well, I've had it happen a few times since EMDR. And maybe a handful of times during these 7 years dissociated, but because I feel so spaced out, the only benefit has been that I get no anxiety at all. I have heard this sort of thing is good though, and it's a sign the EMDR is working? Or that I'm progressing through the heirarchy of the fight/flight/freeze triangle etc, like dissociation and freeze are at the top, most severe states etc, and feeling things like this are in the zone of fight/flight etc.  
  
But I still feel as dissociated as ever. I don't care about things being a good sign if I feel anxious again now and then, If I am never going to return to reality and atleast come out of the dissociation for a bit after 7 long years of it being 24/7. I feel like I do all the right things, I push myself and do things I previously avoided, I do therapy, I am very active and healthy, I have several productive hobbies, even though the dissociation severely impacts them. (I play guitar, but not feeling present in my body whilst playing complicated things, and looking down and wondering how I'm playing these things, and then making it feel worse etc)  
  
Is there anything you can advise, or help me with please? Thank you"

1982kws,Anxiety,2024-01-16,Anxiety Disorder and Upcoming wedding,"Hello all,

I have an anxiety disorder. The main problem is being ""trapped"" somewhere, in a very litteral sense : if I cannot got out of a place or situation I loose control.

Random Exemples : movie theatre were a big problem until I realise I could go out and sit next to an exit. Plane is quite difficult. Car : I hate going in if I don't know if the driver is okay to stop if asked (even if I never ask, just need to know I can).  
Another exemple : church is difficult : you cannot go out whenever you want, it is very rude.

Well, I am getting married in a few months. I am very very happy, but I am terrified of the moment (and only this moment) when I have to go in the church and walk in front of everyone, everyone looking at me. That is not a situation I can ""escape"" without extreme drama. This moment \*has\* to happen.

This is so stupid I know. I know that as soon as I am seated next to my future husband on the front row, I will be fine and happy. 

But this moment, thinking about it paralyse me.

I want to fight this, fight has always been my weapon again anxiety : when I couldn't even take the subway I forced myself to take it for one station, then the next day again and the next day perhaps two ? The movie theatre : i seat my self more and more away from the exist just to tell my brain ""see ? you CAN survive this ! ""

But in this case I don't know how to prove to my brain that everything will be all right on the Big Day, walking down the isle. I tried going to church and seating in the front rows but felt no real anxiety.

Any one has advice to how prepare myself for that moment? how to train my brain to not panick in this situation? Anyone has been in a similar situation?

I know of the respiration exercises, I have anxiety pills in case of emergency (but I am not sure of their power against a full crisis).

I want to add : I have been in therapy (not anymore) and doing much better, most of the situation that triggered a crisis are mostly gone. I have discovered a lot of activities I forbade myself and enjoy it very much ! So I know there is hope that I \*can\* do it.

Thank you, all.

I am sorry, english is not my main language."
1982e74,Anxiety,2024-01-16,I'm losing myself,"I'm 20, I moved to a new city because of college last year. I didn't have a place to stay for a year so my mom asked her friend if I can stay at his place while he is gone, I moved in, and in the meantime she got pregnant with him. My life kinda turned around with that but it was always messy with her I will not go in further details but basically my childhood was not that nice, abusive father who died few years ago so it was basically just me and my mom the whole time. This new guy of hers is just an asshole. Anything I say is denied, if I need help its denied, all of my feelings are denied from his and now her side, any help I need is denied they won't help me because they think its unnecessary. Guy has a lot of money so many is not an issue, Im mentioning this because they've built a new apartment for them and I live in his old apartment which has no heating, no bedroom, I'm sleeping on a couch  for a year now and a half and everything is filled with his stuff they forbid me to basically change anything in there and its infested with fleas for months, they won't help me because they believe everything will go away on its own, even tho I have two cats but it was infested before the cats, cats just triggered them more, and they won't help me to get rid of the fleas, I can't do that on my own because its not my apartment. Im trying to study to get into law School, but that's not possible with them, now they plan to renovate everything and I will basically have nowhere to sleep. I am tired because every mess that happened in my life is not caused by me its caused by them or just her and they don't realize it, she just drags me into her life I kinda don't want to be part of, everyone I talk to about this they say im being dramatic, I never deny anyones feelings and I don't like when that happens to me.

19814bm,Anxiety,2024-01-16,Anxiety attacks and work,"My agoraphobia started during COVID and ever since I feel like I was hit by a car and needed to slowly rehabilitate myself. I have made some progress with going to therapy and talking to a psychiatrist, but I’m still in the thick of it. 

All of this to say, I applied for a job opportunity that my friend told me about and the work is right up my alley. She works from home and mentioned that the job training would be in person for two weeks. I can survive a certain amount of time outside so I didn’t mind. But I didn’t listen to her carefully enough and I realized too late that it becomes a remote position after 90 days. I cannot survive that long. My panic attacks happen randomly sometimes but also happen if I get an upset stomach which led me to my agoraphobia. I get all sorts of physical symptoms that look scary from the outside (I shake uncontrollably, repeat phrases/unresponsive, look like I’m about to faint). I just can’t act like this on the clock because I need to talk and shutting down is far from ideal.

I have the job interview tomorrow and I’m pulling an all nighter just worried about it. I want to ask if I can work remote sooner, but I don’t want to come off as demanding. Should I try asking for it as an accommodation? I want to express to them that I’m willing to put in the hard work and time, but the problem is the place from which I do that. I want this job and it’ll be my first one. Im trying so hard to fix my anxiety but I need money and I don’t have time anymore for me to be capable to handle being outside and being in person yet.

I am proud of the strides I have made with my anxiety in my everyday life but I still have limitations... a big one for me is working.

I also have chronic pain so it's hard (and other mental health issues besides anxiety), and started working at 19 (I am 21 now), and certain jobs I just CANNOT work.. not out of laziness or entitlement (no problem whatsoever with entry level jobs in general), but jobs like retail, fast food, and customer facing jobs with people in my face (think receptionist) - eat me ALIVE (the only way I would consider a job like that where I would have to sacrifice my mental health to that extent is if I was homeless or had a family or something of that sort).

I have had 3 jobs so far and the longest one so far was for 4 almost 5 months working remotely doing IT Support, tried food service for less than 2 days and got made fun of and told I sucked at the job basically because I couldn't keep up (ADHD) and became mute from my anxiety, and I worked at a call center remotely for 2 weeks but the guy I worked with drove me to insanity basically.

It also doesn't help that the area I live in totally sucks.. career wise I am going to school to major in Information Technology with a Concentration in Software Development (was going to school for Cybersecurity but the work seemed too anxiety inducing being on call 24/7), and the only jobs I can really work (at least for right now), are remote jobs or jobs that are very lowkey like libraries, stocking, data entry (although there are like no data entry jobs near me or online), or phone/computer work, basically jobs that only have you do tasks and aren't customer/people focused.. 

I still wrestle with guilt that I just can't go up and work a more ""normal"", ""social"", job, but I know it will eat me alive and overwhelm me if it's too much.. and I cannot go on disability because I'd have to live with my parents forever and it would be too limiting for me in a lot of ways.. but I still struggle with feeling guilt over what I can/cannot do.

Any thoughts? Thanks.

1980cea,Anxiety,2024-01-16,Advice on quitting my job due to anxiety?,"I have a good job, the job is not the issue, my anxiety is. I'm 31F and had anxiety, agoraphobia and depression since I was 14. I overcame it to get a really good career and in the last 8 years or so I've worked in a decent job and earning just above average wage. I work from home for a good company and I have no complaints. 

In the last two years I've gone through multiple traumatic losses and my anxiety has crept back up on me horrifically. I am now in a position where I struggle to leave the house or interact with any strangers day to day. Most days its an effort showering and looking after myself. My BP is through the roof and my resting heart rate is over 100. I'm riddled with physical symptoms of panic every day. I feel like I'm killing myself slowly. I'm in therapy and recently started on medication but it's a long road ahead and I've been there before...

I've been off work now for 3 months and due to go back soon. Problem is I don't feel capable of doing any job right now never mind mine. My job is very social and high level and the fact that I struggle to even shower seems laughable how I could do my job. 

I've spoken to my partner and he supports me taking a year off but it would cost me about a quarter of my savings I've built for us to buy a house in near future. That dream would go out the window for a few years but I'm at a loss. I just want a few months where nothing is expected of me except to just get better, just feel better and feel happiness again, feel stable and feel like me. No work, no projects, no meetings, no expectations. But I've got a great job objectively speaking, good money and if I let it go am I just causing myself more stress in the long run of being unemployed and possibly unemployable? Will my anxiety just fester and get worse? I feel lost and any insight from anyone who has done this would be appreciated."

I was shaking like crazy, couldn't breath en feld like my bloodpressure was getting so low I would die. I felt so scared that I've called an ambulance (not America so not to costly).

Since then I was prescribed Oxezepam 10mg, for when I needed it. I am pretty scared to take it so I only took half pills. In the last 2,5 weeks I took 10 times 5mg oxazepam. Now I've stopped taking it for 2 days and I feel absuletly crazy. Almost non stop panic attacks.

I hardly ever drink anymore. Maybe like once every few months or so. 
And I got a bottle of rosé to drink for my bday. 

I wasn’t paying attention because it was passed midnight and when I’m on my computer I just drink what’s infront of me so I just kept drinking till the whole bottle was gone. 

I got hammered for the first time in my entire life. 

Now the main thing, I have severe panic attacks where I can’t breathe and convinced i’m dying. Now, ever since the 15th when I drank I’ve been feeling awful. Almost throw up but didn’t. I was still drunk for a while. 

I know that drinking alcohol can give you a faster heart rate etc. but I was wondering when I’ll be okay again? 

I’m better where I’m not drunk anymore, I’m able to eat and drink fluids and everything. Not nauseas. Really just a headache and fast heart rate. 

I’m so fricken worried that I messed up my heart and I’m gonna die in my sleep."

So I (17) got prescribed Lexapro today for my anxiety
I’ve had a pretty shit life overall, never had any friends for years, was always abused at home, was super isolated and bullied my entire life,had a bad ED, etc etc

Now I went to a psychiatrist today who agreed that Lexapro is the best option for me considering I can’t function with my anxiety anymore. However my father is dead against it. 

He believes that I will become addicted to it and that it doesn’t solve my problems. Like yeah, true, the medication won’t make him less of a dick to me, but at least I won’t be having panic attacks everyday and will actually be able to focus in school so I could get into college and then out of this hell hole. 

I paid for the meds myself (which costed me a ton btw) and he hid them while I was away at school. Apparently he called some of his “friends” who told him that medications have bad side effects like “increasing suicidal tendencies”. Like, dude, I already have those and I’m not even on medication yet 

But yeah, it’s frustrating as hell considering I was looking forward to taking them today but now I’ll probably just get worse and can’t afford to pay for my next appointment and next batch of medication rn. I looked all around the house but he probably threw them away so 🤷‍♀️"

I just get so damn anxious, and then I tend to avoid things...and even binge on food I don't even want.

Also, I'm trying to give myself credit for experience I have. I have an extra course or two from the school I transferred from that involve lab dissections, grant proposal practice, tissue cultures, and cell counting and imaging!

That 2nd week of mono I started getting horrible panic attacks to the point of 185 heart rate thinking I was actually going to die. Since then I have been getting horrible sleep, whenever I do fall asleep it’s only for a couple hours and I also started getting panic attacks right before I went to bed which made it hard to sleep. 

I don’t really get panic attacks before I go to bed anymore it’s more just my heart is racing, can’t keep my eyes closed, can’t get to sleep until 5am or later plus now I even have issues sleeping at other people’s houses. I tried staying the night at my cousins house and was up till 8am so ended up going home since I couldn’t sleep. 

Now flash forward, 2 days ago I was sick again I think with food poising. Threw up 10 times every hour. Tried sleeping woke up just to throw up again. Now the sleep anxiety is even worse and I feel like even more shit from being bloated and not being able to eat like I was. 

I just don’t know what’s going on with my body. I mean i’ve been feeling like shit almost every day for the past couple years but it was never an actual sickness it was just a stomachache and a headache normally. Also now my anxiety is way worse than ever before.

If anybody has some advice please share with me cuz all of this is getting really exhausting."

first time posting here, please be nice!

i’ve always been afraid something bad will happen to my loves ones…
a few years ago, i lost my grandma and it was one of the hardest things ever for me. lately, a lot of changes have been happening: my sister moving out, me sleeping at my boyfriend’s every night. my getting a full time job. because of this, i see my family way less than i used to and i hate it.

lately i’ve been very aware that my parents are reaching a certain age (57). my only grandpa, my sister and my dog are also aging. every holiday i think: “what if this is their last one?”
i keep hearing people around me getting diagnosed with illnesses, people’s loved one’s dying and this makes me so scared that i will lose my loved ones too. what if my parents pass away before i can fulfill their dream of being grandparents?

i keep thinking about how everything used to be in the past and how simple it was…

is it normal to think like this? i guess it is, but to what extent?
is there any way to change these thoughts into something positive?

thank you for reading!"
197wsit,Anxiety,2024-01-16,don’t know why i freak out about this,"okay so about 8 months ago i went to my friends birthday party in his dorm with a lot of my friends (on a dry campus where no substances are allowed) and long story short there was weed and alcohol and we got busted by campus security.

only details needed are that i had wanted to leave for a while because anxiety around breaking the rules (it wasn’t super bad at the time) and also the other important detail is that me, my best friend, and my boyfriend were the only completely sober people there. there was around maybe 7?+ other people who were all pretty messed up.

they had to search their entire dorm, keep our phones while they did it, and all that stuff. i mean it’s fair we broke the rules. but here’s where the bad stuff comes in:

i had the WORST panic attack of my life for some reason. it was so bad they were threatening to call the ambulance on me, i was hyperventilating to a point of concern, unable to speak, etc. i cant rly describe how bad it was but any of my friends could tell you it was bad.

okay so the part i need advice on:

even tho i literally just got a warning and basically didn’t get in trouble at all i have had a MASSIVE fear of campus security and RA’s ever since. I do not have anything that’s not allowed on campus and i don’t break the rules anymore. it’s been a long time and the fear is still there and it almost feels like more of a physical reaction than mental.

example: they did room checks and i was shaking rly violently even tho i KNEW i had nothing that was against the rules

example 2: if i’m driving on campus and see campus security i immediately start to think somethings wrong when it’s not (like thinking my headlights are off when they’re on or thinking im speeding when im not)

i am planning on moving off campus because it had gotten so bad. it has been affecting my everyday life and i have nightmares all the time about it

my question is why am i still so anxious even though i did not get in trouble and i am not doing anything wrong? i tell myself it’s fine but i can’t help but panic.

(if it helps i struggle a lot with paranoia related to ptsd, but that is not from this incident bc this wasn’t traumatic that’s from unrelated stuff when i was younger) 

any advice would be amazing thank you :)))"

197vkxh,Anxiety,2024-01-16,I feel like an idiot,"Whenever something bad happens to me I feel like a complete fool and that I don’t know what I’m doing. When I make a mistake or do something that pisses someone off and I realize it, the situation plays in my head over and over again and I can’t get over it.

For example, I was on the train and I was basically taking up two seats because there were two guys in front of me who were pretty tall and I didn’t want to accidentally step on their legs. I had the mindset that someone who wants to sit down would ask me and I would gladly stand up and let them take a seat but I realize now that 1, I’m breaching transit etiquette by taking up a whole seat in the first place, and 2 people just don’t feel comfortable asking. I put my own comfort first before others on PUBLIC transit and I just feel like an idiot because people around me probably thought I was an asshole putting myself before others. This guy even yelled at me to nudge over and I just stood up offering the seat because I was feeling anxious at the time and didn’t know what to do in the moment. This lady tried to make me feel better but I ended up getting off the train and started sobbing even though the whole situation wasn’t really a big deal. Normally I would be able to deal with the situation and be like “Oh yeah no problem sorry” but I don’t know why I just started breaking down. 

I haven’t been to my classes for the past week because I’m so afraid of getting on the train and making the same mistake and getting yelled at and judged again. This goes for the same when driving, when I make some mistakes I get really anxious and the situation plays over and over again and it makes me not want to drive.

I really wish I wasn’t so paranoid and so prone to overthinking things especially when it’s a small situation. Any advice on how I can avoid these replays of bad situations and to move forward? I wanna tell myself that it’s okay and everybody makes mistakes but it’s really not helping me."

Will my doctor get sus is it too early to refill?


I also wanna ask him to upp my dose I moved from 4mg diazepam to 0.25mg Xanax but I want 0.5mg Xanax (the max they script here)

0.5mg works perfect feel normal no side affects still a bit weak but oh well I shake for a little while but I can pull it together 

I feel like I’m asking for too much?

But anyways will my doc get sus

 I don’t abuse it but have history of addiction but honestly ITS WEAK ASF 0.5mg is perfect 0.25mg is just not enough 




Context as well, I’ve take 15mg diazepam it just made drowsey when I would take 4mg it used to make me super drowsey and didn’t help anxiety but I was too scared to ask for a dose increase

197u5yk,Anxiety,2024-01-16,How to get anxiety meds without triggering anxiety,"Hi! I'm a senior in college and I'm about to go into my student teaching. I've been in therapy for a couple of years for my anxiety, but I've had it as long as I remember. A couple years ago, I got some medication for it but it didn't do anything and I felt bad that my parents (and their insurance) were being charged consistently just for me to tell the doctor that it wasn't working and him prescribe me a new one. I tried both sertraline and lexapro.
Eventually my friend persuaded me that I shouldn't be taking meds if they aren't helping so I went cold turkey on my lexapro (had absolutely zero side effects) and just tried to make my life easier instead to help with with my anxiety. 

Now I'm staring down allll the things that were most panic inducing and I feel like I need help. My therapist suggested I try again. I have a part time job so I can pay for my own medical bills and therapy, but I don't want to pay $200+ every GP visit because I know it will take awhile to find the right fit for me. My parents are so nice and always want to pay for my health problems but they have their own finances to worry about and they aren't the biggest believers in anxiety. 

Should I go to the health center on campus and hope that they take me seriously (I go to a church related school), or go back to the previous doctor, or find a new one? Again I dont mind paying, I just can't afford to blow a bunch of money because my doctor realizes he makes more the more often I come in."

I spoke with a psychiatrist today and told her my horrifying experiance with celexa. I also have a long term clonazepam prescription that my GP gives me. Ny GP has no plans to take me off Clonazepam because a 30 day script last me about 9 moths on average. 

My psychiatrist suggested trintellix to try, I researched it alot on the internet and was surprised to see there was really a low side effect profile with the most being bad nausea for some people.

It is mainly for depression but has been used for anxiety with great success. I didn't see anything about agoriohobia so I was wondering if people have had any experiance with it in that way. 

My agoriphobia is very mild at this point I would say but I feel it trying to make a jump and I want to stay ahead of it.

- it is not tightness
- it is not pain
- my heart rate is or goes back to normal
- similar feeling in chest to what you feel in stomach before public speaking.

So basically I feel the same feeling that I already felt many times in my stomach, but I feel it in my chest…?!  I am really scared is this a heart problem or just anxiety?"

Eventually with therapy as well, it helped me overcome it and I was able to function normally.

But now in late December 2023/January; my chest started hurting again and I’ve hardly been eating, and my panic feels like it’s back full force and I can’t handle it. What’s the point of going on if anxiety can just come back and make you feel like you’re dying again. 

Obviously I won’t do anything, I know (deep down) I can overcome this but it’s just so pain and aggravating, that even after hard work you can have moments where it’s so bad. 

I guess I just need supportive words and to know that someone else out there also has low moments like these."

197rktc,Anxiety,2024-01-16,I’ve been on SSRI’s on and off for 5 years and I’m ready to find a better fix to my anxiety,"Like the title says I’ve been on SSRI’s since I was 16. I am now 21 so it’s been nearly 5 years. The first medication I took was Zoloft which seemed to help at first, but eventually it made me completely numb to every emotion. That, in turn, led to some pretty extreme “speedy” drug use for around nine months to a year fluently, every day. During that time I quit Zoloft cold turkey and eventually got completely sober from the drugs due to the obvious issues speed causes along with what seems to be anger issues and some kind of mood switch that happens with no warning. After this became too much to handle I went back to the therapist that helped me get through my anxiety the first go-round, and was eventually prescribed Lexapro. It helped for a while and I stopped therapy again. This time I didn’t turn to drugs but avidly smoke marijuana and drink alcohol. My anxiety is not as extreme as it was in the past when I was doing drugs, but I have made less progress than the last time I was in this same situation. I am unable to drive myself anywhere without either having a passenger with me for comfort or drinking alcohol. I use to love taking long cruises alone and (soberly) almost all day. I want this luxury back. My anxiety is holding me back from doing everything I love.

currently i’m on 60mg of cymbalta and 30mg of buspirone daily.  i’ve taken this cocktail for over 2 years, and until now, it’s the most stable i’ve ever been. i was seeing a psychiatrist at the time, but i can’t get an appointment with her for weeks. 

if i were to go to urgent care, is there anything that they’d give me to help? i am not an addict, and i dont want to be so drugged out i cant drive or work (i live alone and have to care for myself of course) but the physical symptoms of my anxiety are making my life living hell. i know that urgent cares are very weird about what they will prescribe people, so i dont want to waste my time and money if they’re just going to tell me “lower your stress and take a deep breath”. im doing the breathing exercises, trying to take walks when i have energy, and attempting to be social when i can. i cant find any relief."

This besides the end of 11th grade is probably the worst year I feel so left behind and out of it. All my friends are growing up and applying to colleges and I still feel like a child I never did things cause I was afraid of wasting time because that I never improved. It was so stupidBut when I was in freshman year my mom said something to me that made me I don't know break. I ended up thinking that I wasn't going to make it in the world because I was too stupid and that I need it to make the most of my life now because it probably wasn't going anywhere after high school. Live off of the fun times and stuff like that it was like the world was ending. Now here I am a senior struggling with spending time on things that might not work out right struggling to know where to put my time in I end up doing something easier like wishing that I had the power in the will to do something about it. All the while I have these friends that are so passionate and motivated and aren't afraid of that And I'm just stuck in this stupid bubble scared and by myself I don't know what to do.

I don't know I really hate how my feelings can get all  Screwed up randomly. I really wish I could just feel okay to be proud of myself but It makes me feel anxious cut myself some slack then  I'll cut too much and I'll get yelled at. If I just let something go and stop punishing myself with it and there's a chance that I didn't learn my lesson and I'll end up making the same mistakes over and over again I don't know what to do about it honestly.

My mother told me that she thinks I should try CBD for my anxiety, since I’ve already unsuccessfully tried a couple SSRIs with side effects too severe or disruptive to continue them. At first I was against it, but I’ve been getting more and more desperate to get some relief from my terrible anxiety, especially since I have college work and classes that I need to be focusing on, so I’m now seriously considering it.

So I was wondering what your guys’ experience with CBD has been like, for those of you that have tried it. And I’d also like to know a good and reputable place to get some*

During my most recent one I texted my mom and she sent me this. I tried it and it significantly calmed down me down and made me able to function again within a few minutes. You will feel funny at first when doing it but it’s such a relief. I wanted to share it with anyone who isn’t familiar and struggles with panic attacks like I do. It’s definitely worth a try.


The Hemi-Hookup:

1. Cross left ankle over right.
2. Extend both arms in front of you, hands back-to-back, thumbs pointing down.
3. Cross right hand over left at wrist, interlock the fingers and clasp the hands together.
4. Roll your interlocked hands down and back in towards your body.
5. Rest interlocked hands comfortably on your chest.
6. Rest the tongue softly on the roof of the mouth behind the front teeth.
7. Inhale slowly by nose and exhale by mouth.
8. Hold this pose, gently, and continue slow, deep breathing for 3 to 5 minutes (or as long as is comfortable)."

I got a message from the person next door asking me to be quiet as she was tired and the walls were thin(she asked in a nicer way then I put here). I replied saying sorry and that I’ll keep in mind in future. I then just stuck to a soft voice while playing and went off shortly after. This is the first time anything has been said about it and I know I’m in the wrong with it but my head has now got me worried that like it’s going to pass around the flat and that I’ll be disliked by everyone so I didn’t know what to do and started feeling sick and hot from the worry so I just wanted to get it out here just so it can help it pass. Just wanted to get this out though as have nobody to speak to about this stuff so this feels better then wallowing in it in solo.

I had an appointment today with my doctor at 5 pm and spent the entire day in a panic. Heart palpitations, sweaty hands, dizzy, feet and legs go numb, I lost my shit on my husband for no reason. Doctor says there’s nothing wrong with me. At least not with my pancreas or gallbladder but he’s going to send me for an ultrasound just in case to settle my mind. Now the pain is gone.

197oeg5,Anxiety,2024-01-16,Only just realised what I thought was normal is actually anxiety?,"Ok, so a bit of backstory. In November I went to see my GP after years of mental health struggles and I  began taking Sertraline. I had to fill out a few questionnaires about depression and anxiety, and the results came back as having moderate for both.

This surprised me because I never really thought of myself as an anxious person, I'm outgoing and loud and I do not care in the slightest about talking to strangers or waiters or the like. I couldn't have anxiety, right? I think my idea of anxiety was likely based on Social anxiety, and also on someone as nervous, shy, reserved, and with clear visible symptoms like panic attacks.

Since then, I've been really trying to think about my behaviour and thought processes and I have realised that there are actually several things which are indications of generalised anxiety that I was convinced were just normal, regular things. Thoughts that were fleeting, so not important enough to mention to others, and therefore no one knew. 

I want to know if anyone else shares similar thoughts. One example is whenever I am on a tube or underground train, and it stops in a tunnel, EVERY SINGLE TIME without fail, my mind immediately jumps to 'what if there's another train coming that is going to crash into us and the carriages get crumpled and we all die'. I have to reassure myself that its fine and nothing is going to happen, but every time I still hold my breath just in case. The thing is, the train the moves, I get off, go on with my day, and its as if I've never had such an extreme thought.

The same applies to a fear about 2 seater cars, where I believe that if the car falls into a body of water, the passengers in the back would be unable to escape since they have no door or window of their own, and 'surely the front passengers would have passed out from the impact'. I mean, what? Why am I thinking about this literally ever time I see a car like this, and planning my escape route if I ever happen to ride in one. 

Not to mention worrying about the house being on fire every time I turn onto my street after a day out. 

I've also only just realised that when I speak to people I'm mostly preoccupied with what I'm doing with my eyes, where I'm looking, and if I'm making too much or too little eye contact.

I feel like a bit of a fraud because I don't really have the outward symptoms of anxiety and its mostly in my head. Does anyone else have feelings like this? Why is this happening? I'm on the waiting list for therapy so I will have to discuss all of this then, but for now its just confusing..."

I love the car, I love the idea of driving, but I HATE hate hate the idea of the test. I would be able to do it if I wasn’t being directly watched? Or if my mom or maybe my dog could come with me. Definitely if my dog could come with me, but he’s not a PSD. 

I don’t want to fail. I know I’m gonna Sike myself out and I’m gonna screw up because of my nerves. And I always THINK my anxiety is getting better but when I’m actually IN the anxiety provoking situation, no matter how much I prepared for it, I have a panic attack. Usually I just break down crying because I’m completely overstimulated, overwhelmed and panicked. What do I do? How do I get through a test with a stranger next to me and no emotional/psychological support? I know if I fail I’m never gonna take the test again. What happens then? How do I deal with the fact that I know they’re judging my movements and decisions? That’s a MAJOR trigger for me. And how do I deal with DMV chaos? I know they get crazy and they’re really slow, I’m not set up for that, man. 

I feel screwed. I know the second I get there I’m gonna start panicking, and I know as soon as I get in the car, I’m gonna cry like I’m a toddler. I’m gonna embarrass myself one way or another. I don’t want to do this, but I want to drive so i can have a little freedom. I just need some help.

However, every since I won - I’ve been constantly weighed down by this feeling of dread something bad is going to happen to “even it out” the only time I can escape this is when I’m distracted

With Yemen, Israel, and Ukraine all under fire, it's pretty clear we have 3 potential flashpoints, with two of them being large scale conflicts with all-out war, while the third one can potentially drag 10 different nations into another war in the Middle East.

While I try not to doomscrool and keep my media intake to the absolute minimum, hearing the MoDs of Germany, Estonia, Sweden and other countries state that war with Russia is a real possibility within this decade doesn't really put me at east either. Why I don't really care much for journalists and their opinions, these warnings come straight from the people who'd be waging such a hypothetical war.

I had been struggling with mild anxiety (yet managable) my entire life. I never really understood why I was anxious but I have sense figured it out. Around a month ago (finals week) I was drinking upwards of 3 bang energy drinks DAILY as well as 6 shots of espresso nearly every morning (excessive and dangerous yes I know) After staying up for 24 hours and then going to college the next day I came home and felt extreme shortness of breath, I couldn't breathe, thought my heart was going to fall out of my chest, my. body was tingling, I was sweating and as pale as a ghost (kept feeling like I was going to pass out). Well this was my first panic attack and I thought I was dying.. I made my dad come home from work and rush me to the hospital.. I really thought I was going to die. The hospital ran every possible test on me and concluded it was a panic attack. After then I had multiple panic attacks a day for around 2 weeks. (possibly prolonged anxiety attacks that lasted a full day). I had upped my Zoloft from 50 to 75 during this period and my doctor gave me sleeping pills which caused me to go into serotonin syndrome (made my anxiety worse).  I thought about ending my life during this period, I have always been a happy person and I have loved life but I had. no control over my mind, actions OR body and it made me feel completely hopeless.. Thankfully this all has been happening since on Christmas break because otherwise I would've had to drop out of college. After 2 weeks of dealing with unbearable chronic pain, mental breakdowns and just feeling horrible about myself I decided to start attending CBT therapy which has seriously helped me, and I have my 4th appointment this Friday. I went back to my regular dose of medication and also discovered that I have ADHD... I was put on medication for that and it has tremendously helped my anxiety as well.. (even though at times it can make it worse). My anxiety has significantly imporved and even though I am still feeling some lasting effects from the initial attack I feel much better.. I began meditating as well through the ""waking up"" app 2 days ago and I already feel a tad bit better (HIGHLY recommend meditation!) Getting yourself in a schedule may be hard but it does help. Surrounding yourself with people who understand you also help. Now, I do not feel the same as I did but part of living is changing and I know I will never be the person I was but I have greatly improved and I don't really want to go back to who I was. I have became more empathic, understanding of others and myself. Please don't give up, there is a light at the end of the tunnel and this is all temporary, it will not go away on its own but the day you decide to change and work for a better life that is when it gets better. I am wishing you all the best. Also cut down on screen time and spend more time with friends/family. Peace and Love. "
197nt57,Anxiety,2024-01-15,Just another help me post,"Hey! 👋🏼 

M, 33, 211lb

Long story short, long time anxiety ridden person, diagnosis of Generalized Anxiety circa 2016.

Been having chest pain for over a month. Don’t worry, I went to the doc weeks ago and was diagnosed with Gerd. They did a EKG while I was there and said everything was normal.

Now, with it being almost 30 days since that appointment, 1) I can rule out anything life threatening, 2) my medicine for Gerd has had no affect? 

What should I ask my doctor next? I don’t want the chest pain, and if it was attributed to GERD, I would think I the medicine would have made some impact by now."

However, I've noticed that I have to plan my day around when it wears off, especially if I'm doing something that'll get my heart rate up (walking, being out, wtc). So I have some questions for anyone who switched from IR to ER, or just takes ER in general;

1. Did the ER have any different side effects, or was switching fairly seamless

2. With the ER, do you just take one and are good until your next dose the next day, or does it peak after like 12 hours

3. What time do you take it?

4. How has the Extended release been treating ya?

Thanks!"

197medp,Anxiety,2024-01-15,Job hunt struggles and procrastination induced by anxiety,"Hi everyone. This will be a long one because I've been bottling a lot of things, so I just wanted to thank everyone who takes their time to read this, and if you have any advice, I also appreciate you deeply for responding.

I'm not very used to using reddit to be honest, so I'm not sure if there is a way to add more then one flair in this subreddit, but I belive this post is both an ""advice needed"" and ""venting"".

A while back, I planned on writing a huge chunk of text here when I was feeling really bad about a lot of things that were happening in my life (or should I say not happening), but then things got too personal and I opted not to post it. The thing is, my overall mood improved, and I became more productive, except in one crucial aspect of my life. Work. Despite my daily promises to job hunt, procrastination takes over every time.

I remember there was a certain day where I decided I was gonna look for work at 4 pm, and literally did NOTHING for the rest of the day. Now-a-days I'm back to the miserable state of feeling useless. Job hunting is frustrating, especially when you don't even think you'll ever get a call back from the places you are applying to. I acknowledge feeling this way is worse, yet I'm struggling to overcome it, I just don't know how to change it.

I've improved my sleep schedule, started eating healthier, talked to more people (at least online...), started meditating, and even started learning a new language. However, job hunting remains an endless source of anxiety and escapism. Recently, rhere have been a few instances where I've actually started looking for a job, but then my heart started racing A LOT and I ended up not doing much. What frustrates me the most is my lack of trust in anyone to talk about it and I currently have no money for therapy. It took me a long time to even find courage to post this as I'm really not used to sharing my feelings in any way shape or form.

It seems like, subconsciously, I've already given up on life and don't believe I have a cure. I feel like I'm constantly wasting time and, given my current state, I'm getting more scared of my anxiety completely taking over my life to the point where there is no return. I even find it hard to get out of my house sometimes, even if I want to. I also can't help but compare myself to others. Sometimes I question myself if this ""state"" I'm in can even be considered living.

I also find it very amusing how, despite spending an absurd amout of time browsing through Youtube or something like that, when I consider doing something a bit more productive yet still entertaining, like watching a movie or creating a video I'll think to myself ""I can't do that now. I still haven't searched for a job today"". If I'm not gonna do anything either, why does my brain resists engaging in something slightly more productive?

At the end of the day, I guess what I'm trying to say is that I'm scared, and I don't know what to do. Once again, if you have any advice on how I can stop this cycle of feeling bad about myself without doing anything or just feel like sharing your experiences, I appreciate you taking the time to respond.

I really wished I could end this post with a hopeful tone, the best I can think of is that as I've been thinking about posting this for a LONG time, there is at least on less thing I'm procrastination on :)"

197m67o,Anxiety,2024-01-15,dropping out of college again,"TW!! mention of suicidal thoughts and hopelessness 

honestly just looking for people who can relate. I ended up trying to go back to school for a third time a few days ago but it went horribly AGAIN. i got to my apartment and set everything up and my anxiety kicked in worse than ever (i had already been anxious the weeks prior to moving in but it somehow managed to get so so bad). i reached a point with the anxiety that i just couldn’t live with it anymore and didn’t know how i was meant to survive life when EVERYTHING was making me anxious: the thought of leaving the apt, the thought of going to class, assignments that hadn’t even been assigned yet, having to get my own groceries, doing laundry, literally everything. and this happens everytime i try and go back to school, it ends with me becoming suicidal. i just feel so broken and like such a failure for not being able to get through smth everyone around me is enjoying doing. i see my friends moving forward with their lives, graduating, etc. and i can barely make it through most days unless i’m doing absolutely nothing.

i’m either going to be trying TMS or ketamine to see if that can help manage my severe anxiety and depression, but i’m terrified about what comes next if even those don’t work. I’ve tried a plethora of medication and combinations of them, and nothing quite works. my symptoms also have only been getting worse over the past few years so i just feel so hopeless with life.

i’m so fortunate my parents are able to financially support me rn, but they can’t do that forever, and idk how im going to get anywhere in life when im afraid of everything to the point of suicidality. 

anyways if anyone can relate or wants to share their experience, it would be nice to not feel so alone."

I have a lot of fears like fear of planes, small spaces, elevators etc. I also have 2 therapists. But over the years, my anxiety became worse and worse, and I can’t even travel without having ‘unreal’ feeling or feeling that I’m gonna faint. Right now I’m on mountain with my best friend and my mom, since I was a kid I loved skiing and I was really excited to go on this trip…but I can’t because of this constant fear that i have and panic attacks. It’s really embarassing to have those panic attack episodes In front of my best friend even tho we know each other for 12 years already. My mom really worrys about my mental health because of these episodes. I really wish my anxiety would just go away, because whenever I have panic attack i ruin my mom’s day. It’s really hard to deal with it, when I have this unreal feeling i can’t eat, move, talk, nothing…I’m frozen because of fear.

197ljcz,Anxiety,2024-01-15,Anxiety about work constantly,"I am a professional 50 year old accomplished woman.  I work as an IT Director and have always done well.  Lately I’ve had extreme anxiety about work.  I don’t want to look at emails for fear there is something I’ll read that will trigger me.  On weekends I can’t relax without thinking I should be working.   I have an extreme fear of failure or doing something wrong.  My anxiety about work is almost like when a pop star says they have stage fright. How can that be ? All I know is that if I’m not working all the time, I am stressing about not working.   I can’t take vacation because it makes me even more stressed out.  I know none of this is rational and I do things like exercise daily, eat healthy, have hobbies, be with my kids.   Maybe because it’s just me who has to shoulder the bills for everything I have ? I have 2 daughters and I’m not married but their dad is involved a lot.  Idk.  I’ve tried anti-anxiety meds but they don’t work.  I’ve eliminated alcohol because it gives me relief for awhile but then afterwards it fuels the anxiety even more.  My work environment is challenging and complex.  It’s demanding in every way.  I need the job and I’m doing extremely well, but the self-doubt and anxiety are consuming my life to where I can’t enjoy anything.  Anyone else like this?

197k7yu,Anxiety,2024-01-15,Anxiety at dentist,"Sorry this is very long, skip to the end if you want. I don't have clinical anxiety or whatever it's called but I feel really anxious going to the dentist. I find check ups uncomfortable but bearable and I always go because I know it's important, anything else makes me very nervous. 


My teeth are really weak for some reason even though I brush twice a day and floss when I can so dental work is inevitable and from what my dentist has been saying it's any day now. I think I became nervous after my first filling. They didn't use anaesthetic because they didn't need to drill. They didn't explain things or warn me about the different sensations which I think is what has made me feel so nervous ever since. The second time I had the injections which weren't bad but my heart rate got so high and I was numb for like 4 hours afterwards. They didn't warn me about the heart rate. It's not the needle I'm afraid of, it's the lack of communication and lack of control and the inevitability of my teeth failing soon no matter what I do and my previous dentist who did both those fillings was very heavy handed. I think I might need another filling, I've got a checkup Wednesday and I'm so nervous if I do need a filling. If I need it I'll still go to the filling appointment but I really don't want to feel so extremely uncomfortable like I have in the past because it's going to make my chronic illnesses flare up badly.

 
I don't think my dentist knows I'm nervous because I hide it well. I don't know how to tell them without offending because I truly do hate the dentist but it's not a personal thing, it's dental work itself and I know they can't avoid that much. I also don't want to be treated like a child because that's just weird and it's far too obvious that they're trying to distract me. I hate the sensations so much. I'm fine with other healthcare professionals, it's just dentists that make me feel really uncomfortable. Especially when the room my dentist uses seems to also be used as a staff room during appointments? Like, how unprofessional is that? Doesn't reassure me at all.


I know nitrous oxide is an option but I'm more scared of that than I am the actual dental work 😅 so maybe not the best option. I don't know if my dentist offers it, maybe I could ask to try it beforehand because I think that would make me feel more comfortable. I need to feel in complete control over my body wherever possible and I'm worried the nitrous oxide would inhibit that.


TL:DR what does nitrous oxide sedation feel like? 
How much does it cost on the NHS in the UK?
Is there anything else that helps you feel more comfortable?
How do you tell your dentist you feel nervous?"

197jg7l,Anxiety,2024-01-15,I think I might drop out of school,"This is a bit long, but please read.

In college, I began working at a place in a position that did not need a degree. I networked really well and participate within my work and local community a lot. I'm a hard worker and pretty proud of what I've done these last few years. Once I graduated college they moved me right into a position that would last until my one year grad program was complete (so I was doing school and work at the same time). I thought it would have worked because I was successful in my undergrad years doing virtually the same things, however, I messed up. One course I didn't do any work for (it was completely online), another course I did all the work for but never submitted the final assignment even though it was done and the other two courses I completed easily.

This past semester was also a time where I had to prepare for my job's certification, but I stopped looking at my school's email because I was feeling so overwhelmed. Now, I was basically promised my dream job because of my work performance, they just don't know about my school performance.

I fell so behind in everything that I just became avoidant of everything, to the point I am ignoring professors' texts and emails because I can't bear the embarrassment of the conversation. I feel so rude, immature and irresponsible that I think I may have to drop out of the program and inform my job, who have gone through hoops for me. I don't know what to do. Can someone offer some words of advice? I'm a wreck."
197jdfp,Anxiety,2024-01-15,nausea from anxiety,"Ever since I was a young child I have been struggling with feeling lightheaded or nauseous because of what I believe to be anxiety. This feeling used to be a huge issue for me when I was going to school and missed so many days because I thought I was sick, I went to so many doctors growing up and they never knew what was wrong with me. After I finished school feeling like this came seldom until recently, for context I have become extremely stressed and withdrawn due to my current living situation and events happening in my life. Because of what I think is me just being anxious, pretty much consistently, all day, everyday I have been feeling extremely nauseous. I have tried almost everything over the years and like I said I don’t believe I am physically ill in any way but the only thing that has ever helped is me making myself throw up. If anyone has struggled with this and found a way to truly soothe yourself anytime this problem arises, please let me know as this has taken a toll on my daily activities as well."
197jbof,Anxiety,2024-01-15,"New Doctor Took Me Off Cymbalta, Put Onto Mirtazapine","I'm really glad he did overall, but like with Cymbalta and previously Welbutrin and prior to that Lexapro, Mirtazapine also has it's issues. I've started to get my paranoia back. I'm at an age and point in my life now though that I can manage it much better. The Mirtazapine helped with my depression a lot. It made me feel happier and more motivated overall. I'm also on Adderall for ADHD. 

Like  most people, I've also had bad sexual side effects. In fact, part of the reason I went from Lexapro to Welbutrin was due to having problems getting erect, and then having trouble staying erect loll. But Welbutrin gave me such bad anxiety and cramps in my stomach that we went to Cymbalta next. The weird thing here is after a few months, I was getting stronger erections than I ever had before. But I couldn't maintain. So, my most recent doc took me off Cymbalta and onto Mirtazapine. I lost the sort of 'god complex' feeling I had when on Cymbalta and felt that someone had taken off a veil from my brain. I was able to think way more clearly now that I've been on Mirtazapine. But now, I'm finding that I can't even get full erections anymore. It's been about 2 months that I've been on this, and my libido has only moderately improved. I'm wondering if it'll take it's time like with Cymbalta. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm just so exhausted of this process though...the past 3 years I've truly not felt like myself, and feel that I lost most of my drive and spent one of the past few years doing absolutely nothing aside from working and maybe exercising here and there. Does anyone have similar experiences? I'm wondering if I should stick with Mirtazapine or try something else?"
197j7mj,Anxiety,2024-01-15,how do I cope,"Sorry for my English, it's not my first language and I'm quite unnerved right now

I had a lot of health anxiety since I was a child - I widely remember being scared I'm about to die and praying because my nail polish had chipped and I thought I swallowed it when I was 8. Accidentally swallowing glass, heart attack, breast cancer because my breasts felt weird, most recently a tumor I had completely made up and after I calmed down I couldn't find a trace of.

The worst of it - my teeth

I have braces for 3 years at this point and ironically didn't give my teeth enough care - just normal brushing, never flossing and worst of all smoking cigarettes on and off (I don't anymore)

I witnessed a family member loosing their front tooth out of a sudden and I thought it didn't affect me - now I think it somehow deeply did and I can't stop thinking about it. Even if someone tells me that teeth don't fall out over nothing I can't believe it because I saw it!

I have anxiety attacks obsessing over it, feeling like one of my teeth is about to break/fall out, different one every time . I can't sleep or think about anything else until it passes - usually after an hour or two, but it lasted a whole night one time.

I probably have a cavity on my bottom tooth ans even though it's not a big deal, finding it in a bathroom of McDonald's made me upset for 3 hours , almost crying, checking it out every 5 minutes in the mirror and suddenly feeling like my whole cheek is swollen

The real question is - how do I cope? I plan on getting help but I'm not in a financial place to do it rn.  I hope everyone has a good day"
197j07y,Anxiety,2024-01-15,"Neck constriction and tightness, hormones? Anxiety?","Hi! A few months ago I went through an event that I think was triggered by a hormone imbalance. It made me feel very sick (nausea, shaking spells, dizziness) and seemed to align with my cycles. One particular week I randomly got a headache and a bunch of fluid in my ears. One of my ears seemed to be infected and spread into the side of my face, down my neck, and out to my shoulders and upper back. I felt horribly sick with vertigo and like I was going to faint. No doctor could see an infection though. I finally begged one for some antibiotics, and right around then the “infection” started receding.

I got on bc to settle down my hormones and have had bloodwork and head/neck scans all that show nothing. Many EKGs from ERs that were also perfect. I’m still dealing with these neck constrictions and tightness, almost like I’m being choked. Lots of chest and upper back achiness too. I’ve been seeing my PT and chiro. There seems to be a disc compression issue as well, because certain sensations will be affected by my position. 

I am starting to narrow all this down to migraine, anxiety and a disc problem all under constant inflammation but good god it’s been stressing me out. I stretch and do light yoga but working out as I normally did seems to tighten my back and neck muscles. Has anyone had experiences with hormones and/or anxiety manifesting in such a physical way? I feel like my life has been put on hold, as I can only be active for parts of the day. How do I get through this?"
197iwc7,Anxiety,2024-01-15,"9 Months with Health Anxiety, BFS experience and tips that helped","Hello everyone!  
  
I'd like to share a bit of my experience with these symptoms that started nine months ago.  
  
In short my symptoms were fasciculations all over my body (mainly on the legs and arms), body tremors, dizzyness, floaters, pins/needles on certain positions and meralgia paresthetica on the right leg. I never lost muscle strength or weight  
  
I confess that I turned to the internet to search for my symptoms and fell into the rabbit hole that some of us have experienced. I feared I had a severe neurological disease. From that point on, my symptoms worsened due to stress and sleepless nights caused by anxiety. I spent my days in constant panic, testing my body's strength. My main fear still is MS due to all the symptoms.  
  
According to the doctor, I was suffering from anxiety, accumulated fatigue, and all my symptoms pointed to BFS (Benign Fasciculation Syndrome). Serious diseases typically don't start this way, and I could rest assured. They advised me to relax in life, as my body was signaling anxiety and accumulated stress, and to return the next year. They explained that our bodies accumulate stress and anxiety, and each person reacts differently.  
  
Currently, I only experience fasciculations on highly stressful days, but they are very mild and sporadic. I hardly notice them. I occasionally have stressed days and health anxiety. I still have floaters and meralgia paresthetica on the right leg when i´m standing up for too long.  
  
To conclude, I'd like to share some suggestions/ways that helped reduce my symptoms:  
  
\- Get proper sleep (this helped reduce spasms by half; get a digital watch if it helps you measure sleep phases or how long you sleep, but don't use it if it causes more anxiety).  
  
\- Trust your doctors (if you've seen a doctor and they've told you everything is fine, accept that as your diagnosis; don't get caught in the pessimism spiral again).  
  
\- Avoid searching online for symptoms.  
  
\- Exercise (it helps release stress and rebuilds trust in your body; I had no symptoms on gym days).  
  
\- Reduce coffee and sugary stimulant consumption (quitting coffee and sweets helped reduce symptoms; I noticed symptoms worsened when I had coffee).  
  
\- Identify triggers for your symptoms and how to control them (one of my triggers was work-related stress, and I'm currently trying to change and develop strategies to reduce stress).  
  
\- Engage in activities you enjoy (read a book, play video games, watch a series, listen to music, travel...; I realized that when I had my brain occupied with enjoyable tasks, I hardly remembered my symptoms, and they even reduced).  
  
\- Meditate (I'm not sure if this suggestion works for everyone, but it helped me; I tried meditating for 5 minutes a day in the evening, and I feel it helped reduce symptoms. I still meditate on tougher days).  
  
\- Talk about your symptoms with someone you trust (discussing the matter with others greatly helped me feel secure again).  
  
\- Accept the symptoms you have (one of the most challenging processes; after weeks of tremors and spasms with no serious symptoms, I began to deal with it with some disdain and even humor. Some days, I jokingly told my wife that only my butt trembled that day, and the next day, it would be my lip. The sooner we realize that our symptoms are harmless, the sooner our subconscious starts to realize the same).  
  
I apologize for the lengthy post, but I wanted to share my story with all the details and a message of hope for everyone.  
  
I don't know what the future holds for me, but I strive to live one day at a time, without dwelling on major concerns about my symptoms.  
  
Enjoy life and above all trust your doctor if they've told you everything is fine. Our minds have strange ways of communicating that something isn't right, but it doesn't necessarily mean its something very bad."
197iijk,Anxiety,2024-01-15,Anxiety over savings,"Hi, 

I’m 35 years old and lately I’ve been having anxiety about my savings as far as how to allocate my money in the best way possible. When I ask for advice from friends and family I get tons of different answers which gives me more anxiety because they’re different answers. I don’t really make enough to hire a financial advisor though. I contribute to my 401k up to the match and I plan on maxing out my Roth IRA and I have a car loan at 6.49% interest rate and my plan I think is going to use my property tax refund every August to pay more towards my car loan. How do you handle the anxiety of not only spending your savings to better yourself financially but also coming up with a good plan as well? 

Thanks"

I got my heart tested in January and July of last year,  everything seemed good.   I got blood work in October and there was nothing to be concerned about.

Why do I have heart pain??   Is it anxiety???

197ia5f,Anxiety,2024-01-15,I am struggling with HA so bad,"long post so I do apologise, I've been brain dumping how I feel. I've been suffering severe anxiety since about April last year. I'm really struggling at the moment with how I feel and physical symptoms. I started in a downward spiral last year where I convinced myself I had ovarian cancer, paid for scans privately etc. I then went on some antibiotics which I stupidly read up can give you nerve damage! I didn't have any of the side effects but still paid to see a neurologist who said I was ok. I even went to a&amp;e as I thought I was having a stroke, turns out it was a panic attack. It started in my left side &amp; has now travelled to my right hand side. I'm struggling so bad with the obsessive thoughts &amp; physical symptoms. my head is going round and round convincing me I have nerve damage &amp; constantly trying to tell me that's the problem. I am struggling to sleep because of all the anxiety, can't concentrate at work and am not enjoying anything anymore. I feel like an empty shell of myself, I have no enjoyment anymore at all. I'm in therapy, we've tried CBT &amp; EMDR and it's just not helping at all. my symptoms are headaches, neck ache, tingling &amp; tight muscles in my legs/feet. I take no medication apart from Kalms as I am scared of side effects. I feel so alone in how I feel. I'm supposed to be getting married this year too &amp; feel like a failure to my fiance. During the Christmas break my feet and legs didn't hurt for 4 days straight as I was occupied with seeing family/friends."
197hpcw,Anxiety,2024-01-15,Looking to discuss my dizziness and anxiety!,"Hi all, I'm a 27 YO male (former college athlete of non contact sport) who has been dealing with what I believe to be some symptoms of anxiety. Over the last 5 years, off an on, I have been having feelings of dizziness (not exactly spinning, but certainly a type of dizziness), facial pain (pressure around my nose, forehead, and sinuses generally), and more recently some panic that comes about when I get very dizzy, which prompts me to get nervous and causes the panic.   
  
The interesting part is that over the last several years, I have had years at a time where I feel good and don't have these symptoms. Then 7 months ago, I started getting dizzy again and then havn't been able to get rid of the symptoms.   
  
It's headache-ish pain, but I would really describe it more as facial pressure that is relatively aggressive around the sinuses. usually accompanied with the dizzy feeling.   
  
I have found that when I travel to foreign places or am out with a large number of people, the symptoms get worse, and there has been a little bit of panic mixed into these situations. When I go home and have time to collect myself, breathe and relax, I feel better (not symptom free but certainly less panicked and more stable).   
  
I have been worked up by a number of specialists including cardiology, neurology, and ENT. I was diagnosed with POTS (failed the tilt table test) but these symptoms are unlikely to be POTS related. my blood preassure / heart rate no longer show true symtpoms of POTS, either. I had an MRI of my brain, CT of my sinus, and ears checked. all normal. all blood tests normal too.  
  
My psychiatrist, internal medicine, and neurologist all agreed to put me on low dose beta blocker and low dose lexapro. Lexapro has helped a bit but symptoms still persist. One other thought I have is TMJ, but unsure if I am presenting with the right symptoms.   
  
Wondering if anyone would like to discuss after hearing my background. Hopefully I can get this under control soon. Thank you!"

I get hunger pangs and my stomach rumbling. I am eating a lot to try and stop this but it doesn’t really go. I’ve been having tests done and the doctor can’t find anything, so thinks it might be anxiety/stress. Has anyone else ever had this?

197h1ia,Anxiety,2024-01-15,Quit vaping/nicotine/snus 29 days ago and still feeling very anxious in situations I usually wouldn’t.,"(22 M) I recently gave up nicotine after 3 years of fairly heavy use at university. I found that my anxiety levels have shot up since stopping and cause me to be anxious in situations I would never usually be. I have read that the route cause of anxiety in most is a dopamine deficiency, this would make sense with the fact that it takes 3 months for your dopamine receptors to be upregulated after quitting nicotine.

I was just wondering if any others had similar experiences and how long it took for them to feel better."

197g44h,Anxiety,2024-01-15,(tw maybe?) anxiety about going outside..?,"I had a total mental breakdown in december and got admitted to the psych ward, but left after 2 weeks to spend christmas with my family and because i felt it was making me feel worse in some ways.. then my brother started screaming at me on christmas and storming off… obviously this didnt help my mental state. im staying with my parents for now and have a therapist, but im just feeling so anxious about,well, everything!! i feel scared about the outside world and public transport and just really everything and its making me feel like im actually going crazy. im so scared im actually going insane. idk what to do, literally everything outside of my parents home is freaking me out."
197g11p,Anxiety,2024-01-15,"I feel intense regret because I engaged in negative conversation about a person. And for some reason my brain makes me feel like they are copying me or I am copying them if they have the same interests as me. This is new to me, I never used to be like that :(","After the holidays two of my sisters met up for the first time in a long time, I was there because at the time I was staying at one of their houses for Christmas time. 

Anyway my two family members, they are my sisters. One I am close to, the other not, due to past things I have felt I can't trust her either. But I wanted to let go so I opened up more to her... And my intuition set off lol, I regretted it. Luckily I didn't tell her too much, just a few feelings about my mom (my mom is mentally ill and extremely addicted to smoking and it has had its affects on me, but I also understand she needs support and kindness and not judgmental ness.) I am since going to go back to basically keeping a distance because I feel like anything I say she will twist it to paint me as bad because sadly, that's what they used to do and I've realised they just don't like me. 

Anyway due to putting up with the two toxic siblings I feel like it has made their toxicity rub off on me?? 🙂 For instance lately I will feel like I'm either copying people or ill feel like they will think I'm copying them, and the other way around, something as silly as this, I love flowers and I told my sister I like them and then after she was talking and said ""you know me, I love flowers"" I was going to say me too, bcus I also had an urge to sort of prove myself? It is so not me. It's like I have become almost competitive? I felt like she only said that bcus I said it and maybe she is being competitive. And in turn it made me feel a certain way... For one, I've always loved flowers, even on my social media's you'll find flower posts from years ago, but because she said this, sometimes when I post flowers or like them I will think of her and think she might think I'm copying her... Gosh what is this!?! Does anyone know. I hate this. This is not me
:( what happened to me! There is another thing, I wanted to get my belly pierced a few years ago but couldn't due to not being able to afford it. Then last year the toxic sibling I mentioned first, got hers done and we bumped into each other at the time so she asked me do I want mine done and I was so excited and going to, but then I started to feel like she'll think i copied her, or she'll say that, or she will say I only got it bcus of her. I never used to actually think that way! And I know thought of that bcus I know my sister is probably that way, she probably really would say or think that. Yet since then, I have become this way. I hate it. I know myself, I know I always wanted to have mine done but can't afford it, and I know I also love flowers and stuff yet because of them two mentioning it it's like they tainted it all and now if I think of it I think of them. I hate it... I think it's also due to me just wanting my own things. I don't know. Oh and also because I don't really like them... Which I know is petty. I haven't always been this way :( I am 18, it's only started happening this year. I need to fix it! And i know many people love flowers, who doesn't! Yet why does my brain do this 🙂🙃 I hope that can be fixed, I just miss my old self! :/

Okay now onto the point of this post, so when my two siblings gathered, they were speaking of the ""toxic"" sibling, and sometimes I joined in. I would include things I heard her say, and now I regret it because as bad as that sibling could be, even though she gossiped, and probably still does gossip about me, I don't think she deserves that and maybe my thoughts are just an assumption. 

I then just said that's why you have to be careful with her etc. - usually I just see this as talking about my feelings, but because the sibling I am not so close with was there, I regret it now. This sibling isn't genuine towards me and I used to find out she'd talk about me and in any disagreements she'd never be on my side or hear me out. She's also very judgmental of others. 

I didn't say much about the toxic sibling, but I still regret it because I'm not the type to run other people down. And I feel like that's what I did. Sure I can share my feelings but how I did it with that other sibling and her husband who also hasn't been genuine towards me makes me feel uncomfortable because they'll think I'm as bad as them basically and talk badly of others. I really was just sharing my feelings and thoughts but I should not have. And I don't want to be doing that with people who also talk about me behind my back, I knew they did in the past but 8 let it go and have been trying to move on and forgive people but I can tell they haven't changed and I feel like also cutting them off maybe. Ugh. 

I think I am just caring too much about what they think, because I know myself and stuff, I also know my intention wasn't to be bitchy and talk badly of someone I was just telling them something about her but I should not have... The things they said about her, they probably say about me too, behind my back. I don't know why I can be so naive sometimes. I am too soft sometimes. Anyway 8 feel like keeping these judgmental, quiete negative at times, people in my life has rotted me in some way and I want to be free of it. It has genuinely caused some changes in me lol. Now I regret not just cutting them out years ago. But maybe all of this will help me in the end and teach me things?

As for the feeling like they'll think I'm copying or vice versa, I don't know what to think or do to fix that :( I think it all started because the toxic sibling lived with me and I realised just how negative she can be. She really is the type to accuse someone of copying her :/ and I think her mindset rubbed off me in a way, so now I sometimes feel if I get my belly done she'll say I copied her etc etc. Ugh.

 And then as for the flower thing, that's with my other sibling who isn't genuine, I've always liked flowers lol and it shows and the people most close to me know that, yet I keep feeling like she'll think I'm copying ugh. But I was at her house and I brought some of my clothes etc, she would have seen all the floral designs... So maybe she wouldn't think I'm copying her just bcus she said once she likes them. I think it just also made me feel that way bcus I told her I like flowers and another thing, then later in the day she said the same. I hate how my thinking has gone :( if it was anyone else I'd like that they like similar to me... 

Please be understanding and gentle anyone who comments, I know it may seem all over the place, I am 18 and these two siblings are older than me but they have caused me pain and stress for years. I barely responded and kept quiet bcus I wanted no drama and now it has all affected me in a few ways. I decided to give one a chance and cut the other out, but due to a few things I've been wanting to maybe cut them both out. And the other sibling is fine and we've been OK. 

Posting here because maybe part of this is due to anxiety? I saw a similar post regarding the copying thing and someone posted it in anxiety."
197fvdm,Anxiety,2024-01-15,Anticipation Anxiety?,"Hi guys! I've been a long time lurker on this sub and it has helped me make some improvements with how I manage my anxieties. But I still struggle with managing my anxiety in the lead up to activities that do increase my level of anxiety and I wanted to know if anyone else experiences it and if they're able to manage it.

For me, roughly 12-16 hours before doing something that would be anxiety inducing to me (driving lessons, job interviews, phone calls, some social situations, etc), anxiety sets in and in some cases I just can't do anything else until the thing I'm waiting for has arrived. It affects my sleep, makes me feel very nauseous, makes me feel tired, makes my heartbeat very noticeable in my chest, and in some cases lightheaded/dizzy and trembly. And that builds up to just before I'm doing whatever it is. But then as soon as I'm doing whatever it is, the anxious feeling dissipates. Obviously, it's still there to some degree, but nowhere near the severity it is during the build up to an activity. I know that whatever activity it is won't be as bad as I'm trying to make it out to be, but I still struggle to manage it.

So I just wanted to know if anyone can relate to that and if they can share anything they've done to manage it so I can least live my life a bit more, rather than being incapacitated for so long? Thank you in advance for anything! :)"
197fn75,Anxiety,2024-01-15,Spinning myself out over a potential gas leak- anyone have advice?,"Hi! I moved into a place with a gas oven several months ago. The past week I've noticed the oven has started to smell significantly worse whenever I use it. To me it smells like gas (vaguely like gasoline/lighter fluid). The smell is worse whenever I open the door and permeates my studio apartment and lingers while I cook and after. I bought a gas detector that went berserk when I opened my oven door after turning it on.

The gas company came and tested the oven with a handheld monitor and didn't find a gas leak. They also turned on the burner and had me smell the gas from the stovetop which smell different than the odor I've smelled.

What could the odor be? It gives me a headache and it's really starting to freak me out."

197fdzv,Anxiety,2024-01-15,Fear of hantavirus in heating ducts,"My partner and I live in an old mobile home in Washington and have caught 3 mice since we moved in about 2 years ago. Most recently, a deer mouse about a week ago. Yesterday when we were cleaning I saw mouse poop in a couple of the heating duct floors vents. We vacuumed it out - and then I read about hantavirus. At first I was freaking out because we vacuumed, but now I am even more worried about how long the poop was in the heating ducts for, how much more is in there that we can't even see, and how to keep mice out. It's very cold and snowy so I can't go out and fix any holes on the exterior. I'm going to plug the only known interior hole (behind the stove) today. We have snap traps set. I'm calling an HVAC technician today to see if they can professionally clean the ducts and see if there are any holes in the system. In the meantime, I'm terrified that the air in my house is killing me. I can't afford a hotel (already trying to figure out how I'm going to pay for HVAC care), have no friends to stay with, can't drive anywhere because of the snow, and I can't turn the air flow off because my dog and my pipes will freeze. Just in case I don't already have hantavirus from the vacuuming or living who knows how long with mouse poop in the air system. How do I stop myself from being afraid to breathe in my own home?"
197fazv,Anxiety,2024-01-15,"My experience with dp/dr,OCD and panic attacks","
So I (23/M)had my first experience with dp/dr in Nov 2020. One night I was smoking weed and had a very bad panic attack. The next day I wake up and I have full blown dp/dr. It was my first experience with the disorder and I was terrified. After a few weeks I figured out what it was and also found this sub. I have never been a regular weed smoker before that ,(must have smoked 5-6 times) but after this I decided to quit and stopped smoking weed completely. I realised it is not for me.
  
Then I started working on recovery. I didn’t consult any doctor but just read things online and watched videos and read posts of others who have recovered and decided to follow them. And symptoms started to fade and almost 5-6 months after, I almost recovered fully from this. It was around march- april 2021. 

Around May my next nightmare began - OCD. I have always had ocd from childhood (like around from 13-14) itself. But it was mostly mild and I have never noticed it to be OCD.But around from May 2021, I got my full blown OCD. My first theme was HOCD , which lasted almost a full year. During that time I learned a lot about these disorders and how to treat them. But I didn’t consult any doctor. I learned how to cope with it with time, but was not properly medically treated.

After almost a year , my ocd started shifting themes to TOCD, which was not as severe as the first time. This was around mid 2022. This was mild compared to my first theme and it didnt affect me much.

From mid 2022 to oct-nov 2023 I was mostly free of all these disorders , yes I had some OCD but it was mild. Then around oct nov 2023 my ocd started to shift to schiz-ocd. Since the beginning of my mental health struggles I have had fear of becoming schizophrenic, and when my ocd started, I used to even worry of getting schiz-ocd, but it started to develop as a theme only around oct-nov 2023. But as I had experience with OCD, I was able to manage symptoms to an extent.So I had it mildly till December 2023. 

Then on December 16 2023, at night, I had a full blown panic attack out of nowhere. It lasted almost 2-3 hrs and the next day I wake with heavy dp/dr. I have been living with that for the last month. It has been very bad. The derealisation is the worst. I would have random thoughts like what if all this is a dream and I would have a panic attack. It is almost panic disorder now. Also I think because of my ocd, I am unable to shake away these stupid intrusive  thoughts like what if this all a dream etc and it gives me terrible anxiety. Anyway I have decided to go to a doctor. I have two questions:

1. Anyone here with similar experiences and how has your journey been? How much progress have you made?

2. 1. Im from a 3rd world country and mental health care is stigmatised here and not so readily available(reason why I haven’t gone to a doctor yet). Also I am not sure how good the doctors here are. So whom should i consult a psychiatrist or psychologist? And what should be the specific specialisations to look for?"

I was clean for a year, but I got a stupid panic attack because of a chest pain - and the aftermath of that stays up until now.  


Right now my head hurts. I'm dizzy, if I'm not dizzy my head hurts, if my head doesn't hurt, my chest hurts, if my chest doesn't hurt my head hurts... I can barely go to school or just DO ANYTHING at this point.  


I have psychologist appointments, but talk therapy once every 2 weeks doesn't seem to help...  


I'm not even convinced I'll be able to go to sleep or even stay alive until the next day.  


I want to cry, even though it will make my anxiety worse (More nasal congestion = headache)  


I don't feel like I have control over it, even though I survived 3 anxiety episodes, I feel like this one is the worst one so far.  


And as I said, IDK what to do anymore... I'm 18 and everybody's enjoying life and all, but now I'm out there thinking I'm gonna die soon.  


I endured so much pain that I don't even feel like I'm strong enough to get through this.  


Meditation works just for, idk 10 minutes. Then all the symptoms just come back, I literally can't stop the negative self talk and overthinking.  


I don't know what even my anxiety is. I don't even feel worried about anything - it's just the symptoms.  


I just wish they would end someday, and I just want to be assured everything will be alright..."
197epzv,Anxiety,2024-01-15,Has anyone here ever felt what healthy anxiety feels like?,"I can't remember what healthy anxiety feels like, if I ever experienced it in the first place. I've always dealt with agonizing anxiety, I was put in therapy at a young age (around 6) and saw multiple therapists off and on till I had a consistent one at 14. I'm still in therapy, but with a different therapist.

It was bad to the point in middle school that at age 11, I was put on Ativan. I'm currently prescribed Valium for my anxiety rn. My doctor put me on Vraylar and it's starting to put a dent of relief, but it's barely noticeable, imo. My partner tells me I'm not going into full on panic as much since I've been on it.

Anyways, do any of you guys remember what healthy anxiety feels like?"

I keep overthinking something that didn't really bother me much before. I'm suddenly feeling like we're not compatible because we don't have as many conversations as we should (According to who? Idk honestly) This didn't give me anxiety before, we could just sit in eachothers company in silence and be happy (we had conversations and connected of course, just not as much as we can just be content with eachothers company). This anxiety and overthinking is ruining and chance we have at even having a conversation because I'm thinking we have nothing to talk about it means we shouldn't get married. We are so aligned with pretty much everything else and I love him so much and he loves me. We can be as weird as possible with eachother and not feel judged, and tell eachothers our darkest fears but this one little thing is nagging at me saying it means we need to break up. Im bordering ocd at the point. I don't want to break up it would crush us both (I cry and get worse anxiety when i think about us breaking up) but I can't get rid of this feeling and idk what to do. I keep thinking if I didn't have the physical symptoms the thoughts wouldn't bother me at all but they go hand in hand obviously. I plan on starting therapy because of this. 

What bugs me the most is I wanted nothing more than to get married but now that I'm engaged I'm just anxious. 

This is mostly me letting out my thoughts. But any advice is appreciated."

I've had him since 2019 and he's never liked ne always angry and boxing and no matter what I did he never liked me.

He HATES being picked up but sometime I have no choice since I don't want the other hunky to be attacked.


Randelle 
Such a sweet bunny I've had for 2 years I think longer and he always gave kisses to me and while he did bite he was such a sweet bunny and curled me and followed me . Now he's all sad and stuck in cage with Bullseye and I find pieces of fur from buckeyes getting scared and bitting randelle becuse if it . I don't know what to do my family members are keen on keeping them there and I really wanna have separate chaos for them and also I'm starting to think of them like my children?. I didn't have a very good family life and the fox I'm thinking of myself as these bunnies caretakers makes me constantly worried that I'm failing them and giving them a horrible  Childhood like I God. It makes me feel like  I'm trapped And I'm making these bunnies feel like How I did In my childhood. That's really bad and my already  Not so good mental health And it doesn't help that  Funnies for me are hard to bond with because they don't show you much affection.

197cvf7,Anxiety,2024-01-15,Sour Candy (Warheads) Help!,"Hey everyone. 
30M, long-time diagnosed Health Anxiety, OCD. 

Recently, my therapist suggested that I try to keep a bag of, or use, sour candy (Warheads) whenever an attack comes. 

He told me that there’s a bunch of studies out that talks about what happens during a panic/anxiety attack and that same “reaction” is somewhat used when you try to suck on super sour candy. 

It supposedly cancels the attack out because the brain can’t react to your attack and the sour reaction at the same time. 

I was hesitant, but it’s a cheap trick to try, and I will say, I’m not sure if it’s placebo, BUT it did help when I tried it. It’s almost like your brain switches its “fight or flight” attention to the sourness. 

Worth a shot!"

I've always thought I had more than just anxiety and OCD, and with the rise of mental health (I think it's great that it's talked about), every time I read or hear that someone has problems of any kind, I have to look into what that person feels to see if I identify with them and can suffer from the same mental illness.

 This compsumes a lot of time.. Sometimes I even feel the symptoms of mental illnesses that people around me or even celebrities show, such as bipolar disorder or depression. I become obsessed with it and I identify with it, so I start monitorizing all my thoughts, emotions…

197cdbi,Anxiety,2024-01-15,weird and unexplainable feeling whenever i see myself exposed,"A short introduction about me might help to understand the feeling and hopefully not misinterpret it into something else. 
I am 16(F) , from my description of the feeling it might seem that I have issues with the way i view my body, but that is really not the case. I am not insecure about my body at all, i’ve always been naturally skinny and personally I am grateful for that. Growing up, in middle school especially, I had a lot of comments about my body(calling me too skinny/weird names/excluding me from their groups/bullying because I wasn’t a “curvy” body type, etc) , that affected my mental health a lot, but I don’t think this feeling has anything to do with it, because it has been haunting me from way before i even got to middle school. So I don’t think body image has anything to do with it, especially because most of the times (NOT always) I look at myself and think I am very pretty right before getting that feeling(And it doesn’t make me feel ugly it just makes me feel anxious) Also i don’t have issues with going outside/interacting with people, so thats another thing that I think we shouldn’t consider when trying to figure out the cause of this feeling. Still,though, i suffer from generalized anxiety(not diagnosed but I freak out over the smallest things  and it’s a struggle to live like this but im not going to go in depth about it , you just have to take my word for it)
I am going to try to describe the feeling as well as I can, but please keep in mind that it’s genuinely something I can never fully  comprehend. It’s like a very short feeling of the usual anxiety that i normally feel , but this starts in my stomach and fills up my whole body for a couple of seconds and then it disappears, but it ruins my whole mood and makes me feel very insecure.
I don’t even know what exactly is triggering it. It usually happens in front of the mirror, when i get dressed for going somewhere ( eg :school, hang out with friends ,etc) . 
Let’s say I put on a crop top that I have worn before and never felt uncomfortable about it, but for some reason i look in the mirror and feel like a cold breeze hitting my belly/the anxiety feeling i have just described.Today it happened when i was trying on some jeans,cold breeze and then anxiety. I tried thinking about how it might be a sensory issue caused by the cold breeze itself, but there’s never really a cold breeze, it’s something made up by my brain for some reason and that’s how this feeling starts. Usually after that happens i feel very insecure in my clothes and feel like i am too “exposed” even though most of the times i am NOT exposed at all.It sometimes makes me feel too “sexual” when i am not dressed in a vulgar way at all.
This was a struggle to compose strictly because of how abstract the feeling is and how little i know about it. All i want to know if there’s anyone that understands what im talking about or has a friend that does. I want to figure out what it is and eventually how to stop it."

197bd7l,Anxiety,2024-01-15,Sertraline side effects,"Hi everyone :)

Let me just start this with I am going to talk to my doctor, but in the mean time I’d love to hear if anyone has experienced these side effects.

I have been prescribed Sertraline 50MG a day, for severe panic attacks &amp; anxiety (I have a lot of health anxiety at the moment) and just general life anxiety, off sick from work &amp; I just bought my first property alone so I am also very stressed.

I took my first 50MG pill at 10pm on Friday. I slept for a few hours and then woke up in the night extremely drowsy and out of it &amp; this lasted most of Saturday. So I was scared to take 50MG again, I just took 25MG on Saturday at 10pm.

I woke up Sunday morning and was feeling super panicky so I took the other 25MG at 11am that I skipped the previous night. Fell asleep for a nap &amp; woke up and suddenly my tongue and lips were  numb, but only on the left side of my face. Then it spread to my left check as-well. I called 111 (I’m in the UK, it’s a medical advice line) they said I don’t have other stroke symptoms so they weren’t overly concerned, but they did say it’s strange it’s only on left side of my face.

I’ve also had ZERO appetite &amp; haven’t been able to eat since I took the first pill. I’m super nauseas. Constantly feel I’m about to be sick, even just drinking an orange juice made me sick.

My right arm &amp; both my legs keep like twitching, almost spasms for a lack of better word. 

I haven’t taken any more sertraline since yesterdays 25MG at 11am, but I’m scared to because these side effects are really dreadful. 

I am waiting for my referral for help with alcohol dependency too, but the doctor said sertraline is safe to take whilst drinking. Don’t love to openly say that, but maybe someone else here has experienced this mix.

Apologies for the lengthy post, hope you are all having a splendid day. TIA :)"

197a1c2,Anxiety,2024-01-15,How do you return to normalcy when you experience realization due to anxiety attacks?,"I (f21) recently had an an anxiety attack like I never had before. I was extremely disconnected from my reality, but still had the ability to rationalize that it was indeed an anxiety attack. I am proud of my resilience through that specifically, but it took so much out of me and I am left feeling like a shell of who I was. Throughout the duration the weight of all of the emotions and just how many things I need to do day to day to function and maintain life in general were overwhelming.

Two days later, I am still feeling a lot of residual anxiety, and I am worried that feeling will return the same or worse. I don’t understand what the point of all of this is. Not to the extent of not wanting to be here, I truly do value my life and the people in it, but I can’t seem to shake this feeling of everything just being totally pointless and abstract. 

I ordered some crafty things on Amazon to distract myself and I’m following my routines of getting up in the mornings and going to work, but this nagging heaviness just sticks. 

Ive struggled with having a rocky relationship with food for a long time, and my experience with that is you can only over reach 99% recovery. I eat well now and I find so much joy in cooking for people and nourishing my body, but I have to be cautious of triggers, for what I am assuming is the rest of my life. Will that be the case with anxiety like this? Will life ever be as beautiful as it was before? Are there some ways I can ground myself? Meditation has always been a challenge for me, as I tend to get racing thoughts when I am under-stimulated. I just want my life back. I was happy and healthy and finally thriving.

1978u20,Anxiety,2024-01-15,Worry and guilt that something bad will happend to my close ones because of me,"Hi everyone.

Have you experienced worry and guilt that if something bad happens to your close ones because of you?

When I (26F) argue with my parents, I often worry that they will get heart or brain stroke because I am stressing them. I am talking about even when small disagreements happen. I usually want to say my opinion, and they think I am to stubborn and they are always right. For example when we have disagreement about something, and when there is too much tension, my mum will say don't stress your dad, and he will go in the room, and wouldn't show all night, so I am sending my sister to check if he is breathing and if he is fine.

Or I have the same worry with my boyfriend that will happen something bad to him because of me. For example if I say let's go somewhere with a car, he is the one who is driving, and I worry that if we get in a car accident, something bad will happen to him because I had told him to take that route.

This happens really often, and I know the reason for this, it is because my mum is always saying not to stress someone in those kind of situations because I share my opinions.
I have already talked to my psychotherapist about this in one session, but I think I should go more in deep in future sessions. 

I had small disagreement with my grandma few nights ago, and I couldn't fall a sleep because of worrying that something bad will happen to her during the night.

There is another case in my family, my other grandma stopped taking her heart medication few years ago, and she got heart stroke, and later when she started talking again, she said it was because we weren't at my cousin's birthday. My mum and her sister were not on good terms at that time, and we were not speaking with my mum's side of the family. 

Have you experienced something like this? How do you deal with it?

I worry too much if something bad happens to my close ones, and in their last moments together, we were mad to each other."

I'm fine in local areas that I know well...much less fine on highways, freeways and in areas I'm unfamiliar with. Anxiety manifests as intrusive thoughts about accidents and hyper vigilance. Once I've completed an (unfamiliar) trip, I feel pretty tense for a while.

I'm not sure if it's just a branch off the general anxiety tree but it's the only thing that limits my functionality specifically.

When I visit my anxiety is along much lower it had been a year since I was last over but something about this time was so much easier. I went to visit him over the holidays ( a stressful time for me and a lot of people in general) and my anxiety disappeared. I am questioning if my anxiety is related to my environment more than anything else upon arriving back in the US.

I was over there for 3 week and I wasn’t anxious! I take medication to manage my anxiety as it comes and didn’t feel a need to take them. I got sick when I was over which is a big stressor for me and didn’t have a problem dealing with it. I was able to travel alone thru the country and didn’t having a problem dealing with the travel anxiety and felt safe even with not speaking the language. I was able to work on my art and focus and taking care of myself with ease….my general anxiety was at an all time low. Swedes don’t put high value on your occupation so I never really talked about work or had a moment to feel insecure about my job because work is work.

I don’t know if it’s being with my partner that made everything so easy. My anxiety didn’t flair up when he was at work and was chill with the intense holiday schedule we were up against. I didn’t reach for doctor google which is my weak point for fueling my anxiety. When he comes and visit my anxiety is better but not nearly as good!

I work a full time management job in retail and live at home because I honestly can’t afford to visit my boyfriend and pay my bills without it! I live in a bigger city but commute out of the city.

1976n6j,Anxiety,2024-01-15,Anxiety comeback,"Hello guys

I have had anxiety for a decade this year. I have always had a concerned mind. I am medicated with 20 mg escitalopram daily.
I have dealt with several forms of the sickness such as very physical symptoms such as heartburn, disorientation, hyperventaling, nausea, overall pain in the body and worst of all at the moment; distress in the body. A few weeks back I had a major anxiety attack (the first one in years). It was triggered by the thought of that I had to die one day and I would probably never live again, the universe isnt gonna last forever etc. Since then I have been affected by the attack, yet I focused on going back to work and following structures since thats good for mind. At least thats what I learned these last ten years. To get my mind away from the concerns and anxiety.

Last night I slept very late, which led me to stay home from work. My body was fully alert and working overtime. This time there was no specific thoughts triggering the reaction. So my body goes crazy, but it isnt triggered by any concern at the moment. 

I have some concerns that I am trying to deal with such as: wanting to be a mom, being afraid that I have cancer (lost a friend this time last year) and also whether I will be able to keep working at my awesome teacherjob.
All of the above, I know, is more than enough to feel stressed and not in control, but the thing is that my body is reacting at times where I havent even thought about my concerns.

So.. yeah.. it probably sounds like I have to start seeing a therapist again, which is also my plan, but do you guys have any tips I can start working on right now? I really want to go back to work tomorrow for example.

Any help would be appreciated! What do you do to a nerve system in full alarm mode?

I've been taking Citalopram for about 6 weeks now. My anxiety is still challenging to manage, but there's some improvement. 

I've been in therapy since last summer and am making progress. 

Currently, I'm worried about the possibility of not being able to stop Citalopram after recovery. The medication feels strong and seems to alter my brain chemistry, hopefully for the better. My psychiatrist advised me to continue it for relief while working on therapy.
However, I've read about many people struggling to wean off the medication after it stabilizes in their brain. 

My plan isn't to stay on the medication for more than a year. I aim to replace it with more physical activity and meditation, which I'm currently finding hard to commit to due to high anxiety and low mood. 

Does anyone have a positive experience to share?

Thanks, everyone!"

197588s,Anxiety,2024-01-15,What are these “attacks” and what can I do about it?,"I used to have health anxiety with panic attacks multiple times a day during which I thought I was dying. 

Now, about 3 years after my first panic attack I’ve been to therapy and I’d say I’m almost cured of health anxiety. I rarely get real panic attacks anymore, maybe once every few months and I generally don’t worry about my health. 

However, I do still get some sort of attacks very often that resemble the physical symptoms of panic attacks but without the anxiety: 
- a painful knot in my upper belly
- headache and pain/a tingling feeling on the left side of my head 
- feeling out of breath, have to constantly remind myself not to hyperventilate 
- sometimes heart palpitations and chest pressure
- sometimes feeling nauseous/dizzy

This feeling often lasts for several days.

I am fairly certain it’s still at least stress related because I often feel better when engaging in an activity and worse at night. I don’t know what to do about it though, since I feel like I’ve done the mental work and don’t worry about it being a stroke or whatever. Can this be a migraine and does anyone recognize this?"
19757m2,Anxiety,2024-01-15,Blood in spit? Anxiety related?,"22 m, 88kg , active, 5ft 10 , non smoker 

I have severe health anxiety and often have panic attacks and a lot of physical issues from anxiety so its hard to know when an issue is serious or not.

I have a history of nose bleeds that got worse 2 years ago where I had my nose capitalized and they stopped, in the last 6 months I started spitting blood and had my nose capitalized and it stopped for a few weeks then came back, had my other side of my nose vaporized 3 months ago and it once again stopped.

Now its come back, the feeling g is like the top of my throat that connects to my hose is very try like I need to keep drinking water and the spit isnt always bloodyx it's more so if I create a seduction with my mouth or spit repeatedly checking for blood. I have no other symptoms other than anxiety.

I have been doctors many times and had no scans but each time they just send me get my bose cautarized and I guess it is nose related as that usually stops it for a short while.

Is it as simple as my anxiety is making my throat and nose dry that causes blood and I should jus ignore it and lower stress and it will go? Or should I  push to have it looked at further?

Also it's never a lot of blood, it's like the same small amount as one my get if they brushed teeth but I'm sure it's not from teeth as I have the same feeling at eht back of my throat and nose each time.

Any advice would be helpful, I'm more looking at possible causes to see how much I should worry as its possible my anxious lifestyle could be causing throat and nose issues. Obviously with health anxiety my mind immediately goes to oh great lung cancer but the cautarizing that stops it seems to I dictate it from my nose or throat 

Also to note, before anxiety I never had blood in spit. So is it possible my anxiety is just drying out my nose and throat causing trace amounts of blood?"

I was diagnosed with a panic disorder in 2020/2021 if im not mistaken, later I stopped having panic attacks and just bad anxiety all because of a trigger event in the summer where I got covid away from home (I was already feeling homesick) and the friends I was with weren’t very supportive or friendly. I started psychotherapy and taking Sertraline (I started at 50mg then 100mg and now I’m at 50mg again bcs I honestly thought these feelings might be from meds and my psychiatrist told me to reduce them and see if those feelings got better) because I was starting to have rlly bad intrusive thoughts about my health and other topics that rlly disturbed me..everything got very better after a while I got into university and everything was going fine. 

I notice I get more nervous during exam week at uni and my anxiety gets worse, even if I don’t notice my mom would, but this time I started feeling droozy, tired and I feel like I’m always not present like I’m in a dream..i have felt like this before but it would only last like 3 days in the worst case scenario but now I have been feeling detached from myself and the environment around me for a week, I feel fatigued from this..

I tried to better my study and not feeling bad for not studying by making a schedule so I can get rest and still study what I need to, this didn’t make anything better tho.
It’s extremely hard to look at stuff during the day because for some reason daylight makes it feel worse? Idk I’m rlly tired and I just wanna be ok..I feel like this affects my memory and it makes every task more difficult, plus makes me paranoid like “maybe I have some life threatening illness” and that thought SCARES me

I've been dealing with Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) for several years. Recently, my job has taken me to Africa, and it's been challenging. I feel trapped and stressed due to work, with limited support available.  
  
I've developed heart palpitations and episodes of high blood pressure. Previously, I was on Zoloft, which alleviated the palpitations but didn't address my anxiety. A few months ago, I began experiencing hot flashes and intermittent chest pain. During these episodes, I noticed my blood pressure spiking to 180/80.  
  
I've undergone a heart echocardiogram, blood tests, and a stress test. Consequently, I was prescribed Effexor, starting at a dose of 37.5 mg. I've been taking it for the past five days. However, last night was particularly rough, with continuous hot flashes and my blood pressure fluctuating significantly, ranging from 130 to 160, over a span of two hours.  
  
I'm still trying to understand what's happening. My local doctor, as well as my doctor back home, insist that these are symptoms of panic attacks.

So I’m a junior in college and I really love my program, but I’ve had very unfortunate housing situations every year. I have a severe phobia of bugs, and grew up in an area without roaches, but go to school in an area with lots of them (apparently my friends do not see them as often as I do, they believe I’m cursed). Last year my apartment had a cockroach infestation, and while I did not like them initially, I now have a paralyzing fear of them. This has led to my already severe fear of bugs becoming worse. I live alone this year because I get overstimulated with roommates, and have had a couple roach incidents, but nothing that I think is uncommon for an apartment in the area. My apartment’s maintenance has been good about treating my unit. I have found that I am able to deal with bugs in my apartment when I call a close friend who knows about my anxiety, but once I deal with it and hang up, I get massive anxiety attacks. Today I flew back from winter break and the second I stepped out of the airport I was on edge. I just don’t know what to do. I’m trying to get into therapy but I feel like I hate the city I go to school in so much that I’m worried it’s ruining my experience. I just want to go home but I want to graduate, and my degree really does best when I stick to one in-person program my full four years. It’s especially hard because I didn’t particularly like living at home growing up and spent my entire life trying to get out, but I hate where I live now more. I’ve considered finding a new apartment for next year (potentially going back to having roommates), but I’ve already renewed my current lease and am worried that a new living situation could end up being worse. My experiences here have just made this city so anxiety-inducing for me that I’ve wondered if I need to institutionalize myself, but when I was home for break I didn’t feel nearly as stressed. I really really want to stay here so I can graduate but I can’t imagine that it has to come with consistent anxiety attacks and a fear of my own home. I get nightmares and feel like I’m constantly examining my surroundings for bugs - I honestly wonder if I have some sort of PTSD from my infestation. Any genuine advice would be welcome.

I take Zoloft and I take it right before I go to bed. This unfortunately leads to this unfortunate series of events every once in a while:

I will tuck myself in, super cozy under a mountain of blankets and covers, then go to take my meds and realize, ""Oh! I'm out of water!""

Most of the time I will go get more water, but when I'm just so cozy and really don't want to get up, I'll go, ""what's the worst that could happen?"" and just use my spit to swallow the pill.

I don't experience any real issues right away, but as I'm trying to fall asleep, oh no! What's this? Just my hubris in the form of acid reflux because I flew too close to the sun and believed the sheer force of my coziness would fend off the burning in my throat, but no.

I then find myself in the kitchen at 2 a.m. chugging water and googling what I can do to get rid of this because I was double hubristic and thought I didn't need to have any tums on hand in my apartment.

Eventually the pain subsides and I go to sleep, remembering to not do this for the next few months until my hubris gets the better of me once more."

The doctor did the exam and lo and behold I have a detached retina 🙃 I knew something was off when the doctor was taking her time examining my left vs right eye.

I am totally freaked out my anxiety has been a little rough, my heart rate is racing as I’m typing this and my biggest concern is the anesthetic part.

I began to cry to my husband because I went down all these Reddit pages regarding the procedure and people’s results/postop/

1972nv9,Anxiety,2024-01-15,Life become too overwhelming I find myself not knowing what to do,"
Would anyone have any advice??

I feel like I don't know what to do
Sometimes it feels like my thoughts are screaming at my head 

I feel like my energy levels fluctuate to much and everything gets overwhelming

It keeps getting unbearable
At least I think it's anxiety. 

When I'm depressed I can still do stuff I'd just have low energy and maybe question motivations. Anxiety definitely more on the hyper side of it mentally but it feels like there is no motivation. 

Sure there's a lot of energy but it due to stress, and maybe way too much energy or bad energy. 
Sometimes I can't even calm myself down. It also feels like my head gets migraines as well and I feel like I can't sit still.

I avoid people during this because I find I lash out.

Idk I've been wanting to do art and writing but every few weeks or so just everything would become overwhelming."

1972loi,Anxiety,2024-01-15,Messy handwriting anxiety,"TL;DR Sorry for the huge wall of text!! I didn't mean to say so much haha. I'm just looking for advice, and if anyone else experiences discomfort with handwriting due to a fear of it being messy.

So, basically writing anything by hand causes me distress to the point where I avoid writing things by hand if I can get around it (i can take extreme lengths to avoid triggers that induce even mild anxiety). This fluctuates a lot and has been a problem since childhood (possibly started around the age of 10), and the past year or so it has been impacting my quality of life because I can't tolerate writing in my journal and making shopping lists out of fear that my handwriting will be messy or I'll make spelling mistakes.

For me, the process typically goes something like this: writing something down -&gt; negative thoughts that it's not perfect -&gt; urge to scrap the piece of paper I'm writing on and start again, and then either 1. start over again (increasing self-destructive thoughts), or 2. stop the task and avoid completely.

If I were to pinpoint specific memories that could have caused this, I'd say that I could have just absorbed this core belief through the standards held by my adult family members and teachers. The person didn't have to be abusive at all to reinforce this belief, in fact I think it's the opposite, that out of respect for the people I admired when I was younger I was more likely to be influenced by their standards either imposed on myself or themselves.

I don't think I have OCD and I haven't sought out a diagnosis, but my anxiety often manifests in similar ways and I personally find coping strategies specifically for OCD to be helpful. I haven't been able to find anything helpful on this by searching online, but I might not be typing the right words. It's possible that my problem isn't even along the same vein as anxiety (and may be due to autism, ADHD, or a combination of things), but I'm eager to learn any possible reasons and solutions as to why I'm having such a strong response to handwriting."
1972iro,Anxiety,2024-01-15,tuesday.,"(this is gonna be a big rant so strap in) 

is anyone else absolutely dreading going back to school/ work in tuesday? personally, i’m in school and i’ve been insanely overwhelmed by the amount of school work that i have missing, and in result i’ve been ignoring my friends and staying in the library all day. obviously i can’t stay in the library al day but if i do go to class, i have no clue what the teacher is talking about , and in result, i end up panicking and hiding in the bathroom, creating more missing work. i’ve tried to explain this to my guidance councilor so that she would continue letting me work in the library but she always tries to negotiate going to at least one class. i don’t know how to explain to her that i’m not benefiting from being in a classroom and it’s only making me worse. every time i have tried, i could tell that she wasn’t taking me seriously, and that she was going to force me to go to class. my guidance counselor also created a 504 plan for me based on what SHE thought would benifit me. she didn’t ask me what i wanted on my 504 plan and she just gave me one extra day to turn in assignments and i get to choose where i sit. 

can someone please give me some advice?"
1972gt1,Anxiety,2024-01-15,Random wave of anxiety,"Hi 
  The last few weeks I've felt extremely anxious for no real reason. Of course there's a couple things stressing me out but none of it seems to be the reason I feel like this. It just feels totally random. 
   I feel shaky, agitated, restless, irritable, and as though something awful is happening or about to happen. I'm not having any intrusive thoughts or specific worries, I just feel anxious in my body, as though I physically can't calm down. 
    For context: About 3 months ago I reduced my sertraline from 150mg to 100mg. I did it slowly. Also, I'm on sertraline for depression. I'm not usually anxious and have never had this wave of unexplained anxiety before. 
    Has this happened to anyone else? Do yoi have any advice?"

197276z,Anxiety,2024-01-15,Lamictal,"I have done a washout of all meds. I’ve been med free for about three weeks. Before this, I had tried Wellbutrin which made me angry and manic, Lexapro which was great until it randomly made me moody and depressed, Buspar which also worked well but then led to moodiness and depression as well. I have also tried Cymbalta + Effexor which again worked well until it didn’t. And finally I tried Abilify which made me so sleepy I’d fall asleep in class and almost couldn’t drive. At some point I was on Lamictal 25 mg with other meds but that’s such a low dose I’ll never know if it was working. And, yes I see a therapist. 
I’m considering trying Lamictal alone. Any success stories? 
My problem is anxiety that eventually leads to depression when out of hand. Small conflicts or failures cause a huge drop in my stomach like going down a roller coaster and then my mind is stuck circling the negativity for hours…"

1971vyh,Anxiety,2024-01-15,Work anxiety / meetings,"I work as an support engineer, I repair computers for the healthcare and it's a lot of responsibility. 

I take this job too seriously and it's affecting me when I am home and in the weekends. I cannot relax when I am home.

I get a lot of anxiety if there are any meetings with customers and phone calls and this is something I cannot avoid because the meetings are usually about problems that the customer has.

Worth to note that adds up to the anxiety is that I have Usher Syndrome, that means I was born deaf (I have cochlear implants) I have balance issues and I am slowly going blind due to an eye dissease called Retinis Pigmentosa. 

There has been nothing wrong with the work environment but the company is very small and I feel like I am not willing to put all my energy into the company, due to my eye dissease. When I come home from work I am mentally exhausted and usually fall asleep 2 hours after comming home from work..

It feels like I have no freedom at home.

I feel like I would have less anxiety if I did not work as a support engineer / helpdesk. It's too much responsibility and the anxiety is a lot when a problems comes in."

1971o4e,Anxiety,2024-01-15,How do I adapt to working life?,"I'm an intern (and a uni student in my penultimate year), I took 6 months off school for an internship. This internship is in an MNC and it's a marketing role. I am a STEM student. 

So far, I've been dreading going every single day, and I can't stop feeling guilty about not doing my work after work hours or on the weekends. This is a student mindset, where I would do my assignments on the weekends or late at night. Work is 8.30am to 5.30pm and technically I should stop thinking about it after 5.30pm but I can't.

I can't stop worrying about it. And everh week I have a ""catch up"" meeting with my supervisor where we discuss what I've done the week before, etc. I was assigned a ton of reading but I kept procrastinating and tomorrow is the meeting. It doesn't help that I was assigned more work throughout the week, so I shifted my focus onto completing those, than on the reading I was supposed to do.

I'm stressing out because I have to wake up at 6.30am to 7am everyday to get to work on time, and sleep early for that. I feel like I don't have time for things that I want to do. I want to start working out at the gym with a personal trainer, and get fit, but I find it so hard to find time for that. Especially when it's the evening by the time I get home and I just want to rest. I keep thinking about all the things I have to do, and all the other employees that are above me that I have to interact with and impress. They are basically my bosses and every time I see them I feel so guilty about everything.

How do I stop this feeling of guilt that keeps arising even though I'm not really behind on my work?"

So for the past 6 ish months, every couple weeks, I’ve been getting woken up (sometimes an hour after going to sleep or sometimes well into the night 3am etc) by a very uncomfortable, tight, anxiety feeling in my chest. My whole body feels uncomfortable/panicked and as much as I try to let it pass and continue sleeping it only worsens and I have no choice but to get up. I’ve found eating a snack and walking around eases it. 

I’ve read about nocturnal panic attacks and don’t find myself having the same symptoms (no sweating/nausea/extreme panic etc). My experience seems pretty mild in comparison. The only similarity is the anxiety and tightness mainly in my chest and the mental feeling like i’m scared. I know it has to be anxiety related but it’s so odd. I’ve had anxiety my entire life but have never had this happen! 

I recently started taking Lexapro (about to start week 2) and have noticed my daytime anxiety getting better but this nighttime  weirdness hasn’t changed. This started before I took Lexapro. Luckily it’s so sporadic that it doesn’t affect me every night… but i’d still like to figure out what’s going on."
196zzhn,Anxiety,2024-01-15,Health Anxiety related to schizophrenia,"Hi! Sorry this is a little long so I cut out some details but the main jist is there.

I (23m) have had the fear of developing schizophrenia over the last couple months after having a cannabis induced panic attack back in august. Basically I smoked a joint while watching a tiktok about weed side effects, didn’t think much of it then hopped in the shower then experienced my heart racing, racing thoughts, shaking, impending sense of doom, and just like oh shit i fucked up weird feeling. This lasted a few hours with brief periods of calming myself down but still feeling weird then fell asleep and felt fine next morning. Until a week later I had the impending sense of doom randomly for 30 seconds then I stopped it but then after that I had this mega increased anxiety around developing schizophrenia and had racing and intrusive thoughts that wouldn’t stop until I talked to my mom and felt better until one day it got so bad that I went to the emergency and they said it was anxiety not schizophrenia which was a relief, they gave me an ativan which helped that night but the racing and intrusive thoughts started up again in the morning. I had dr appt couple days later where I got prescribed 50mg of sertraline and a day later the anxiety lessened significantly (placebo effect?). I got connected with a therapist and they said I have health anxiety and we have been doing CBT and eventually DBT i think, it has helped as it’s given me the tools to help me think more rationally when i’m trigged about schizophrenia. I def feel I have a better handle on my health anxiety but it still gets the better of me a lot of the time and was wondering if there was anything I can do that helped other people with a similar health anxiety of developing schizophrenia? 

Some more context, great uncle (who i never met) was diagnosed with schizophrenia around age 10. I also smoked weed on and off couple times a month from 15-18 then 21-23 where I smoked nightly for 3 months up till the panic attack and have been sober since. I think these are the reasons my anxiety is latching onto thinking I’ll develop schizophrenia. Just feel kinda stuck. Any help is welcome!"

What I want to know is are my worries unfounded?  Do vet clinics take appointments from those who are not official clients. Can you really just take your cat/pet to any vet? It might be silly but I'm really worried about this and I'm feeling really anxious about my cat's health.

My blood pressure is normally below 120/80. So I completely freaked when I saw that number. I started silently shutting down and decided to try to stretch and take deep breaths.

Immediately when I woke up this morning I thought: BLOOD PRESSURE. So I peed, took some deep breaths, and my reading was still high. It was like 118/90. I was home alone this time and I started sweating like crazy. My hands and feet were tingling. My vision got all weird. Full on panic mode. I thought I was actually having a stroke or cardiac problems. I debated on calling a paramedic over because I was paralyzed sitting on the floor.

196xmfd,Anxiety,2024-01-15,"Can panic attacks, anxiety or adrenaline rush mimic angina?","I’m a 23-year-old guy, I’ve been suffering from panic attacks for 5 years, I’ve been taking antidepressants for a total of 4 years and benzodiazepines for 3 years in a row (I was able to quit a few months ago). I suffer from extrasystole in all areas of the heart, I also have poor cardiac genetics on my father’s side (all men died before the age of 50 from atherosclerosis and coronary heart disease). I regularly have a very high level of anxiety and panic attacks. Now is the period when I stopped taking antidepressants for exactly 1 year, I used to take paroxetine, due to its use and olanzapine I gained a lot of weight and was 100 kg with a height of 175 cm, now from 2022 to 2023 I have lost weight to 70 kg. All this time I suffered from cardiophobia and a cardiac type of anxiety, that is, I always felt the symptoms of chronic pressure in the chest (not during physical activity, but in general just always), heaviness of breathing, which sometimes disappeared - sometimes they appeared. For the last year I have not been taking antidepressants and, in general, I rarely take medications, but in the last six months I have begun to experience some new strange attacks related to the heart; during strong emotional experiences (anxiety or after a conflict with someone), I begin to feel a sharp attack of heaviness in breathing and compression in the chest, feeling how this pressure and compression spreads and I basically inhale air, but it doesn’t seem to remove the feeling of suffocation. This lasts no more than a minute, but then fades away and symptoms of panic and anxiety begin to appear. I have suffered from panic attacks for too long and can tell the difference between hyperventilation and chest discomfort from panic attacks and this weird thing. After that, I had the same attack again when, in a state of anxiety, after some time I went to the gym (I had gone there before, I trained at a heart rate of 150-170, everything was okay), this attack happened, I stopped going to the gym. I went to the doctor, did the usual ECG and EchoCG, and the results of bicycle ergometry were good. On bicycle ergometry there was no pathological activity at a pulse of 160-180 for several minutes. I gave up, started living a normal life, continued going to the gym and training from time to time, walking every day out, hanging out in the night clubs. I regularly did push-ups about 50 times, at a high heart rate, walked outside almost every day for 2 months for 10k-12.5k steps, until stress began again in my life - literally a week ago I broke up with my girlfriend (I I had the highest level of anxiety every day, tears, screams, lack of sleep, and so on) and I started having health problems not related to my heart - I just had a stomach ache. - I went to the doctor and I was late for the visit and decided to run to the doctor for 2 minutes in a light jog in the morning and the same attack repeated - I ran and began to feel severe shortness of breath, pressure in the chest, increasing weakness in the limbs, all the symptoms of shortness of breath and pressure in the The breasts grew stronger and stronger until I stopped and sat down.I immediately began to feel a slight panic, severe anxiety, I sat down, this pressure in the chest lasted less than 1 minute and shortness of breath, I sat down and felt more or less better. By the way, in the morning I woke up in wild anxiety - I went to the doctor in wild anxiety, but before running I had no anxiety at all. I sat for 5 minutes and went to the doctor in a state of anxiety, climbed a very uncomfortable 5-story staircase, where my watch recorded a pulse of 160 for 2-3 minutes, this attack did not recur. All these years I have regularly undergone heart tests, echocardiography, ecg, etc. and everything is absolutely normal. I am very afraid that I have an early stage of angina pectoris, the same attack was repeated with me at rest when I was lying on the bed, but most often after physical activity. I don't understand what's wrong with me. Because during a period of 2 months when I didn’t have stress, I went in for sports, rode an exercise bike for 30 minutes - 40 minutes without stopping, with a heart rate of 160, everything was fine. I did strength training with a pulse of 170 - the same. But as soon as the stress began again during the first run, it happened again. I ask you for help, colleagues on the problem, I am ready to help myself if I need something... I can’t understand whether I have angina or whether adrenaline surges imitate this condition. I have changed many doctors, everyone literally does not want to listen, as soon as they hear a history of panic attacks or anxiety - they immediately try to blame it on this, I live in a country with a poor medical approach. But during all this time I have learned to distinguish between more or less symptoms of anxiety and panic; I have never had such attacks in my life. It’s strange that this happens very randomly, because twice it happened when I was lying on my chest in a completely calm state and playing a mobile game.  
I am very afraid of dying young, suffering from angina pectoris, and so on. Has anyone had a similar experience? During these attacks I don’t have pain, I just feel like my heart is getting heavier and pressing inside and it’s just really hard to breathe. **Write your cases, if I can help with anything and advise you in panic attacks, please contact me, I have learned a lot over so many years of experience.**  


P.S: Im very sorry to write such a big topic guys :("
196xgz5,Anxiety,2024-01-15,My fear of working out is so debilitating idk what to do,"So yeah. This probably stems from having a shitty mom but for some reason I can’t bear to work out with people near me.

Recently my parents bought a treadmill for the house and we all started using it. As someone who doesn’t work out, I started slow just like 2mph on the first day and since it was an easy pace I walked for almost 2 hours. My mom was sitting near me when I was walking, and for the next week she (and every single member of my extended family) relentlessly made fun of me for going too slow and not working out hard enough. 

Okay, I started to listen to those treadmill strut playlists where you walk to the beat of the music which each song having a higher and higher bpm. She would sit there and tell me that I’m stepping too hard and that my back jiggles when I walk. 

I started working out at 10-11pm when everyone was asleep so I wouldn’t feel judged, and then she spent two weeks saying how she didn’t believe I was working out and that I was a liar just bc she couldn’t see me. Obviously I tried to ignore her but it was incessant. 

I try waking to work or walking around the neighbourhood but she’s always the same, making fun of me or plainly not letting me because it’s “unsafe”. 

As an 18yr old living at home, my mom is the one that buys groceries. She doesn’t necessarily buy healthy food, and when she does I’m not allowed to touch it because it is hers. She makes most meals, so I have to eat whatever is served to me. Whenever I’ve tried to ask her to buy me healthier things, she mockingly says things like “you eating healthy?? Who are you and what have you done with my daughter? Are you sick?” and then proceeds to not buy me the things I asked for. I’ve tried to buy things for myself but it’s really expensive and we have food stamps so it’s honestly stupid to spend so much money on my own groceries, when I have to eat her meals anyways. 

So erm yeah I’m essentially screwed. Recently she moved around the furniture in our small patio and with the rearrangement she put away the treadmill, so I can’t even do my 10pm after-work workouts. 

Anyone have any idea what the hell I could possibly do? All I want is to be healthy and move my body 😭😭😭😭😭"

196x5tb,Anxiety,2024-01-15,"Not All Days Are Good, But There Is Good In Every Day","Just when you think you’ve got it all figured out; you’ve had a huge shift in mindset, you’re not being dulled by mind-numbing drugs, you’re focusing on self care and feeling better than ever; you’re hit by a bus.

  
The bus is metaphorical. It’s not real. I wasn’t hit by a bus today. Boy, wouldn’t THAT have been a story to tell.

  
No, it could be anything really. A text from your partner, a looming uni due date, an off-hand comment from a narcissistic parent, just the sight of the laundry sitting in the basket. It’s been CLEAN for DAYS and you STILL haven’t put it away? What’s WRONG with you?!!?!?!  


Maybe it manifests as severe anxiety. Your chest tightens, your stomach churns, your mind is racing, as is your heart. Every muscle in your body is tense, including that fucking jaw. This is going to hurt later.  


Or maybe it manifests in a deep depression. You crawl into bed, curtains drawn, and scroll mindlessly on your phone while trying to hold back tears and forget about the world for a while.  


Whatever it is, it’s okay. That thing that made you feel that way, that is real. The sensations you feel in your body, those are real. Your reaction to that situation and that sensation is all that you can do to survive right now, and that’s okay.  


But how long do you stay in that space? How do you get yourself out of it? What can you do to relieve those sensations and quiet your noisy mind?  


It’ll be different for everyone.  


Today, I reached out to a friend and, coincidentally, another friend reached out to me. That hasn’t happened very much in a long while and I truly welcome this friend every time they reach out. They’re someone who used to mean a great deal to me but we drifted apart. Maybe we weren’t right together at the time, maybe we would be today, maybe not, who knows?  


The point is, they’re still there. They may just be a notification on a phone, words on a screen, barely a face or a voice behind it any more. But they’re there. I appreciate them both immensely.  


I shared my current conundrum with one to get their perspective and advice so I could make good decisions about how to handle the situation that had arose. I spoke with the other about the last little while and how I’m trying really hard to get better. They were very supportive and shared their own stories of growth.  


It didn’t take too long, really, before my nervous system had calmed. Less than half an hour. My mind was less erratic, my muscles more relaxed. I noticed I was hungry, so I microwaved some pasta.  


I continued to chat with these friends until the conversations fizzled out and I spent the rest of my afternoon just resting. The emotional reaction had sapped all of my remaining energy for the day and I was now a potato.  


Potatoes like to spend time on the couch watching TV shows. With no pants on. And snacks. And it was glorious.  


It helped a lot that it was an overcast, rainy day today. The weather matched how I felt on the inside, and also gave me permission to just stay home and be a potato. I didn’t have to leave the house for anything at all, and that was okay.  


This whole growth and healing thing is seriously exhausting, and incredibly hard work. And expensive. I’ve seen my therapist 3 times now in the past week. But that’s okay, it’s an investment in myself and I’m worth it.  


So, even though today wasn’t the best day mental health-wise, and I wasn’t very productive, and I didn’t put away the basket of clean clothes, and I didn’t vacuum the floors, and I won’t be cooking anything extravagant for dinner, I feel good.  


I feel good about my ability to recognise my emotions and the physiological response they cause. I feel good that I can recognise my physiological needs and meet them as efficiently as I did. I feel good that I was able to maintain firm boundaries with others (I didn’t mention that before). And I feel good that I gave myself permission to rest and heal. I feel good.  


Not every day can be good, but there really is good in every day.  


I hope you’ve found some good in your day, too.  


Love ya x"
196wwji,Anxiety,2024-01-15,Collage,(F 17)College is coming soon and I haven't  The faintest idea of what I want to do besides go to community college and hope someone time to figure it out. It feels unfair that I had to go through all of high school suffering and having the expectations to do well but no one was really helping me besides the school. Better than part of me tells me it's not my fault then I don't want to bang anyone besides me. I just feel like I'm kind of drifting and as college goes closer my fear of Growing up and actually standing on my own 2 feet when I've had to depend on what's gonna happen when I don't have this routine to look forward to anymore. What's gonna happen when stuff suddenly changes I hate change change makes me freak out cry like when I change from this routine I've been in for 12 years. Expected to know what student loans are in taxes and how to do them and to keep up with this and to keep up with that. I don't know I just don't feel good right now I feel jealous and scared and honestly listened to people around me and even people who are close to me blind colleges and working so hard and being so ready and so sure. Makes me feel like I'm hopeless I'm always just gonna be left behind or just one level below kids makes me feel like I'm gonna continue to make stupid decisions and Just gonna be stuck here.
196wtep,Anxiety,2024-01-15,"Sorry for such a common question, but, what actually helps with social anxiety?","I want to start taking small steps. I have no real issues leaving my home and going to a local store or places I recognise. The issue for me is going to really public areas and taking public transport. Recently I took one big step and that is cutting out caffeine from my life. I am 2 months into doing so.

Now I want to challenge myself. I took a blood test to see if I had any deficiencies and I am slightly low on Vitamin D. I started to take supplements as suggested by my doctor.

I want to ask those who are similar to me, who struggle/struggled to get on public transports or go to places they are not familiar with, what they did to finally be able to cope and do those things?

It's been too many years wasted I don't want to be in this cycle. Please suggest any books/apps you used, did CBT help you? I need reassurance badly"
196wq38,Anxiety,2024-01-15,Zoloft,Been on Zoloft for about 10 days. I already feel “breezier” and less filled to the rim with extreme anxiety but do the vivid nightmares ever stop? That’s my only side effect and lord it’s concerning the dreams I have.
196wib8,Anxiety,2024-01-15,Cardiaphobia,"(19M) Soooo i have been dealing with cardiaphobia for around 2 years now and I'm in the same boat as a lot of you. My heart rate will shoot up super high randomly, i will get palpitations, chess pain/pressure, feeling of impending doom, arm pain, and just a overwhelming amount of anxiety..I went to the ER 23 times in 2023 because i thought i was having a heart attack or there was something wrong with my heart a few of those times i went to the ER was by ambulance because i would be in such a state of panic i couldn't move and EMT's had to come in and calm me down and take me to the hospital.  Ive had every test done multiple times on my heart and lungs possible and everything came back fine. It got so bad at some points last year i couldn't walk without it shooting up to 170-190 so my family doctor ended up putting me on a beta blocker for awhile (Atenolol) which did lower my heart rate but when i was calm and relaxed my resting heart rate would go dangerously low so i had to immediately be taken off of that. I wanted to give up so bad because for weeks i was just always in panic checking my Heart rate, blood pressure, oxygen levels, and i would use a stethoscope to listen to my heart. I basically became a prisoner in my own body never knowing if i was gonna a heart attack or my heart would just stop. so after all the testing and everything came back fine my doctor prescribed me (Ativan) which saved my life it helped tremendously with the anxiety and panic attacks and basically got rid of my cardiaphobia for awhile and i finally felt like i could live my life again. BUT the bad part about Ativan is its not a long term anxiety med because you can become very dependent on it and it can mess you up if you take it for to long. So i had to stop taking it so often which intern brought everything back and i was right back to were i started. So after more ER visits because i thought i was just straight up dying of something heart related. So after a lot of research on anxiety stuff i landed on medical Marijuana i started using it in March of 2023 and it worked wonders it kept me calm and relaxed and i wouldn't worry about my heart anymore which was great. But as great as it was it also has its own problems it would make me super sleepy and just not really motivated to do anything anymore and smoking it obviously isn't great on your lungs or your heart. It also gave me really bad GI problems. but as i kept using it i would need to use more and more to keep me calm and feel the same effects as when i first started smoking it. I was to the point were I was smoking a lot more then i should of been and one of the times i smoked way to much and freaked out and ended up in the ER and after talking to the doctors they told me i should stop using it because its only gonna make things worse in the long run which i agreed with. So i decided to cold turkey off using it and let me just tell you never to use Marijuana if you have have really bad anxiety or panic attacks because the withdraws were pure hell for a week. After finally getting clean off that i fell back into the routine of worrying about my heart. fast forward to more recent and i have been able to deal with the cardiaphobia and panic attacks a lot better now. The first thing that helped me was if you have any sort of smart watch don't wear it for awhile, if ever again as it only gonna exacerbate the problem. Because when you wear it and check your HR or do an EKG on it your reinforcing the feeling that there's something wrong with your heart so get rid of that thing!! 2nd try to do 30 minutes of cardiovascular exercise a day and if you can do it outside in fresh air. This will help keep your heart nice and healthy and it helps with anxiety. 3rd thing that helps is getting a therapist just someone you can talk to i know it can be hard to open up or even go to the appointments but going and staying consistent is key it will help. You gotta find somebody though you can get along with and feel comfortable talking about it with. And if your not able to go anywhere or not comfortable being face to face try online therapy, then you can talk with someone in the comfort of your own home. I recommend (BetterHelp) for online therapy there pretty great :) 4th is getting on some sort of anxiety medicine long term im taking (Buspirone) which has helped along side everything else i mentioned. I also still have Ativan for the really bad day's when im in a pure panic, but i take it now as needed instead of everyday. Trust me it was a long road to get where i am and im still not over it completely i still have my bad days were i think something wrong but i just gotta push forward because im in a much better place then i was a year and a half ago. I know i left a lot out so if anyone has any questions i would be more then happy to answer any questions or talk with anybody because at the end of the day were all in this together and i know each one of us will get threw this! &lt;3 "

I know that I need to be here and it's good for me but part of me just wants to stay at my parents house forever.  What's crazy is I lived in another country for the past 2 years in my own but somehow moving to a new state is giving me worse anxiety. I'm nearly 30 but I'm being such a baby.

196wdmt,Anxiety,2024-01-15,I CAN’T ESCAPE THE ALGORITHM,"So I had surgery a little over a week ago for gallbladder removal. Healing fine (if anyone is interested in how it went or has questions, there is an overly detailed post recounting the experience on my profile), I’m feeling ok, but I was so nervous for it before that day. I looked at almost anything related to surgery, anesthesia, hospital visit posts here on Reddit, blogs, vlogs, trying to just eat all the information I could so as to be prepared as much as I could be. This was probably going on for 2 weeks. 

I’ve always had an interest in medical stuff but I’m sick of it now. And every time I see some friggin teal anything it sets me in that same anxious mode I had before the surgery. But the algorithms on socials and whatnot have now been under the impression that this is something I want to see everywhere. I don’t want to see every 3rd post on my homepage as something about anxiety, I don’t want to see anesthesiologists or even dentists. I’m tired of medical stuff. Sometimes it’s not as simple to snooze. 

I know I need to take a break from my phone and have a therapy session on 1/23, so it’s just a matter of time to get there 😪"
196wclk,Anxiety,2024-01-15,"sertraline experiences? (severe anxiety, irrational fears, depression)","hey, 

so i’ve been struggling with ocd and anxiety for years now. i used to be able to fend it off pretty well by keeping myself occupied and surrounding myself with things that made me happy. unfortunately, that doesn’t work for me anymore. my mood is at an all time low, i rarely feel happy or find joy in things i used to love. my sleep is terrible, either i don’t sleep at all or just for a few hours, waking up every now and then. sometimes i don’t feel like eating at all and on other days i’m overeating like crazy. i feel nauseous throughout most of the day, almost like throwing up. i think my body has reached a point where it’s ready to give up. i don’t want to harm myself, i just find myself fantasizing how it’d be if id be gone, it’s somewhat of a peaceful thought, even though most of my fears revolve around the fact i am gonna die eventually and death is pretty much my biggest fear. the fact i know i’m dying someday makes my life miserable, it feels meaningless. 

so, after years of my anxiety and now struggling with depression for about a year, i decided to take action and find a therapist. i had a few initial sessions, i’m not in therapy yet though, that’s gonna take a few more months i fear. however, i got the opportunity to talk to a psychiatrist. the guy was a total dick and gave me a prescription for sertraline after little to no consultation. 

now i am very aware of the side effects and the unlikelihood of me being on the right dosage / meds right away (he recommended starting off with 25mg for 5 days, upping the dosage to 50mg up until i see him again which would be in a month from now), but i really feel like i can’t take it anymore. i want to feel good. i know life can be beautiful, i’m just too stupid to get some enjoyment out of it. i always find something wrong, it’s like i’m purposely trying to sabotage myself into being miserable.

i know talking to people online can’t replace consulting a professional, but i honestly don’t know what to do. i’d appreciate some advice.

for clarification, i struggle with OCD (contamination OCD and much, much more, irrational fears such as rabies, fear of death, depression)"

My doctor is dismissing all of my concerns because I’ve had a diagnosis of anxiety in the past. My doctor just won’t take anything seriously and says all she can do for me is have me take anxiety medication. I had metabolic panel, lipid panel, CBC, A1C, and TSH checked they were all normal within range. I asked if I could have my hormones checked and she straight up said no that would be stupid you’re too young. 

I am 100% percent sure I have a blood sugar issue and no one is taking it seriously. I get certain symptoms when I’m at certain blood sugars so I’m not sure why my doctor won’t wake me seriously but it’s driving me insane. 

I never used to have these issues before and now all the sudden for the past 8 months I’ve been feeling awful daily. I can’t take it anymore. I don’t know what to do but I know something is not right. Along with the blood sugar issue I’m having a few other odd symptoms. 

• gained 35 pounds in 4-5 months (prior to this I was the same weight for 3 years) 
• period is only 3 days used to be 5-6 
• feel no emotion, no anxiety, sadness, happiness nothing. 
• just feeling off all the time like something’s not right. 
• sometimes I used to get facial flushing that would last 2 hours every time. 

I just know something is not right but I don’t know how to get my doctor to take me seriously. I’m sick of self advocating and then constantly being told it’s anxiety and I need to calm down. Like I don’t even feel my anxiety anymore so there’s nothing to calm down. Im sick of being miserable and knowing something is wrong but getting no answers or help. I honestly wish I could go back to my anxiety it was a hell of a lot better than I feel now."

196v0og,Anxiety,2024-01-15,Question about mind and how I react to surroundings/ sounds,"Hello everyone, I (20M) have a question about my mind. While I’m not feeling particularly anxious at the moment, I was 2ish weeks ago more or less about my health, but have been doing better with that. There’s this one thing I’ve developed though that happens sometimes, more so when I am high (MMJ). For example, if there is a random loud sound, I feel a split second sensation in my brain/head as soon as said sound is heard. To put it in simpler terms I feel like random times when I heard random noises around me the noise makes my brain perceive it way more, to the point I said earlier. It just feels like I can feel my mind way too much sometimes. Is this a symptom of anxiety or something else? These days I smoke in the later half of the day, 5ish the earliest time. Any advice would be appreciative. 

Also: it might be worth noting that recently some nights when in the state of being awake and on the verge of falling asleep, I get adrenaline out of nowhere and wake up, my heart beating fast when it does. It’s almost like I stop breathing for a second then wake up from it. I’ve also felt something deep in my body last night as I experienced it."

Would be great to get a thread going where we can help each other or even take our mind off it. Not a doctor but sometimes it’s nice to feel less alone esp find it would be helpful at night when everyone has gone to sleep which can make your anxiety worse as you’re alone with your thoughts.

196utaj,Anxiety,2024-01-15,Anxiety causing mistakes at work?,"Hi. Just started a new professional job. I have had anxiety for a while and it always rears its head around the start of a new position.

I moved cities to come here and don't know anybody, so that makes it more difficult. But my anxiety makes me overthink every small mistake and every criticism (even if it's constructive), and believe that I'll be let go when I'm found out to be an imperfect person. This causes me to sometimes get too anxious to ask my boss for more time on an assignment, which in turn means I'm rushing through it and either miss a certain important part of it or take too long to do something that I could've done much quicker if I'd just asked for help.

I made my first big mistake last week, by rushing through an assignment and skipping over an important step. Not unfixable, but created more work.

How do I deal with this? I'm considering therapy to help manage my anxiety."

I think it’s related to my anxiety and constantly being in the fight or flight mode. Why do I think this? IF I can get to sleep long enough to reach REM sleep, I will start functioning down there during the night. Also, I was prescribed beta blocker for a rapid heartbeat as needed. Whenever I take them I feel so much calmer. 
My questions. Can bad anxiety cause ED issues? How do you get out of fight or flight mode? I feel like I’m always activated."
196ugam,Anxiety,2024-01-15,Severe anxiety and panic,I have severe diagnosed anxiety and severe panic sometimes it gets so bad that I literally feel like I’m going to pass out like I have to sit down and try to calm myself because I feel like I’m going to fall over or pass out. Also sometimes my head feels very weird like heaviness feeling or sometimes it feels like a wave went through it I can’t really explain the feeling. Has anyone else experienced this and can give me some advice.
196uc3y,Anxiety,2024-01-14,Partner with high functioning anxiety? How do I approach?,"Hi there, concerned partner here (f28). My boyfriend (m28) has always been very hardworking, a high achiever, always wanting to get to the top - very driven and ambitious which is great.

However, the longer I’ve got to know him, the more I notice day by day anxieties. Incredibly sensitive to lights and noise, easily overwhelmed, easily frustrated, needs routine, cannot relax with smoking weed (to which he says he feels almost like a different person when he does).

I’m really noticing when he’s not smoking he’s got a very anxious energy, and I find it hard to know what to do with.

I’ve been reading into it tonight and he lists all the ‘high functioning anxiety’ systems. I want to help him, and be there to support him, but I’m not entirely sure he knows he has this… 

how can I approach it so that he can learn it could be this? without hurting his feelings or like I’m trying to label?"
196u30e,Anxiety,2024-01-14,Intense health anxiety,"I've been sick a lot the past year and since I've been having weird symptoms recently I feel such insane amounts of anxiety about it. I can't sleep or think properly or even work sometimes. Im so terrified of having a serious health problem like a tumour or heart problem or debilitating autoimmune disorder. Even though the symptoms I'm experiencing are very mild I will be going to a doctor because I am so terrified. Sometimes I feel like I can't trust what the doctors are saying either because I am so convinced of my own self-diagnoses.

I've been previously diagnosed with GAD and OCD, so perhaps this has something to do with that or I'm just having a psychotic break. I don't know."
196tymd,Anxiety,2024-01-14,this just happened recently,"hi first time posting here, i just want share my experiences and the things i've been feeling these past few days. we lost a loved one last week and it really affected me a lot. i already accepted the death of my cousin, i am happy that he is at peace, and i am happy the he is no longer in pain. the thing is, my body is reacting to the overwhelming stress.

the early days since he passed, i've been on nervous mode 24/7.  i keep on burping, yawning, have cold and sweaty hands and feet, the feeling of nervousness come at the most random times even though i am not thinking about anything. my shoulders up gets warm and neck sweats even if i calm myself down and do things to keep myself busy, it still keeps coming back. sometimes i feel pressure from random points on my arms.

now, thankfully, the waves of nervousness is gone, the cold sweats, my shoulders getting warm, etc. is gone. all that's left are feelling pressure from random points in my body (arms, chest, back, etc.). and my head (random zaps and pressure). i also wake up feeling anxious and cold and idk how to describe it, my heart doesn't pound fast, i just feel ""shocked"".

how do i battle this? this is my 1st time to experiencing these symptoms and i hate myself bc i overthink my symptoms (i get stuck sometimes thinking that it's something serious and it doesn't help at all!!!)

praying and crying helped me release the heaviness that i feel inside.

does anyone feel the same symptoms?"

So i always was kind easily anxious about things, but i think in the last years/as i got older, the anxiety and/or fear hits me harder and harder.

I have OCD, what a suprise. And i can tell why i struggle with it so much, because that fear/anxiety easily fools me. It's a weakness of mine ever since i was a kid and i never really did something about it. And even with things where people do get nervous aswell like job interviews, is where i REALLY get nervous, anxious. 

And it's just so annoying. I start thinking about how it might go, worst cases, am i even good enough. Where as some others just don't really trip about it and do the interview and just come out with decent posture. 

But i just can't. I get so anxious i start to mess up my ""normal things"". I start hindering my speech and what i wanna say is unclear in my head, my voice may be shaky, my heart pumps the fuck out of my chest. I hate it.

It's just like some dark aura coming to consume me whenever there is something important or else going on, and i function worse or differently. I hate it. It also make me avoid alot of things just because i am so afraid. "
196sddz,Anxiety,2024-01-14,I’m immensevely scared of dying and losing my loved ones and it’s ruining my life,"
When I was younger I lived a very bad trauma around death and the two other times I was ever confronted to death were just as traumatic if not more. From then on I’ve developed really bad anxiety and have developed BPD. The trauma and anxiety surrounding death has been flared up by Russia - Ukraine war and the current threats of North Korea against South Korea and the U.S., basically anything that brings us closer to a nuclear war. From that, the thought of losing my loved ones, especially my mother and sister (death trauma is intricately linked to them), is absolutely horrible. My anxiety makes me imagine horrible scenarios in which I see them panic, die and just be vulnerable to the threat which is simply horrible. On top of that I’m moving to Paris this month (I’m french but my family is from the south) and I’ve been thinking I’m more at risk in case there is nuclear reaction and my dad works in Paris so the thought of us bought dying is horrible and unbearable. I’ve been quite good at managing it since I try to meditate, keep going out, exercice and try to keep a steady routine but I can’t ignore how much panic and anxiety I feel. 
I‘m in survival mode, barely sleep and when I do I dream about war and death, I barely eat, even when I try to keep a steady routine and see people my mind is elsewhere completely obsessed by this. I’ve been doom scrolling, trying to find an answer to wether or not we’re all about to die from nuclear war because of North Korea. I just can’t do this anymore. On top of that I can’t see a future for myself, my anxiety is tricking me to the point where I wonder if it’s predicting the future. 
I know people also keep telling me North Korea has always been bad but it just seems to be getting worse. 

P.S: I am not self diagnosed, I have been medically diagnosed with both generalised anxiety disorder and BPD."

196rpf4,Anxiety,2024-01-14,How worried about lung cancer should i be?,"Hello everyone,

i (17f) have been experiencing slight shortness of breath (feeling like i cant breathe in as much as i should and becoming breathless by running very quickly) for a few months now, as well as clear mucus in throat, constant need to cough and a raspy sound when i breathe in and out through my mouth (not through my nose unless i breathe in very heavily) that i can also feel below my left rib for about a week now. I developed these symptoms after taking antibiotics for sinusitis after having covid. I also experience pain behind my shoulder blades quite often (experiencing this for a good year now), my doctors told me it's just because my chest is quite heavy and straining my back, but i don't really believe that...

So, as mentioned, i've been experiencing shortness of breath way longer. I'm really scared of having lung cancer, because my parents smoke inside and i sometimes accidentally breathe in the smoke when i am downstairs even though i try to hold my breath. In addition to this, i've also lost 4kg in the past 1 and a half months (i am on a diet (1600 - 1700kcal/day), but i'm scared the weight loss is also attributed to lung cancer, because i havent been exercising at all and the weight loss i've experienced is way too much for just 1 and a half months!)

I would go to a doctor, but because it's the weekend and tomorrow i'll have all 4 of my wisdom teeth removed, i won't be able to see a doctor for another whole week. I'm just really scared of unknowingly having or developing terminal cancer. I don't want to die, i have too many plans for my life.

To get back to the title of my post, exactly how justified are my fears??

Edit: If its relevant, ever since i took 1800ml of Ibuprofen every day for a week straight in october last year because of unbearable toothaches attributed to my wisdom teeth, i've been experiencing a lot of digestive issues and acid reflux, as well as heartburn and frequent burping. My stool is also frequently bloody and painful to pass. I've done a blood test and had my urine tested and my doctors didn't find anything wrong, so i had no treatment done. After 3 months still as bad as before..."

A few months ago the later I noticed i was kinda just loopy and tired no matter how much sleep I got or what I was doing during the day.  

Then finally I noticed that a floater developed and thus has now turned into thousands of fucking floaters in my eyes and I have zero idea on what to do. 

All of these symptoms haven’t improved at all and if anything have just gotten worse over the past year.  I have pretty much taken every blood test imaginable and I have no options left.

I'm a 30-year-old, and I've always been shy and introverted. Recent therapy sessions have indicated that I also have social anxiety.  
I've set a goal for myself in the next three months: to reduce my social anxiety and become comfortable with stress-free, impromptu public speaking. One specific idea I've been considering is participating in online discussions or meetings with a group of people to practice speaking in a more relaxed setting.  
Another thought I had is to put myself in a situation where I can experience constructive criticism or even playful teasing, as I believe this might help me overcome my fear by demonstrating that it's not as daunting as it may seem.  
Furthermore, I'm interested in learning the art of debating and becoming more comfortable with vulnerability. Any suggestions or recommendations you could offer would be greatly appreciated. Thank you for your help!"

196r8d4,Anxiety,2024-01-14,"Wondering if I’m dying [TW: mention of cancer, war, smoking]","This is not a post for medical advice or a diagnosis or anything. I’m just getting stuff off my chest.

I (17M) have been dealing with a pretty nasty cough for almost two weeks. Starting tomorrow, it will have been two weeks since it started. I can’t get a doctor’s appointment until at least the 22nd, because it has to have lasted 3 weeks before the doctors do anything about it or check it out.

I’ve been thinking about what it could be. Is it a virus? I don’t think so, because it hasn’t spread to anyone (I’ve been around people at work and school as well as family and nobody else has it). Is it a chest infection? I’m not sure. Is it cancer? Possibly.

It’s been a really nasty cough that rattles my entire chest, brings up phlegm and sometimes sends me lightheaded. I’ve never had this kind of cough before. 

I was weighed at the start of the month so I can use that as a reference to compare if I’ve lost any, because that can be important (especially since I’ve not been trying to lose weight). 

I’ve mainly just been thinking about if I’m going to die, when I’m going to die, what it could be etc. I’ve been trying not to think about it much, but every time I start coughing I feel like it’s probably not something good.

This could be cancer because my mum and sister smoke and so many people from school vape, and I’m not sure how well my lungs are dealing with all these other gases being in them. 

The fact my country (England) is now at war with Yemen doesn’t exactly help me to feel more at ease. I feel like I’m either going to die from whatever is causing this cough or from getting hit with a missile or something.

Sorry for the rant and I hope I didn’t make anybody too upset or afraid."

I was making some progress but caught covid last week which seems to have completely wreck my brain. I have intense brain fog and have been having debilitating anxiety attacks for 5 days now with intense feelings of complete terror and despair. Even watching television feels triggering. This is all so difficult because prior to this spike I was fully functional living a very full happy life with no anxiety and amazing social skills. Now I am a complete shell of my former self it is quite heartbreaking.  
I have an appointment with a doctor tomorrow and am getting a blood test done. What medications should I request? I am looking for something to take the edge off during the day and allow me get back to university and dating/social life. Furthermore I would like an additional medication to help with relaxing at night and allowing me to fall asleep. And ideally not medications which will cause permanent sexual dysfunction. I have also tried a lot of the natural supplements but they dont do much for me besides kava which only has a very mild effect.

196qwts,Anxiety,2024-01-14,"Not sure who needs this or if it will help, but here you go anyway....","The 3rd Monday of the year is supposedly the most depressing. Being that the first Monday was also the first day, Im not sure if this means tomorrow or next week - either way, here are a couple of things that have helped me over the years, that have seen me go from being an anxious wreck to just merely anxious.

I'm in my early forties now and the sad news for me is that the anxiety never really went away, I still live in hope but its more of dance now than the occasionally violent struggle it was even as recent as about 5 years ago.

For me, one of the changes in my mindset that has helped the most was that, as an example, if I were to ask myself (or google) for some answers, I would now reframe the question from ""How do I cure/ get rid of my anxiety?"" to something more like ""How do I continue to live and get the most out of life even though I have anxiety?"".

I don't actually either google or ask myself that actual question, Im using that as an example.... It's a bit of a subtle shift but I attribute the biggest portion to my increase in general happiness to it over anything else. 

I can't quite remember the exact day I gave in and accepted my fate, but I definitely remember the brief period leading up to it - all I can say is that I just wanted the pain to stop. I considered the very permanent option amongst a few others and then came to the conclusion that I couldn't put my family through what would probably be an even greater amount of pain than I figured I was in in comparison and just kind of decided that I would just have to live with it, even if just for their sake.

Around this time, something just kind of lifted. The internal, indescribable pain was still there, but I just kind of acclimatised to it. I still get bouts of anxiety that shake me a bit but they're a bit shorter and less crippling than when it was at its peak.

Basically it's a case of let go a bit and stop fighting it. I know this is a bit like the sort of annoying advice you get from people with no personal experience with anxiety and depression that say things like - ""Just cheer up"", apologies for that but also, give it a try.

The second, also somewhat slightly condescending/ run of the mill piece of advice I have is quite simply 'Defer &amp; Distract'.

I have a few hobbies now, where as before my only hobby was fishing, it got to the stage where I was only going a few times a year and the rest of my life was just tied up with, well, life. Don't get me wrong, things were good overall, I just felt anxious, fearful or depressed for far too much of it. Never a worrier, but always anxious and internally 'worried' about some nameless, imageless entity that just always seemed to creep into every moment.

What I started to do was talk to it. I could even be doing something I enjoy and in the flow or at a family gathering or social event (peak!) but where I was enjoying myself and it would creep in. 

As soon as I noticed it, I would acknowledge it and silently say to it ""You're welcome to come and get me, but you will have to come back later"", I started to do the same with ruminations and intrusive thoughts - instead of seeing them as something I 'created', I see them as something external that roam around looking for victims - I just tell them, they are welcome to have me as their host, but they always have to come back later. 

When later comes as it always does, I just try and stay distracted, all the while acknowledging to Mr Anxiety that he is welcome in to spread his jitters. 

I don't quite know how it works, but it does. I still get the gad feeling, its just nowhere as severe. Its kind of like having a bad knee or back pain - its always there once you've damaged it but by not fighting against it you just kind of get used to it being there.  


As I say, I live in hope, just no longer in desperation for a cure."

Thinking about how currency, countries, and even just human language only has meaning because we give it meaning made life feel very meaningless. I suddenly felt that our perceived reality only makes sense to us and that really freaked me out. None of this information is new to me, so I really don't know why I got so nervous but now I just can't shake the anxiety. I've started over-analyzing every little detail about my existence, asking myself why I make any choice that I do and trying to break down the thought processes in a logical way. It's making it hard to enjoy doing anything. It makes me feel like life is pointless and formulaic. I have OCD so obsessing over things in this way used to be normal for me, which was miserable, but I haven't really done this in 2 - 3 years because of therapy, but now it's just back? I hate it. If anyone knows any coping methods to help me break this compulsive loop, please let me know."
196q77n,Anxiety,2024-01-14,Kinda Weird Thoughts,"This may seem a bit weird. I find it weird as well. About a couple times a month I have this period where I have this uncontrollable thought that says “I love you” and other things along that over and over and over and over again. It’s all positive thoughts which 😭 definitely better than bad ones so I’m grateful I don’t have those. It feels like it’s towards a specific person, but of course it’s not because I do not love anyone in that way. Not only do I have the those thoughts but I also have to PHYSICALLY bite down on something or squeeze something until the episode passes. The episode could last HOURS, or just half an hour. If it happens in public I look like a crazzzzzzyyy person clenching my teeth. Clenching is also not good for my teeth so I try to bite down on something soft when I can. Anyways, the first and only person I told about this was my therapist and she was trying to connect it with anxiety but overall doesn’t know wtf is going on.

 Anxiety is really weird, so I was wondering if anyone else has experienced something similar. I’ve tried looking at some stuff online but I honestly don’t even know what to search. Thanks for reading!

Idk what to do anymore. I’m 19 but I feel like life is just getting worse. I want to live but I don’t know how much longer I can put up with this. My anxiety and depression have just been so bad.

196q0hf,Anxiety,2024-01-14,How can I make my parents understand my anxiety disorder better?,"Talking to my family about my mental health is a very difficult topic. I've been suffering from undiagnosed SAD since around 7th grade and finally reached out and got professional help only recently. I was diagnosed with mixed anxiety disorder and have gone through therapy and meds for more than half a year now. My anxiety disorder has always been a huge part of my life. It wrecks me, it's spiraling, you know how it feels and how it hugely impacts your day-to-day life. My folks do support me in my effort to get better, but it doesn't feel real and they often act as if everything is fine and nothing's wrong with me. They often ask about my day and we talk about stuff but they never touch the subject and when I try to talk, it makes them uncomfortable, and always avoid talking about it, sometimes even by changing the subject and cutting me.

I want to trust my parents and family that they truly understand and support me with my condition. But no matter how hard I try and be clear with them, we're always going around and around. What I get from them is that it's very clear that they keep getting it the wrong way and don't try to understand it at all. They do try their best to be supportive but it feels fake to me. It's actually okay if they don't quite understand my condition. Most of the time I don't understand it myself. All I need is the support that feels real to me from my family, 

Is anyone here with the same experience? if so how was it? I could use some advice. thanks"
196pzae,Anxiety,2024-01-14,Can anxiety make your right side of face feel heavy/off?,"Hello, I've been having this issue with my right side of face always feeling heavy, I feel like it's heavy/drooping but when I look to the mirror I don't have any major assymetries, the issue started when I was very anxious about getting rejected from a job opportunity 4 years ago, this lead to a spiral of anxiety about the new sensations I've been getting on the right side of my face basically but occasionally on my right limbs, at first I went to a GP that said it might related to migraines, checked my heart and said everything is fine. After a few months I mustered the courage and went to a neurologist, she checked me I remember having tremors on my right side, she described it as unilteral oversensitivity and gave me a brain MRI, the brain MRI was clear so I didn't go to the followup with her thinking that I'm okay and I hate doctors so much so that was enough to ease my anxiety back then. I have a right foot that would sometimes feel numb too I got it checked and aside from varicose veins I was cleared of any major issues (I also found out that my right foot is bigger than the left foot which made it more sore after wearing shoes), I'd sometimes wake up with a swollen right hand so I went to a cardiologist about it and he cleared me of any issues, I went to an internalist, I did a comprehensive blood test and urine protenuria test of 24 hours, my tests came back negative of any abnormalities. I've been so anxious about going back to the neurologist because that was 3 years ago and I'm so anxious that I might've ruined myself by not going back to her back then, can you please reassure me if anyone experienced this due to anxiety?"

I don't know if it gets worst when I'm moving or if it's in my imagination or something. The doctors have explained to me that since I'm so young (21) and the only risk factor I have currently is high blood pressure (Which also takes years to affect you) that a heart attack isn't even a factor for years to come at best. I'm trying to not freak out and quit bothering the poor people at the ER but I'm starting to become a bit of a nervous wreck. I don't know what I could have done to cause this, maybe I slept on it or something but I'm just hoping to hear from someone who's been down this same path as me."

I try to not think of my mother but that is impossible. I never dealt with things like this of course the events of my grandmother passing of cancer sent me on the health anxiety way but i had one panic attack also i was drinking at the time so that might have triggers it but i did not have any after that  and eventually i overcame it but it was still deep down still inside me. The passing of my grandfather was a tear shedding accepting of things to come and I was in peace that he is in peace but as to my mother passing unexpectedly rocked my world. I could not accept the fact that she is gone. I keep struggling with it 2 months after then unexpectedly my little cousin passed away which kept me in that state for a while.

I've had it for a few years and it only intensified after the loss of my senior dog a few months ago. However, it's just this weird feeling where I just feel like I'm automatic and my mind just feels strange but it's not like depression, sometimes it makes me overthink the world and stuff like death, evil everywhere, the afterlife, etc and it sends me spiraling. It could be something like depersonalization but it's not that I don't feel real + I don't feel detached from myself, my mind is just kind of foggy and unfeeling until the nighttime which is when I just bawl my eyes out for whatever reason.

196ms72,Anxiety,2024-01-14,Constant lightheadedness &amp; Anxiety,"Sorry about the long post but I just have to talk to someone about this. 29M here. So about 8 years ago I randomly had my first panic attack out of no where and I thought I was having a heart attack. I was out at lunch with a co-worker and he took me to the ER. They did a bunch of tests and didn't find anything wrong. For the next several months to a year I was in and out of ERs and it was determined that I had GAD. My doctor prescribed prozac for me and it was a hard first two months then things finally started getting better slowly. The worst part was that I was a perfectly normal person before that panic attack, then afterwards I was a complete mess. That was for sure adding to the anxiety. Fast forward a bit and I eventually weened off of the prozac because for the most part I was feeling better and didn't like relying on medicine. For the most part I was great for years with slight bits of anxiety here and there. 

&amp;#x200B;

About a month ago I had just started feeling better from being sick and I had a horrible vertigo attack in the middle of the night and the whole next day I couldn't even move without getting physically sick and vomiting. I had my wife drive me to urgent care and they didn't see any red flags for anything serious so I was prescribed some medicine for vertigo/nausea and sent home. When I woke up the next day I felt completely better and went to work with no issues for weeks. Then right after Christmas, I got Covid which didn't even really affect me but I stayed home from work for the week so I wouldn't get anyone else sick. Fast forward to a week ago and I started to slowly get this feeling of being lightheaded 24/7. I dismissed it at first and hoped one day I'd wake up and it would be gone... well it hasn't gone away and actually has gotten worse. Today has been the worst day by far and I feel so exhausted. I'm not sure if its actual fatigue or just mental exhaustion from all of this. I'm going to call my Dr. tomorrow to get an appt. Just looking for some help or someone that has gone through something similar.

To add to this it doesn’t help that I started a new job where I’m helping build a company which is a bit stressful. The insurance obviously isn’t that great with it being a high deductible insurance so I’m worried about dr appts and money because we live paycheck to paycheck. I also have a 2 year old boy that I’m trying to help raise and worried my condition won’t allow for me to help as much as I want to. And I want our family to be ok and not get into trouble because of my weird medical issues as I am the primary income in the household by far. 

The common theme to this is worry I think. I want to believe I’m ok but it’s hard to believe that with all of my anxiety. "
196mpme,Anxiety,2024-01-14,Is this just my anxiety acting up??,"Chest pain, PVC and Bradycardia? Could it be from anxiety??

30 year old female, moderate alcohol use (weekends 5 ish drinks), previously vaped nicotine for 3 years and quit 2 weeks ago. 

Two weeks ago I went to the ER with chest pain on my left side. They ran an EKG, chest X-rays, and Troponin bloodwork. Everything came back completely normal. 

I then started Prozac (20mg) for ongoing general anxiety - I took it for five days before I started experiencing Bradycardia with a resting heart rate of 32-49. I went to emergency again and the doctor told me to get off ASAP. They took bloodwork to look at my electrolytes, thyroid function and hormones and everything was perfect. The EKG showed that I have Trigeminy. My blood pressure was 120/89. 

I’m still having the chest pain which also moves to my back (between shoulder blade and spine) on my left side. The pain feels internal, almost like a quick muscle cramp (sharp squeeze) that happens for about a second and then goes away. This happens intermittently all day. Nothing seems to make it better or worse. I’ve tried Asprin, Aleve, Advil, and Tylenol and none seem to cut the pain. It doesn’t feel muscular or like a nerve because movement and positional changes don’t seem to affect it. Deep breathing doesn’t make it worse.

I did see a chiropractor last week and the pain went away for a few days but it back again. He took X-rays and said everything looked fine with my spine and hips. 

I just don’t know what to do about the pain. Both emergency room doctors had no answers for me and it’s making my health anxiety skyrocket."

It was a normal time at the airport, I had a Burger King, towards the end of the flight I vomited a little bit and then when we got to our hotel I vomited a lot more. On the flight back I was totally fine. My brain now associates flying with vomiting and the thought of flying again makes me very worried. This was almost ten years ago, I’m not motion sick or travel sick as I’ve been driven all around my country and Europe aswell. 

I would love to start flying again but I’m obviously very worried about vomiting, can anyone help alleviate my worry because I want to be able to travel the world.

I had Migraines, Gerd, Depression, Anxiety, etc before my panic attacks began around a year ago.  A year ago, I finished my MA and got hit with Shingles.  These are the high points at least.  A few days later I had distored vision, veins buldging out of arm, couldn't breathe, called 911 and 8 hrs later, hospital said panic attack.  Even though this happened I was fine.  
Two weeks later, It happened again, and again (because I was sick and so was my cat).  After this I had no appetite, couldn't sleep, lost 20 pounds, was generally in a bad place so I moved in with family.  A family member passed over the summer which spawned an attack and some episodes but I was mostly fine.  I stayed busy with chores, hobbies, movies and tv shows, just doing things.    
Then winter and December came.  I was put on Buspirone for Gerd and well, this was a horrible time.  I am coming off of this now, but I either have no appetite still or I do have one and when I eat (literally anything) boom GERD.  I have lost 11 pounds.  I know most of this is anxiety but when everything comes back up, even water, i cough and its in my mouth, well its hard to believe its only anxiety.  Its hard to get out of bed and really do anything.  I just don't know what to do.  I am taking all my ususal meds but life just sucks.

196lry6,Anxiety,2024-01-14,Cut ties with toxic people and Im anxious,"

So long story short , a year and a bit ago, I finally realized that my friend group of about 4 years was extremely toxic. I started to distance myself from them and finally in early 2023 I stopped talking to them altogether. It culminated in about April/May when they confronted me because I had sort of ghosted them and refused to explain why I cut ties and then in that moment I gave my reasoning and never talked to them again and everything seemed to go well.

The thing is, when I cut them off, I was still part of a bunch of old gcs that they had added me to over time. As the months went by I gained the courage to leave those that were completely inactive, this made me feel proud of myself as if I was doing something meaningful. However, I didn't dare to leave a couple of them where they still spoke like once every few months. I know this doesn't sound significant but it intimidated me.

Today, finally I did it. Im partially very relieved because that was messing with my mental health big time, but on the other hand Im also very anxious right now.

Im scared of their reaction. Most of all im scared that they might want to retaliate. I know this sounds completely nonsensical. To be clear, I dont fear for my safety, I just fear that they might want to get back at me in some way or form

Again, I know this sounds crazy but I just really need some sound and rational voices to guide me."

&amp;#x200B;

So i have had Heath anxitey since last year after getting GERD, thinking im going to have a heart attack or a stroke. i was perscribed propranolol 10mg 2x day to help with the physical anxiety feelings i would get. It helped for the most part, i got some pains still but kept myself calm and was able to do things.   


My Perscription was a 40MG tab as 10MG tabs were backordered, and i would cut up the 40MG into quarters. A week ago they got 10MG tabs and gave me this. i was taking 10MG ONCE a day for the most part because i thought 2x a day might be too much and was working. I decided with this fill i would do  the proper 10mg x2. ever since then my anxitey and physical feelngs are the highest they have ever been. i went to ER with fainting/werid chest feelings/palpitations/numbness in arm, and was cleared and upped it to 20MG x2 day. after i left the ER i had a full blown panic attack with the tightest chest pain ever. I went home right away and had the 20mg. after an hour having that i almost passed out a few times and freaked out but slept it off. woke up the next day and had one 10mg and went back to the ER with the same symptoms and mentioning i am having some memory issues and stumbling with my words sometimes, and did tests again and was told to go back to just 10mg once a day, talked to crisis worker who referred me to a clinic ill get a call from next week. I called the pharmacy and they are going to give me the original 40MG tabs for me to cut up as i was fine on thoese, and she thinks i might be havinga  reaction to the fillers or coloring. slowly every day it gets a bit better but im still feeling these things, last night i went to see a cousin i never met, was fine for a a few hours, then had a full blown panaic attack i had to stay outside to calm down then go home.  


has anyone ever had this happen to them?"

196hjw6,Anxiety,2024-01-14,24/7 Bounding Pulse - forceful heartbeat (19M),"Hi everyone, this symptom which everyone tells me is anxiety has been ruining my life for 3 months now, at rest i can feel a strong pulse in the left side of my chest, in the mirror my neck pulse and collarbone pulse is more visible.

It gets a lot worse upon immediately standing then calms down, stairs make my heart pound, and exercise makes it go insane, it all started from a number of events:
1. A bad edibles trip which landed me in the ER, 
2. Since then I had two viral infections that had me ill for a week each
3. Then smoking one puff of weed about 2 weeks later set this pulse off. 

I’ve had a heart monitor, bloodwork, echo and chest x ray all normal, heart rate and bp are fine apart from BP rises when i stand by 6/7 systolic.

I’ve also noticed it gets a little better after paracetamols and magnesium glycinate (100mg) for a short time, and immediately after exercising it calms down to barely noticeable. It’s also gotten better over the months, it used to shake my body when I slept and I couldn’t sleep on my left side for weeks, now it’s not that noticeable at rest anymore but it’s still there.

The only other symptoms I have which started at the same time are random short lived zappy chest pains usually when walking, a tight gut/abdomen whenever I walk that is really uncomfortable and headaches sometimes when I stand up, and also cracks in my chest and back when I breath in sometimes, and neck cracks all the time.

Any comments are appreciated."
196hi70,Anxiety,2024-01-14,Chronic anxiety causing sleep problems,"Anxiety advices

I have mainly extrasystoles, I did EKGs 3 times, nothing unusual (in the last they found isolated supraventricular extrasystoles which are benign) and also echocardiography 5 years ago. I have also sore throat and I've lost majority of my smelling because of a persistant rhinitis (resistant to the treatments so far I have to go back to the physician...)

What are your advices to manage anxiety ? Also books etc. that could help 

I have anxious habits where I would go to see the news of accident etc. but thankfully I stopped mainly with that (though it began again today). Then, I invented myself also many diseases which I didn't have : epilepsy, cancer, diabetes etc., this part is mainly behind me also. 

My anxiety caused me heavy sleep problems too, I'm always so tired.... I have irregular sleep schedules too"
196hfyt,Anxiety,2024-01-14,Dealing with work anxiety,"Ever since I started working a desk job since few months ago, my anxiety levels seems to always spike thru the roof. My heart just keeps pounding off my chest for my whole 9hr shift 6 days a week. I got social anxiety so it even gets worse whenever my coworkers try to talk to me or invite me after office hours to hangout.

I also get mini-panic attacks at night whenever I get reminded by something work related and i kept loosing sleep then every morning I dreaded going to back work. 

I don't even feel relaxed even on weekends too. I get so anxious whenever I receive a work mail on my only day off and even if I don't read it, my heart just start pounding off. 

The thing is, work is not really that bad. Tasks are quite easy. But I don't know if it's just in my head cause my social anxiety is kicking in but I feel everyone is hostile against me. I never feel like I belong there. And it's making me super anxious, just existing. It feels suffocating. And I fear if this continues I might even develop hypertension.

I need some advice how to handle work anxiety working in a toxic environment but I can't quit cause I needed the money and I fear that if I quit I might just isolate myself again and crawl back to my hellhole. But I also don't like feeling like shit all the time.

Weirdly enough, I'm getting anxious just typing this. Usually I vent to reddit to let off steam and calm me down, but i'm getting more riled up. I should stop now, I feel like I'm gonna have a heart attack just thinking and sharing something work related.

What's wrong with me?"

196gww8,Anxiety,2024-01-14,I did the dumbest thing yesterday.,"So I've been on a good 2 month streak of no issues. Mostly this has been due to SSRI medication. Welp yesterday I thought it would be a great idea to take 10mg of edibles. Within 30minutes I was already extremely stoned and it just kept going and going until I started feeling tight at the chest and having heart palpitations. Blood pressure was 160/101 so that made me feel even worse so I called 911. 

I explained my symptoms like high blood pressure, dizzy, difficulty breathing etc. etc.  but also said I have a history of panic attacks so its hard to tell if this is real or not. I felt so embarrassed but they said that they can check on me no problem just to make sure. They arrived and saw my vitals getting better overtime and left by saying to call them if I feel bad again. They were very nice to me but the embarrassment was so much that I could barely even look them in the eye. 

Even after they left though I kept having waves of panic attacks. Body was shaking a bunch and I my mind was overwhelmed. Felt like I couldn't even breath but my brother checked up on me and we had my dad on speaker (My father also suffered from anxiety) to talk to me until I felt better.

Just needed to vent somewhere. That was incredibly dumb to take edibles lol. God that was intense.

196gsgm,Anxiety,2024-01-14,Personal Story - What Helped My anxiety &amp; Insomnia,"I just wanted to share some things that worked for me. None of this may work for you, but it’s my unique  experience that may help one of you.
 
BACKGROUND: I am currently 38 years old. My sleep problems started when I was 36; prior to that, I never had issues. I have been in 3 total-loss accidents (none my fault), one of which was pretty traumatic and included hitting a drunk pedestrian. I went through a bit of a stressful time in my job when promoted to a supervisor and had a bad breakup about 4 years ago. When I turned 36, I started having panic attacks, an increased heart rate, raised blood pressure, and problems breathing, which I had never had before. As a result, I visited the emergency room at least 4 times. One time I thought I was going to die it was so bad. At work once I started shaking uncontrollably and went to the bathroom till it resolved. I developed terrible insomnia and some nights could only sleep 1-2 hours. Every time things checked out, but a few times I did have higher albumin and low potassium. My insomnia could be anxiety-related. I wanted to mention I was taking drugs for hair loss for a few years too—finasteride and minoxidil—and those could’ve been a factor. No other medications or supplements. No hormone issues. Testosterone was 690 and the thyroid was healthy according to bloodwork.

WHAT WORKED: How I arrived where I did would be too long, so I will cut to the chase. You can ask questions if interested in further details. First I stopped taking all medications. Then I cut out all sugar except honey and changed my diet to mostly plant-based, with small servings of chicken or salmon each day. I eat lots of potassium and magnesium in my diet and low salt (1,500mg). I strive for 1.6g protein per kg weight. I stopped eating 3 hours before bed. I added a multivitamin without large daily percentages of nutrients and taking vitamin D (1,000 IU). I started working out 3X week.  I started doing the sauna three times a week at my gym- this really helped calm the anxiety issues. While all of these things helped my anxiety, I still had insomnia issues and waking up at night. Sleep apnea was not a thought as I always breath fine, just restlessness constantly. It wasn’t until one day when I ate a bunch of tofu (which I never ate before) from a local restaurant around me while out with a friend (Bibipop). That night, I slept okay. The next day I got the same meal again with 1-2 cups of tofu and felt a wave of relaxation. I took 2-3 naps about 1-2 hours that day, and then a full 9 hours of sleeping that night without waking up once. I don’t normally eat out much anymore so I bought some tofu and now incorporate 1/2 cup or so into my main meal of the day. For the past 4 months, I have been sleeping very good like when I was young. I feel relaxed with steady energy, and my anxiety has lessened greatly. My blood pressure hovers around 115/70. I feel good and at peace and will continue this regimen. I am perplexed at what happened exactly. The spiritual side of me points to the grace of god relieving my issues. I am thankful either way."
196g5ba,Anxiety,2024-01-14,Changing times I take my anxiety medication,"I was just curious, if I’m going to change the time I take my Lexapro (normally 7am) to nighttime do I basically double dose or do I just not take my normal dose and wait until it’s nighttime? I currently take 20 mgs of lexapro daily"
196fyz4,Anxiety,2024-01-14,Stuttering and imbalance during and after having a panic attack?,"I’m 37 (F) and I was diagnosed with generalized anxiety as a young teen. The kind of panic attacks I’m accustomed to are the palpitations, hyperventilating, heaviness in my chest, sometimes uncontrollable crying. etc.

Now, when I experience panic attacks, it’s so much worse. I experience everything I described above and more…it’s so intense, I start screaming so loud while crying hysterically. I also stutter.

I never stuttered in my life until the middle of last year. It lingers for a while then after a couple hours, I can talk normally. Then of course, I get very sleep cuz I feel drained. 

It terrifies my family and I hate when it happens in front of them.

My mother is also in the ICU in critical condition. She’s been there since New Year’s Eve, and will be for weeks, a month possibly. 

I didn’t have a specific trigger at the time of my panic attack. I was talking and laughing with my family when it happened. But I obviously am very sad and stressed about my mom and haven’t had adequate sleep. 

The weird thing is a few hours later, I suddenly got so tired and I had no balance walking. I had a spinal fusion a few months ago (along with some unfortunate complications from the procedure), so I do use a cane,  but I typically walk pretty well. Last night, I kept falling over and stumbling, and someone would have to help me walk. My family said I looked drunk. Lol. 

Anyone else experience these symptoms? (Regardless of going through difficult circumstances) Especially the stuttering? My psychiatrist said if this persists for over a year each time I have a panic attack, I may need speech therapy. 

Just wanted some insight if anyone can relate. Thanks in advance."
196fu51,Anxiety,2024-01-14,How do you deal with GAD?,"Although i think I have been suffering from it since 2021, since last august my live has been a living hell! I cant do anything! 24/7 focused in this shit, with constant psyshical symptons and constant fear of diying! Cant do anything that increases my heartbeat because I have developed cardiophobia! No sex, no sports. I am now even afraid of walking. Before brintellix, i could not even sit to rest! I was walking almost the  entire day!

196fhl7,Anxiety,2024-01-14,Tips on how to overcome fear of Doctor / White Coat Syndrome?,"I seem to have picked up an extreme fear of doctors after going through a major health anxiety spell a few years ago.  I went from running to the doctor for everything, to now having a phobia and avoiding going at all.  This is all due in large part to experiencing high blood pressure readings or white coat hypertension while in the office.  A couple of bad experiences with misunderstanding nurses and providers making the situation worse has led me here.  My BP readings at home are normal.

I have an issue that needs further evaluation by a specialist and possibly surgery.  The thought of going to the Doctor makes me freak.  I feel like my body is going to collapse in on itself from the sheer anxiety.  I have no control over my extreme physiological response and the ensuing panic that kicks in when the blood pressure cuff comes out. I feel completely hopeless.  How do I get a handle on a response I have no control over? 
 
Has anyone been able to overcome this or can offer advice?  Would taking a benzo before the appointment help reduce the panic/anxiety?   I feel trapped and without control."

196fb3y,Anxiety,2024-01-14,My Journey to healing,"Hey everyone,

After lurking for a while 👀, I felt it was time to share my story and some encouragement. This community has been a lifeline during a challenging period for me.

About me:
36/M living in Sweden

During the spring, my 4-year-old son had a health scare, initially suspected as lymphoma but turned out to be a severe viral infection. Simultaneously, my uncle, my dad’s identical twin, battled aggressive stage 4 esophageal cancer and passed away in September. This triggered extreme anxiety for me.

Over the following months, I found myself obsessing over health concerns, especially cancer. In October, after extensive work travel, I experienced a breakdown with extreme panic attacks with shaking and sweating, loss of appetite and 8kg weight loss over 2 weeks, diarrhea, heart rate through the roof….overall misery. Convinced I had colon cancer, I finally sought help despite my anxiety about visiting the doctor.

I did all the medical tests which came back fine only to find out that other tests revealed I had Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) and Health Anxiety (HA). Also, through talking with my family I found out that everyone in my immediate family has an anxiety disorder…looking back I should have been on a medication and in therapy 15-20 years ago. I started on zoloft/sertraline(100mg), and am undergoing Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), and integrated helpful resources like the DARE app (SOS part has been amazing). The first 2 weeks on setraline were wild. I felt like I was white knuckling my way through the day and by the night I was singing kumbaya and at peace with the universe. I’m now in week 8 and I feel very normal in a good way. 

My message to you all:

Anxiety can feel overwhelming, but you can regain control. It’s a journey, and each day offers choices to nurture anxiety or your well-being. While we can’t predict life’s challenges, there’s hope and effective treatments that shift us from reactive to responsive. Act now, cherish life, and experience each moment. Sending love to you all."

This is not the first time this has happened during a medical situation and there is always a small part of my brain yelling at me that I’m being completely irrational but this larger part of my brain is in fight or flight mode and I just flip out completely. 
I’m going to feel like absolute shit for days now as I try and process it all."

I ran for a cold bubbly to catch my breath and  I got in the shower and still feel like I’m having air hunger  now. 

This happened a few months ago too.

I honestly feel so drained everyday and I can’t seem to shift it no matter what I do. I thought it was something medical because I’ve been feeling this way for about 6 months but they can’t seem to find anything. I know I do experience anxiety often and daily, but I never knew it could make you feel this bad! I’m finding it really hard to even go about my day. I don’t even particularly have anything to worry about, but I suppose I am worrying about feeling like this predominantly. I do have a more GAD sort of anxiety issue just for context as well. 

Has anyone else ever felt like this, and overcome it? I used to be a lot more energetic and I miss that, and also wish I was less anxious in general all the time like I am now. I would assume maybe I have burnt myself out or am experiencing adrenal fatigue from anxiety?"
196bgw9,Anxiety,2024-01-14,Memory gaps?,"So I decided to confront some friends about feeling shitty for a while and how it had made my anxiety worse than it’s ever been. They both (even the neutral one) was like “yeah you’re the one who has been rude and snapping at us lately” and I just don’t remember this at all and it’s scaring me. How can my anxiety be so insistent on seeing things from a specific point of view, that it’ll make me have literal gaps in my memory when they don’t fit the anxiety’s narrative??

Anyways if any of you guys have any experience with this and have some suggestions on what to do moving forward (cause now I don’t trust my own memory) then that would be really appreciated!"

It’s almost a feeling like I’m high but not exactly and as if I need to shake my head to sort of snap out of it. I tried my best to look it up and the closest thing I got was brain fog but I don’t really have the memory/slow thoughts/confusion issues. I just feel like I’m not fully there and it’s kind of hazy. Anyone else have this feeling before and any tips on what I should do?"

196auzz,Anxiety,2024-01-14,Anxiety causing physical symptoms,Can anxiety cause physical symptoms even when I'm not feeling anxious? I've been having an iffy stomach for the last while and i was wondering if it could be because of my anxiety. I've recently been through a lot of stress and also upped my dose of Sertraline from 100mg to 150mg if those could be factors. Kinda worried I've got like a kidney or liver problem
196aqyi,Anxiety,2024-01-14,Potentially unpopular views on anxiety recovery/management,"I speak from both my personal experience with anxiety (specifically health anxiety) and as a psych grad student studying to be a therapist.  First of all, note my use of the term ""management.""  I don't believe in aiming for a cure.  While some people may experience permanent remission, it is in no way an assured or reliably attainable outcome.  I (and most clinicians) prefer to think of anxiety as a more chronic condition that can be well managed to allow one to live a normal and fulfilling life, but not necessarily eliminated entirely.    

This subreddit (and most of the internet) seems to mostly favor what I will call the radical acceptance approach citing the likes of Claire Weekes or Michelle Cavanaugh (who are not pychologists but primary care doctors with a personal interest in mental health).  And proponents often use terms like ""allowing"" ""don't fight it,"" or ""floating.""  However, I've found this useless at best and triggering at worst as an initial intervention.  I understand this as an extreme passivity approach of doing literally nothing and hoping the anxiety will just magically go away on its own.  This would also seem to require buddhist monk levels of mental discipline to experience such distress and accept it without taking any steps to relieve it.  From my experience, anxiety recovery is a very active process that involves learning new, more constructive ways of coping with that anxiety.  While doing nothing is certainly better than doing safety behaviors such as googling or checking in the case of health anxiety, I think it's even better to also do other things positively impact anxiety and mental health like meditation, breathwork, journaling, yoga, exercise, etc.  These things have helped me a lot.  And yet, many in the RA crowd seem to look down on anything that is actively done for the purpose of relieving anxiety and see crutches (with negative connotation) rather than tools.  Cherellethinks (ex HA sufferer turned licensed therapist) puts it best, consistent use of anxiety tools (even and especially when you're not actively anxious) creates an emotional cushion of sorts over time so that when something does trigger you again, the resulting anxiety is less severe and easier to deal with than before.  

In addition, I find the line between ""allowing"" my anxiety thoughts and dwelling/ruminating on them to be so thin as to be basically non existent.  The way I cope is by recognizing my disordered thought patterns and dismissing them as such.  If I don't give those thoughts my attention and energy, they'll eventually go away.  Trying to consciously ""allow"" them is just unnecessarily giving them the time of day and leads to fixation and rumination for me.  I believe this is the traditional CBT method.  Doing that in conjunction with other anxiety tools helps me clear my head and think more rationally.  

Ultimately, I think acceptance in anxiety recover is the same as the acceptance stage of grief.  Note that acceptance is the very last stage that is only possible after you've fully worked through and processed everything.  It's the same for anxiety, I believe one has to learn to manage one's anxiety before being potentially able to enter the acceptance stage.  Therefore, preaching acceptance to someone who has no hold on their anxiety whatsoever or an insufficient hold on their anxiety is extremely unhelpful if not frustrating.  What people at that stage really need are coping and management tools.  Finally, RA isn't ""the"" way out of anxiety (I would argue there isn't one due to all the differing therapeutic approaches that exist).  While some may find RA helpful, I don't think it's for everyone.  Different approaches work differently for different people.  There's no right or wrong way to deal with anxiety if it leads you to a content and fulfilled life.  I hope this helps others like myself who found all the RA talk unhelpful."
196anir,Anxiety,2024-01-14,Lightheaded when anxious,"Iv’e been getting lightheaded when Im anxious recently. I think it is anxiety related because it goes away as soon as I get home. For example, the other day I was leaving work and I was feeling anxious making me lightheaded. I drove home like this and I was so scared I was going to pass out. As soon as I got home I was good as new and felt back to normal. I was just wondering if this is normal ? This has happened to me mostly when I go out, never at home.  Should I get my eyes checked ? My vision is fine but Iv’e also never gotten my eyes checked in general. I got my blood checked a few weeks a go and I was vitamin D deficienct for god knows how long. I am at a 7 when i’m supposed to be between 20-30 so im not sure if that is why ? I got put on a prescription for vitamin D for the next 3 months. The lightheadedness is on and off. The last time this happened to me was 4 months ago. Is this normal ? Not on meds."
196abxe,Anxiety,2024-01-14,how do i break out of this bad habit?,"i’ve had really bad anxiety for a few years but recently it’s been getting worse. i don’t like being alone and my anxiety gets extremely more worse at night. i think i preemptively give myself an anxiety/panic attack thinking that something will happen at night where i can’t get ahold of anyone for support because i rely so heavily on others. 

i’ve been having to sleep on the phone with my friend and my boyfriend so in case i have an anxiety attack or something happens, i have someone. i hate this because it causes me to rely so heavily on others and it has also put me in uncomfortable situations like right now where my friend won’t stop making out with her boyfriend and giggling. they said they don’t care that i’m on the phone with them so that’s on them but it’s still an uncomfortable situation and it sucks. 

i’ve tried having a lot of sleepovers with my boyfriend while he is here in town because we are long distance but he leaves in two days to go back to school. 

i really don’t like being alone and i was able to break out of this habit by force a long time ago but unfortunately it came back and i don’t think i can by force anymore. 

i really hate feeling like this and i don’t want to keep feeling like this. 

can anyone give me some advice or has anyone been in this kind of situation and can give me some tips on how to fix this?"

I haven’t had a check up in like 5 years and I’m scared to get told that something is wrong with me. It scares me even more cause I recently just visited an aunt who has been diagnosed with cancer and she was telling me how it runs in the family and then I thought about how other health problems run in the family on my mom’s side. I’m just so scared and I know, it’s better to know early on than knowing later, but it’s just the fear of just hearing that something is wrong period. How do I get over this and just go?"

196a22q,Anxiety,2024-01-14,Worst part of a panic attack,Why does no one tall about this?? Too me the worst part about panic attacks is the fear of it lasting forever. Think about it. Theres no specific reason why it happening. You dont know when it will end. A few minutes feel like forever. And theres that feeling of. What if this is how people go crazy. Even tho it's impossible to be in a panic attack forever it's still and eerie thing to think about. Imagine the feeling never leaving and doctors not knowing what to do with you. Ocd and panic attacks are a match from hell
1969klo,Anxiety,2024-01-14,my alarm system went off for no reason and now I’m afraid I’m not alone,"could just be my anxiety but anyways.

I’m home alone tonight and had turned on my alarm a few hours ago. I like to stay up late so was just chilling in the living room watching TV when the alarm by the front door starts beeping. I go to turn it off and it says the side door is open (which triggered it to go off). I can see the side door from where I’m standing and it’s definitely closed and locked, but I’m afraid someone somehow got inside, locked it, and went into the basement (the basement door is next to the side door) without me hearing. it’s kind of dumb for me think that since the alarm actively said the side door was open when I could see it was not, but idk. what do you think? could it be a glitch? an issue with the alarm’s sensor of knowing when a door is open or not? it’s really cold and windy outside but idk if that affects anything. to my knowledge this has never happened before."

It kinda felt like I didn’t know that’s what I looked like, or just questioning if that was really me? Has anyone experienced this? Is there a term for it lol? Seriously, what an off-putting emotion."

So I (23F) suffer with emetophobia, and whenever I feel sick or nauseous I’ll start to get incredibly panicky because of my fear - but not in the sense that my breathing becomes erratic, my heart races, dizziness etc. I’ll start to feel really, really sick and can’t tell if I’m going to puke or not. I start feeling really sleepy too, I was just sat next to the toilet and I kept dozing off. My stomach rumbles and hurts. I feel like I have to be completely still and I can’t open my mouth or I’ll be sick.

I guess I’m just asking if anyone else gets panic attacks with these kinds of symptoms? I’ve never had a panic attack where I can’t breathe etc, it’s always been this since I can remember. I’ve just come down from an especially bad one (took some medication and the side effects made me feel rough, therefore triggering my emetophobia). 

Thanks so much in advance, just want to know if I’m the only one or not because quite frankly it feels scary and like nobody understands what I’m going through 😩"

I guess I try to explain it with these health conditions to try and figure it out like cardiac arrhythmias and issues, pulmonary stuff, unirary tract and kidney stuff, sepsis, and everything you can think of I’m not exaggerating(and yes I always have all the symptoms).

 I don’t understand I feel like I get past worrying about one then jump to another then I start feeling like I’m close to being done with everything and then it all repeats. Every day at least 3 hours of research on what I worry about. I just want to make it to like 25. Ideally I want a family and all that but I feel like I’m wishing for too much. Every day my wishes to live get shorter like I could just want to live till the end of the year by next month.

19684cj,Anxiety,2024-01-14,"Need help, unexpected trauma from real images of abuse in mainstream movie","I watched a movie called ""Ricochet"" yesterday (1991, Denzel Washington, Jon Lithgow), and there's something massively disturbing in one scene and I don't understand why I can't find a single Reddit comment anywhere talking about it.  
There is a scene where a man is found hanging, with a forged suicide note (framed for being a molester), and there is a shot of an paedophilic adult magazine in a suitcase. When it showed the magazine cover, I was shocked because the images of kids on there looked real.  
I did some research and found out that in the UK cut of Ricochet, that shot of the magazine was removed, due to a 'compulsory cut due to indecent images of children'.  
This means the images were real right? It really upset me and I couldn't sleep at all last night, I don't understand why it would be ok for a mainstream movie like that to contain illegal images. I feel sick to my stomach and angry that I was exposed to it.  
I spent all of yesterday and today so far in serious heightened anxiety and borderline depression. I just want to forget about what I saw. It's not just the images themselves that are bothering me, but I feel bad for the kids in the photos. No idea whether they used a real illegal adult magazine for the shot, or created a fake one with real images, but either way it's deeply upsetting.  
Any help or advice would be hugely appreciated, thank you."

but sadly I'm not making much money with it, so i have to resort to get a normal 9-5 job, but... the tought of getting a low wage, high work 9-5 job feels scary and i have never had a normal job at 22 soo i feel like i'm going to be made fun of in interviews, also the feeling of making my boss rich while I slave my ass off for crumbs makes me annoyed, 

I have a dream to become wealthy have my own business or live off assets not because I'm a materialistic person but rather  I want the freedom to do whatever I want whenever I want and be able to have a comfortable life for me and my close relatives but nothing luxurious tho, I'm a simple person 10k a month would be enough for me. 

But more on the topic of the title any advice for someone who has never worked a normal job at such late age and what unqualified jobs  might be the best for someone who wants to have as minimal work as possible, One that came to my mind is Working at a library or a bookstore but interested in your suggestions"
1967mpd,Anxiety,2024-01-14,Doctors,"So I have an appointment Monday morning with my primary care (new patient, also HATE the doctors) anyways I’m also petrified to take meds. But I’m willing to trust what the doctor says and trying different things. My anxiety I would say is more social/stressed based. I get really anxious inside of stores, restaurants and large gathers like concerts and other events. The reason I’m going to the doctor is to hopefully figure out this and solve it and be able to have a decent quality of life. It gotten me to the point to where I have to take unpaid leave from work for the week til Monday because I’m just so filled with anxiety at work. (6 months project I was comfortable at ended and moved me and it got worst). So I have two questions. One, if you are petrified of the doctors what do you do to help ease you during your 30-40min visit? Also, any miracle drugs that essentially improved your quality of life and helped you start living again? Less than 2 years ago I would have went sky diving without second thoughts or impulsively went to a concert. Now I can even sit at a dinner with my family in public or even go to the grocery store without being consumed.

1967ayc,Anxiety,2024-01-14,I've been fearing for my life for about a year now and it's mainly due to religion and world events,"I'm 19 (20 next month) and I've been consistently anxious about anything related to politics or world events to the point that even hearing the word war or any kind of political shit has caused me to spiral into full blown anxiety attacks. Lately it's started to get better since I saw less and less bad things from actively shielding myself from seeing any sort of news related stuff, but lately some stuff has been seeping through the cracks and it's getting worse and worse.

Since I was a kid my dad has always told me that I wouldn't even live past 13 because the rapture and the end of the world would probably take us, or we'd go through the tribulation and be killed for being Christians. In 2012 he believed we were all going to die and since then even though he barely does it anymore he still talks about it sometimes and I'm constantly afraid of the end of the world happening. He shows me documentaries and videos about signs that the end times are here and I never planned for a future as a kid because I never thought I'd make it this far. But now that I have, I'm starting to see all new signs of the book of revelation, and even though I personally have drifted myself away from Christianity over time, I've been feeling fearful again like back then.

With the world events, I keep seeing new stuff about country tensions rising and now Israel and Palestine are at war on top of Russia and Ukraine and I have this extreme fear of being drafted or something, or if not that, dying from something else. Seeing everyone keep bringing up the idea of ww3 has given me debilitating anxiety to the point of contemplating suicide briefly to escape. I constantly go on discord hoping any friends can join and keep me company because on top of the fear of everything around me, it's caused my grades to falter so last semester I had to call friends to keep my grades in check. 

I've been mentally so much better over winter break and now that I'm about to go back to college and I saw a scary piece of news, I'm fearful that I'm going to go back in that same place of constant fear and sadness. D&amp;D with friends, my personal writing projects, making music, as well as my new adoptive baby sister are all things that have helped me stay happy during this time but I feel like it's only a matter of time before it gets worse and something really bad is going to happen. What do i do? Any advice or words of wisdom? Or comfort idk I haven't gone to therapy but I really want to. I'll have to try to get some kind of counseling at my college to get diagnosed and maybe that can help me out."

The second semester of 2023 sent me for a loop and messed me up big time. It started in July, when I got fired and a guy I hooked up in early 2022 tweeted that he wanted to have s*x with me (tagging me while saying this), film it and post it. Then, in September, my dad got diagnosed with Alzheimer's. In October I started the journey to get an autism assessment done (in late November I got the confirmation: autistic AF + GAD). Also in October, I got rejected, for the 4th time, by the masters program I wanted. In November, got rejected for my backup masters program.

Through all that, I kept unemployed (kinda against my wishes) and unable to get unemployment benefits because my last job was the equivalent to a 10-99 work in the US, so it kinda cancels out any attempt to get them. Plus all the job applications resulting in absolutely nothing, not even a ""thank you, but no, thank you"".

Even though my family says differently, I feel like I'm going to fail miserably forever. It feels like I'll stay single for another 10 years and will have to keep shitty jobs for the rest of my life just to get by."

For example we had to put eye drops in my toddlers eyes (she got pink eye) and we literally have to hold her down to do it. And she screams and cries pretty badly. It’s the only way we can do it. 
So when she was crying real hard i had this intrusive thought. I thought about how that is how she would cry if something really bad was happening to her. I mean she was screaming like she was being hurt (she wasn’t) but ever since then when she cries I think about that and it kind of changes into stuff like maybe that’s how Gabriel Fernandez cried as his pos parents tortured him and it just gets worse from there. 

I get so so so upset to the point where I feel like I can’t deal with anything. I have a 5 month old and I’m wondering if this is some kind of PPD thing.  I’ve become so fearful of the world and for my children. And my coping skills have gone away. I’m a wreck all the time and can’t stand to hear children cry."

I was planning on taking my MCAT on jan 26 but i can't find a seat. My mental health has gotten so bad, I feel dizzy all the time, feel like I haven't slept even after a full night of sleep, and have a hard time reading/hearing. I don't know if its neuro or psych but my symptoms are so bad they are affecting my ability to take the MCAT. I have a lot of pressure from parents since im already taking one gap year. I've been gaining all the weight i worked so hard to lose the last 2 years. Sometimes I genuinly feel like I'm going to die because of these dizzy spells I have. No one understands what I'm going through; maybe its all in my head. I'm scared and whats worse is my parents are starting to doubt if I'll make it to medical school because of how much its affecting me. I overheard my mom talking to my aunt about how i'm breaking and I cant handle it anymore. My dad started to talk about back up careers yesterday. I'm  never going to quit, I didn't come this far to quit. I don't know what else to say, I'm so scared of going to a doctor and them telling me its all in my head. It's not. I once had a dizzy spell so bad I stopped hearing for minutes. I have blackouts for minutes. Sometimes i feel so overstimulated have to reread things 5 times to understand what I just read. At night I feel like I could run hours. My mind runs a million miles per hour sometimes I have to talk to myself to help my mind not feel scrambled. I've always been talented, always performed well in school, been so aware and strong during every part of my life, but after all that work, when its about the matter most my body is falling apart. Is this anxiety? Is this ADHD? Do I have neuro issues? I don't even know anymore i'm too tired of wasting time thinking about this becuase what if its all just my own confirmation bias."

1963lfc,Anxiety,2024-01-14,Xanax Vs Buspar,"Hello, 

I have a history for generalized anxiety disorder with occasional panic attacks. It seems to revolve around health anxiety and I tend to worry about normal aches and pains more than I should. I also tend to become very overstimulated and overwhelmed easily. I have reached out to a testing center for ADHD testing, but that it beyond the purpose of this post. 
I have taken several SSRI/SNRI throughout the years and end up just stopping them and dealing with the mild daily anxiety symptoms I have. I have managed well for several years with just some PRN Xanax. The 15 tablet RX lasts me 6 months or longer because I just don't need to take them often. We recently got back from vacation which was very overstimulating and busy. I felt my anxiety level had creeped back up a bit and I asked my doc to try Buspar. I have taken it for 3 days now and I just have no motivation to do anything. I'm not anxious, but I'm tired and very unmotivated. I have been having hot flashes and feel a but dizzy/lightheaded for the first hour or so after taking it. I know I need to keep on it for a few weeks before the side effects subside. 
The question I have is whether or not you would rather take the occasional xanax (once or twice every few months), or be on buspar daily, hopeful it will help with the situations you know could increase your anxiety? I don't like to take medications. I'd rather just deal with my anxiety naturally, which I do, but sometimes you just need a little help I guess. 
How long have you been on buspar and have you stopped before to see if you could manage without? 

Thank you!"

1961dds,Anxiety,2024-01-13,Constant fear,"Constant fear

Hi everyone,

So I’ve been very addicted to pornography in the last 5 years of my life (I’m early 20s). My tastes escalated and I’ve been into Transexual porn and also gay porn for a few years now even though I’d consider myself straight (I’m a guy).

It is an addiction for sure. The problem is I have done a few things and I live in constant fear that my friends or someone will find out or know. I sucked a few older guys off (40s) and didn’t enjoy it and also had sex with 1. My face was on Grindr, and also on online wanking sites with strangers, I’ve sexted trans girls when horny. It’s such a mess.

My fear is that everyone knows, I am constantly paranoid. Especially because I am ashamed of this behaviour. I’m starting university soon and I live in constant fear that if I ever succeed in life and become something that people will know/find out about this and it would crush me. I constantly worry that I will make new friends, build a good life and then someone will put me/someone will have seen me online from years back and that’s it my life will be over.

I wish I never got myself in this hole. I plan on never going back to my former behaviours because the risk of exposing myself is high and also it is an addictive unwanted behaviour that negatively affects every aspect of my life. I have nothing against being gay but deep down I know that isn’t me, that’s why this is so difficult. I worry that any girl I day will find out or I’ll have to explain to them the past and what I did. 

Am I just extremely paranoid? How do I overcome this because it affects me immensely? Im basically scared to live"

1960yla,Anxiety,2024-01-13,Anyone else get anxious about if they might get diarrhea after eating something? How do I stop it?,"I (26F) have always a bit anxious around pooping, and I don’t know what it is but every few months i would get diarrhea from something i’ve eaten. i know i’ve been through it before and they only last an hour at most and i obviously survive every time and i’ve never once had any diarrhea that was so bad like i was fainting and lightheaded and needed to go to the ER or anything. Yet in the moment that I am having diarrhea, every time, *right before* i need to go to the bathroom again, i start getting an anxious/panicky/“doom” feeling in my stomach. After I’m out of the bathroom I’m anxious for a bit and then it goes away. And then i get that anxious/panicky/“doom” feeling and I go to the bathroom again. It’s not a great feeling. I also had food poisoning one time and it was in 2016. Both ends. It was horrible. 

Because of that, and because I get those anxious/panic feelings when I have diarrhea, I get this fear after eating food- especially fast food- that i’m gonna have diarrhea later. Now it doesn’t stop me from eating out, but after i’m done eating I start thinking/ruminating over whether it’s gonna happen. In general, I feel any slight bodily sensation and start thinking about it and what it could be, and so anytime I even think I heard or felt something in my stomach, I start thinking/ruminating about it and whether or not it’s gonna happen. 

Does anyone else get like this or have that “doom” feeling right before they go to the bathroom when they’re having diarrhea? Has anything helped?"

I suffer from anxiety disorder, had some depressive episodes in the past and probably have ADHD and OCD.

It happened again at a restaurant at dinner. I suddenly felt my body “leaving”, it’s such a weird feeling. 

And also, and most frequently, I think I feel that at night. I wake up during the night feeling like I can’t breathe and my heart is going to stop beating but I’m calm, it’s like I’m not there.

This isn’t to take away from others who get much worse illnesses but I haven’t been sick this long before or if I was, I was much too young to remember. 

Anyways, since I have been sick, no one except for my parents have reached out to check in on me. I have a pretty large family and lots of siblings, and they see one another often so I’m 100 percent sure that most of them know of my illness because they talk to my parents daily. However, I can’t help feel a bit lonely and hurt over not getting a single text. On the contrary, anytime certain people are sick in my family, I reach out and check in. If they go to the ER, I also send them a get well present. 

I understand that most people are just busy in their everyday lives but I can’t help feel more anxious and sad that no one has reached out from my family. Because I don’t typically get sick or have that attention on me, I have always been in a position of checking in on others in some way. Now when the role is reversed for the first time, it’s not reciprocated. 

I know this is a “me” issue and something I want advice on how I can help myself work through these feelings. Talking to my family members is not a great option because my feelings are often dismissed and it ends up resulting in more anxiety and stress. 

Any advice is appreciated."

195i2qo,Anxiety,2024-01-13,Nuance,"TW: Rape

Hey friends. This happened a little while back, but I still think about it. Well, I guess it wasn’t that far back. But it might be interesting for those of you who sometimes wonder about anxiety &amp; other mental health issues and where the line is between understanding and responsibility.

So, I dated this guy “Mark” for a couple months over the summer, pretty seriously. I have PTSD around sex, and I broke up with him because, well - we’ll just say he didn’t respond too kindly one night after a panic attack (cold, distant, “I’m not a sex therapist and I shouldn’t have to deal with this, etc.). I immediately knew I was done, we broke up, but I gotta say even now his response surprises me. He was - is? - a good person. 

Anyway, after he and I broke up I reconnected with the guy I was dating on and off before him, we’ll call this guy Donald. To keep it short: Donald ended up raping me, just minutes after I had a severe mental health crisis. 

Fast forward a few weeks. I’m at home, drinking wine and chatting with my aunt, and see I have missed calls and texts from Mark. Says he’s “just walking by” and wants to know if I’m home. Drunkenly (even though I’d asked him not to contact me again when he reached out a couple days after the rape), I tell him, I am home! Come on over!

He comes, chats, my aunt leaves, and he tells me he wants to go inside and just lie with me and hold me, and asks if this is something I’m open to. I ask if he wants it to be sexual, he says no, and I say I’m not sure - come sit and cuddle with me for a little bit and I’ll see how I feel. 

As soon as he sits with me, I immediately know it’s a no and that I’m not gonna have any man in my bed for a long time. I tell him as much and he asks why, genuinely curious and supportive, and I’m pretty vague but we keep talking and I tell him about the rape, even telling him that it was Donald and that I’d reached out to him a few weeks after he and I had broken up. Mark had always been pretty insecure about Donald. 

Y’all. Mark is present with me long enough to say he’s sorry that happened, etc., etc., and then he starts to have a panic attack. 

I sit up, hold him, support him, confused, but he won’t talk to me about what’s wrong and keeps panicking, and then reaches over and kisses me. I’m drunk enough that I’m into it, we keep kissing, and he even starts groping me. I distinctly remember him saying, “I really want to fuck you right now but I know that won’t help anything.” And then he starts panicking again. He says enough to tell me he’s never felt like this before, but refuses to talk about anything else. On top of whatever he was feeling that caused the panic attack, he seemed genuinely scared by the panic and his reaction - which I think a lot of us can relate to from our first panic attacks. I just sit with him, hold his hand, breathe with him, and tell him I’m there to listen if he wants to talk. This lasts for about 40 minutes, and then he shuts down completely. Tells me he either needs to go lie down with me - but he understands why that can’t happen for me - or he needs to leave. So he leaves. 

I don’t think anything of it, honestly, until I wake up the next morning and have this exact thought: “What the fuck? I just told him I’m suicidal and was raped and then spent 40 minutes comforting HIM??”

Here’s the thing - it’s so easy to villainize him. Should he have responded differently? Yes. Would he if he could have? Yes.

Was the kissing and groping completely inappropriate and borderline assault in its own way? Yes. Did this reveal to me some things about him that made me glad we broke up? Definitely yes. But were his feelings, his panic attack (especially as his first one), deserving of understanding and gentleness? Yes. 

In the end, we texted a little bit and I told him that I was genuinely happy to have been there to support him, AND I shouldn’t have been the one doing the caring in that instance, and I hoped that one day he could develop the emotional intelligence to manage his emotions - especially when someone else’s should be the priority. And I told him he should go to therapy. All of those things are true for me, and I don’t regret staying with and comforting him, even though I deeply needed it myself at the time. 

The right and wrong in this is grey, but, to me, kindness isn’t. The last thing I would want to do is traumatize this guy, who has already been fucked up by how our society teaches men about emotions, by showing him anything but kindness in his first moment of deep vulnerability. It’s part of the same cycle that taught Donald to separate from his emotions so much that he raped me. 

This is what I always go back to: kindness and boundaries. Not right, but kindness, and not wrong, but boundaries. With ourselves and our own emotions, and with others and theirs. I gave plenty of kindness and I regret none of it. Would I set more boundaries in the future? Probably. But, it’s nuanced. And I hope he goes to therapy. "

195yk22,Anxiety,2024-01-13,MADD diagnosis without discussion,"Hi all,

ive always been an over thinker and worrier and experienced bouts of generalized or social anxiety. In the past, I have been prescribed 20mg citalopram but found the palpitations and dry mouth really annoying and weaned myself to 10mg before coming off completely. I had tried CBT and counselling but always felt self conscious in sessions. 

I restarted 10mg citalopram when I worried my overthinking was interferring with my work progress but always suspected that there was something else undiagnosed.

i finally got the GP to listen and he referred me for ADHD testing...I was relieved to be diagnosied with inattentive ADHD...I felt the executive dysfunction and overthinking made so much sense and explained why i always felt 'out of place'. I stopped citalopram to try Elvanse (they can interact and cause seroronin syndrome) and found as the dose increased...I became very anxious 30mg was ok, 40mg..horrible with insomnia and 50mg..I felt palpitations, paranoid and was advised to try propranolol.   This was a nightmare...I felt so so low...I had not had depression but this sensation felt so physical that i was sure it was medicine related.

i stopped both the elvanse and the propranolol to take a break...and felt a return to myself- calm, creative, disorganised but neither anxious nor depressed.

i agreed to try one more stimulant for the adhd at a very low dose...methylphenidate...I tolerated a low dose without return of insomnia, palpitations or anxiety.

 Great I thought...however- ive now seen that my GP has put that i have mixed anxiety and depression disorder (MADD). This has not been discussed with me, im not on any anti-anxiety medication  and besides for ADHD- have never seen a psychiatrist. Im cross that incorrect information is on my file that could influence other doctors. I have never not worked due to stress or anxiety and have been offered nortriptyliine for migraines which i declined to take magnesium after googling the drugs side effects.

what steps should i take to get this rectified?
Am i overreacting?"

195y506,Anxiety,2024-01-13,Not sure if it’s GERD/Anxiety or Omeprazole side affect,"Hey y’all so I started taking omeprazole about 35 days ago and 2 weeks ago I saw an increase in anxiety, dizziness, lightheaded, head pressure , chest discomfort and all around weird feeling, I also feel more hungry. 

Now I have GAD, panic disorder anD PTSD as well. I just can’t tell if this is normal with GERD or is it just anxiety. Sometimes out of nowhere when laying down I’ll even get dizzy and feel like I’m floating. I hate it. Other times I feel my throat closing and my chest get real tight and feel my heartbeat very hard. Heart Palps.

I want to buy some magnesium and b vitamins to help. I went to cardiologist 3 years ago and had tons of stress Test, EchoGrams, EKGs, heart holster monitor, I even had a EKG a  month ago and X ray and monitor for 24 hours everything okay, just low magnesium a bit. I’m overweight 26 year old male 6’0 276 pounds and I have never dealt with GERD and anxiety this bad before. But this dizziness and increased anxiety and panic makes things so much more worse. I’m even afraid to eat or go out in public because of all of this 

Any advice on this? Omeprazole does not work as much tbh TUMs did more for me but I don’t want to keep taking both MAX dose of tums daily and omeprazole"

I thought it was everything starting with OCD ending with schizophrenia and well…it’s GAD.

I suspected it for years now but to hear a proffesional utter those words was like a dream come true. My emotions, my experiences and my past 3 YEARS of existence are now finally validated.

Now I at least know what I am fighting for sure.

I don’t have any tools yet but at least I know what my enemy is.

And please guys, if you have any tips on dealing with GAD (especially focused on agoraphobia issues) let me know how you dealt with it, it would mean the world.

Thank you!"

I don’t want to leave this life, and leave her. It gets so frustrating stressing over my health and diagnosis’s. It brings to a point where I just want to lie in bed all day and just cry. I’m going to try to get some therapy but that fear is still in the back of my mind. I hate it, and I am just flat out tired of it. I know it stresses her out, especially when I get really freaked out and go to the ER at 2-3am, and I don’t want that for her even if she says she doesn’t mind. I just wanna be normal again, I wanna not worry about this stuff when I have more important things to worry about.

195xta4,Anxiety,2024-01-13,Health anxiety,"I've been incredibly anxious the past month. I have anxiety about my health. Starting five years ago, I started getting random joint pains. It immediately freaked me out so I went to the doctor and had testing done. After X-rays, bloodwork, and seeing a rheumatologist, they didn't have any answers. It finally just went away and my anxiety improved, with the help of Prozac and a therapist. I've been dealing with the joint pain since then, which comes and goes and isn't debilitating or anything. The anxiety about it has been pretty low. 
This past month though, I've had another flare up and my anxiety has been awful. I know I need to go back to the doctor but I'm afraid of getting some awful diagnosis or even no answers at all again. I'm just avoiding moving forward and spiraling worst case scenarios. I have two little kids and feel like I'm not being a good mom because I'm always in my head with my anxious thoughts. And then this leads to a feeling of guilt and just more spiraling."
195xkra,Anxiety,2024-01-13,Medication recommendations for feeling calm?,"Hi, I've had anxiety since I was a kid, and have battled panic disorder for most of my 20s. I also have ADHD. I've tried Prozac and Zoloft in the past and am currently on Lexapro 10mg. I recently tried Strattera 25mg for ADHD treatment (can't do stimulants because of the impact on heart rate) for 9 days, but my doc recommended stopping because of the side effects. 

Having both anxiety and ADHD is a vicious cycle because the medications that treat ADHD make my anxiety &amp; PD worse, so I've had to forgo any ADHD treatment despite how much it impacts my life. I can't seem to find a workable solution for both.

My question is: Is there a medication you'd recommend that's not an SSRI or benzo that makes you feel really calm and at ease? I'm open even to homeopathic solutions like CBD. (I've tried magnesium and it just messed with my sleep. I also can't use marijuana anymore because, once again, like everything else, it gives me horrible panic attacks.) I'm tired of feeling on edge and wired even on an SSRI, and recently I've even been having panic attacks on flights, which has never happened to me before as a regular traveller. I can't drink coffee or alcohol, both of which I love, because they also make me anxious. At this point I just want to explore other options. I just want my resting state to be calm for once."

I began smoking weed a couple of years ago - it started out just smoking it once a week and then every day. I went travelling in May last year and Thailand was the final stop of the trip. I smoked a joint there as I had been doing every other day and woke up the next morning completely derealised - I didn’t recognise myself, everything around me looked weird and for the rest of the whole trip I was stuck in the hotel room scared to do anything. Since then, my anxiety has been awful. I have had constant dpdr 24/7, developed severe health anxiety, death anxiety and agoraphobia. When I first came back, I had really bad heart palpitations to the point where I thought I was going to have a heart attack at any point (I am 20y for reference). I went to the doctors about this had ECG’s and blood tests and all came back fine. I’ve started therapy 5-6 months ago and can see my anxiety has got slightly better but it’s still very much there. Is this just anxiety? I’m concerned it’s something else and I often get thoughts I’m going to pass out and die or just die and it starts making me feel slightly dizzy when I think about this.

EDIT: I don’t know if it’s worth mentioning that I barely ate anything whilst travelling and lost a lot of weight (I was skinny to begin with but by the end of the trip I barely had any fat on me at all) "

195wrq4,Anxiety,2024-01-13,Recent spike in anxiety symptoms,"Just joined this sub because I’m not sure what else to do. I (31m) have had mild anxiety for much of my life. I used to be proud to say that I was able to cope, and with the symptoms I used to have, I was truly able to cope. I’d get upset stomach before a first date or interview, sweaty palms before and during a long drive or busy social situation, etc. but it never was so bad that I felt out of control.

But the past month and a half or so, things have felt more and more like they’re getting out of hand. It started at the beginning of December, I was driving my girlfriend back to her house which is about an hour away. Halfway through I started feeling dizzy and faint. I had to pull off the highway and fight the sensation of passing out while she drove the rest of the way home. Since then, I’ve had several more episodes. To the point that New Year’s Day I went to the ER because I really felt like I couldn’t turn it around, heart racing and feeling like I’m going to pass out (they found nothing wrong with me and suggested it was a panic attack). And now it’s extending, yesterday I went for breakfast with my grandma, and started feeling dizzy and faint while eating. I tried to stay grounded and got through it but it was scary and embarrassing. And again today I went to breakfast with my girlfriend and almost felt like I needed to go back to the car because I felt like I was going to pass out.

It’s not constant, I do feel “normal” sometimes still, but it’s now becoming a daily occurrence where I’m in a situation or having a conversation about something with someone, and I start to feel anxious and the dizziness sets in. It’s starting to feel like it’s affecting daily life. I used to be able to go out with friends and family and enjoy myself up until the past month and a half or so. Now I’m starting to become afraid to. I try to deep breathe, I try to think about how it’ll pass, but nothing seems to help but time and removing myself from the situation I’m in. It happens every time I drive to or from my girlfriend’s house now too.

I have no real trauma that I can think of to cause this. I have reduced my caffeine intake but I do vape. Work is stressful, and I’ve had some added stress recently with my mother’s alcoholism (she wasn’t one when I was a kid). But frankly nothing new, and nothing specifically I can think of that would be causing this. Even sitting here writing this now I can feel myself tensing up and I can feel the faint-y feeling in my head.

I just don’t know what to do. Has anyone else had similar experience?"

I absolutely hate dealing with people. Like I deeply despise having to talk to others or being looked over constantly. My best job experiences were when I was told a task I had to do and I’d be left alone to do it. I thrive in solitude. Most jobs don’t allow for this however. I can’t just be by myself. Most jobs surround servitude and I struggle on doing this. 

I get an adrenaline rush out of working counter for fast food and just staring at people for a few minutes on a regular conversation has me get a spike on adrenaline and makes cringe and uncomfortable. I would describe social interaction as almost disgusting to me. I have worked many different jobs and this feeling just doesn’t seem to grow out of me. Military in fact made it worse. I’ve been considering seeking a psychiatrist for medication to relax or avoiding fast food jobs like the plague. Any advice?

In the military people would be complaining and falling into depression due to being lonely and to me it was the contrary. I absolutely adored being by myself and it was the height of the military getting a check and actually being left alone to do a job. It was the absolute contrary for me. My day would be amazing up until that minute I had to deal with someone. That’s why I got separated from the military because in my second command people would not leave me alone or leave me be. They would constantly be looking for me or bothering me about some stupid sht and more so than I ever had been bothered in my life. I could not work in that environment so I got out"
195vwl2,Anxiety,2024-01-13,Fear of developing Schizophrenia?,"I’ve had an extremely bizarre few days and it’s left me feeling drained and exhausted

This technically started a few weeks ago: I was in my living room and the door to the dining room was open. In the corner of my eye I thought I saw a shape/someone in the hallways, but it was just a combination of light trickery and a chair. Normally i’d think nothing of this, but then I had a thought…”what if this is schizophrenia?”. I should have found the idea of this silly, but for some reason it really freaked me out and gave me a fairly intense anxiety attack. It was so bad that I felt kind of rough for the next few days afterwards, but eventually I was able to forget about it and move on

&amp;#x200B;

Flash forward to 2 days ago. I went to bed like normal, but out of nowhere i had a bunch of uncontrollable toughts in my head, just like random noises/gibberish one after the other. It didn’t last all that long, and i fell asleep soon after. In the morning i again didn't think much of it, but by the evening my thoughts again turned to the possibility of me having a schizophrenic episode without me even knowing. This lead to me having an awful sleep with me trying to think relaxing/peaceful thoughts but having them get interrupted with a random noise or gibberish (again, in my head)

I started to hyperventilate, my voice started to break and I physically felt like was going to choke. My throat tightened up and I couldn't continue on speaking, it was painful! It was a really scary experience. My sister started to panic as well and asked me to seek therapy as she can tell I'm holding a lot in. I haven't a clue why I reacted like that to simply sharing my feelings. Is this typical of a dismissive avoidant or is it anxiety?

I yelled at my elderly mother in the grocery store today and I feel like the shittiest person. I realize especially after my dad passed that I have so much anger issues with the way i was raised by my parents and they are unresolved. My mom's OCD is so traumatic and triggering to me that it makes me angry and I would immediately feel guilty afterwards.

Today I took her grocery shopping and her OCD was again triggered me. I wanted her to enjoy being out but when she insisted on how items must be laid out on the conveyor belt and contorted her face  at how the cashier laid her items in the cart, I just got angrier. At that point all I wanted to do was leave the place but she insisted on moving the cart for the cashier. I think at that point I just lost it. I must have raised my voice and said MOM ITS FINE JUST LEAVE it.

When I got back to the car I realized o hurt her feelings and embarrassed both of us. I really didn't mean to and I apologized. But I feel like the shittiest person still and I'm also worried that people at the grocery store think I'm a monster for yelling at an elderly. I even worry that someone will call elderly protection.

My last good sleep was after my ex i went on mirtazapine for a couple of months, but I didn’t like how I didn’t feel like myself. Though maybe it’s time to try again because I really need a break from feeling like this.

I’m reading the power of now and watching lots of self help YouTube on letting go of caring too much, but I still overthink everything.

Even at work I feel as if my eyes are glazed over and I’m seeing a cross faded image of the present moment and past or future things I’m stressing about. Like seriously bad brain fog. Lack of sleep makes it worse.

I recently had a bad experience with a guy but I was too scared to speak up for myself. He’s meant to be my friend but I’m so scared of ppl being mad at me or hurting me that I let him do something I didn’t really want. 

I can let it go and I don’t mind, it is what it is, though I’m still very annoyed and will speak to him soon. I still can’t stop obsessing over this situation.

But it doesn’t matter what the situation is tbh I feel I’m always consumed by anxiety.

I’m not sure if it’s me or that I keep getting myself into bad situations that cause the anxiety.

195tlt7,Anxiety,2024-01-13,Some Sort Of Chest Spasms...?,"(This is my first time making a Reddit post, so I hope I'm doing this right, lol.)

A bit of background on my physical health, as well as my struggle with anxiety: I'm 16F, and my diagnosed conditions are PCOS and GERD. I'm struggling to get my PCOS under control with birth control, and my GI doctor has not yet identified what is causing my GERD. I have an endoscopy in two weeks. I've always had anxiety to a certain extent, but since my hormones have gone crazy, it's been so much worse. I've had about 9 or 10 full-blown panic attacks to date- two of which landed me in the ER. Because of these health struggles, I‘ve developed health anxiety. Lately, the majority of my health anxiety has centered around my heart. I have had an EKG and blood work, and got normal results for both of them. I'm still struggling to find reassurance in that, though.

For a few weeks now, I've had this feeling in my chest that I would describe as a ""spasm."" It feels like something is tightening or moving. Thankfully, it only lasts a few seconds at most, and it is never painful at all- just noticeable. It happens several times a day- if I was guessing, about 5-10 times a day, Of course, like anyone with health anxiety, I have spent an inordinate amount of time on Google, but I can't find much info on this symptom at all. I'm inclined to think it might have something to do with GERD, since it can cause a variety of different chest sensations, or that it is just anxiety. But, as a lot of my anxiety is about my heart, every time I feel any kind of chest sensation, I think my heart is getting ready to crap out.

Of course, I'm not seeking medical advice on Reddit, but I am curious to know if any of my fellow anxiety sufferers have experienced this symptom, or anything like it. Might repost to this to the GERD group as well. I think that just knowing I'm not alone in experiencing this symptom would help me quite a bit! :)"

I played sports my whole life. I played football in highschool and the times of intense physical activity were always the times I had the least anxiety. I got into weightlifting and continued through into college. I never did any cardio as I kind of hated it in highschool (I associated it with running endless sprints in football). I mostly just did bodybuilding type workouts to look good and I think it relieved some stress but not much. The last two years I have had the worst anxiety of my life. And I think it may be directly coo related to my sedentary lifestyle. I walk around a lot and even go for hikes pretty often and I’m in good shape. I’m starting to think I need to really get my heart rate up. It feels like in the last couple years the only times my heart rate has been super high is during episodes of anxiety/panic.

Now I’m concerned about the side effect it could bring me. Is it common for a man to get the surgery? Would that affect my sex life? Each time I could not get hard with my gf, I can’t help thinking that could it be the surgery or it’s just my anxiety. Sometimes I’m able to get hard and have sex and sometimes I failed. I checked my body with a Urologist and he told me I’m physically fine. But could the surgery hurt my nerves which made me fail to get hard? I’ll appreciate any help"
195ss9j,Anxiety,2024-01-13,Mom had short-term memory loss after an argument,"Hi Anxiety folks,

I'm frankly not even sure if this is the right place to post this. The first thing let me say: I will make sure she is checked out by her doctor and or a neurologist. We have good access to good doctors where we live, so I am grateful for that.

Now to what's happened.

For the last two to three weeks my mother (60 years old, some preexisting conditions, but no recently new medicaitions
) has been under high stress from family related nonsense. Nothing serious, but she takes things very personally and seriously, and it has caused her to really become emotional and upset, etc. Nothing out of character there. 

Yesterday morning, around 7am, she had a ""blow-up"" argument regarding some of this stuff for about 30 minutes. At around 10am, when asked about this fight, she had no recollection of this moment at all. She had no idea what anyone was talking about regarding this fight, or any of the 'drama'/nonsense around it. Shortly thereafter, after some prodding, she was able to recollect. 

So, forgot - which no, its not something you'd forget, especially in that time - then remembered shortly thereafter. As far as I know, this was the first instance of something like this. But, who can be sure?

I've heard stress and trauma can cause people to black out certain memories. But I haven't heard (not that I've heard much) of people then later regaining that memory. I truly have no clue. I'm obviously spiraling myself and starting to worry about things like dementia, strokes, etc. But wondering if anyone has heard or dealt with something like this, because anxiety and stress is where my thoughts first went on this.

Would deeply appreciate any thoughts."

195s05d,Anxiety,2024-01-13,I always worry about the wrong things.,"This might sound weird but I haven‘t found anything online about this.
Everytime something stressful happens in my life my mind starts to worry about something completely else. For example I have an upcoming test which is stressful but all I can think about is that I don‘t have a girlfriend and how I will never find someone. These thoughts intensify as the test comes closer.
This makes it pretty hard to focus on the test because I start to believe that finding a girlfriend should be my priority.
Does anyone else have this same problem?"
195rzjp,Anxiety,2024-01-13,Anxiety and preemptive homesickness?,"Hi, everyone. I’m 21F, a college junior. I go back in two days.

So here’s the deal. I’ve been having these really powerful feelings of anxiety since my twin brother went back to his college on Thursday. 

The thing that is really making me anxious (I know this sounds stupid) is that I won’t be able to see and hug my parents every day. That’s the thing I miss most when I’m away at college,  and whenever I come back home I’m struck by how much I’ve needed it. The idea of not being with them makes me feel incredibly anxious and lonely, even though I’m still at home with them. I just don’t get it. I love college. My parents love me. My boyfriend is here. So why do I have this massive knot in my stomach? Why do I feel like crying all the time? Why am I suddenly so afraid to go back to school when I’m already 5 semesters in?

We’re going into the city today and my mom has told me that I need to get the anxiety under control when we do. Does anybody have any tips? How have they dealt with these feelings?"

I went to behavioral therapy for about 6 months because of that, and I'm happy to say that I haven't experienced everyday anxiety and depersonalization ever since I finished therapy about 1 1/2 years ago (I wasn't taking meds back then and never have taken them before).

My problem now is that, seemingly out of nowhere, I am experiencing heightend anxiety and depersonalization again and it really scares me. And since behavioral therapy is very inaccessible and expensive where I live, I was wondering if any of you have any positive experiences with medication for depersonalization? Don't get me wrong, I'm very well aware that depersonalization has a reason or trigger, and the best solution to get rid of it sustainably is going to behavioral therapy - I was just wondering if maybe medication can be just as helpful for this? Since meds are a bit more accessible and affordable, and I'd like to use them to bridge over until I'm able to find an available behavioral therapist."

195rpzk,Anxiety,2024-01-13,What medication to try next?,"Hi all - I’m wondering which medication to try for my anxiety/depression.

A bit of history - when I was younger and first diagnosed, I tried a number of different SSRIs. None of them felt like they had any impact, but when i eventually stopped taking anything, I was left with a very empty feeling which I’ve never really been able to shake. As a result, rightly or wrongly, I feel that the SSRIs have done some long term damage to me (emotional blunting and sexual dysfunction after stopping them) and for a long time I decided not to touch them or any other anti-depressant medication again.

A year ago, after a significant number of years had passed, I decided to go and speak to a private psychiatrist, to see if i could treat some of the underlying anxiety/depression i still felt was lingering, as well as seeing if of emotional blunting/sexual dysfunction could be treated. 

In addition to some therapy, the medications I have tried in the last year are:

1. Buspirone for about 6 months. Made me dizzy and possibly heightened anxious thoughts 

2. Switched to Moclobemide, which I am still taking. No negative side effects but very little to note in terms of positives. Possibly improved things very slightly, say by 5%

I am considering trying something new. My psychiatrist is pretty open to a trial and error approach and within reason willing to prescribe whatever I am comfortable trying. I am UK based so some things such as Parnate are not possible.

Does anyone have any suggestions for things that have worked really well for their anxiety/depression that are not SSRIs or the 2 mentioned above?"

195qdym,Anxiety,2024-01-13,feeling anxious all the time because of parents (long post),"im a student (19F) and my really bad anxiety affected a lot on my studies. i was the topper in my grade out of 400 students when i was until 10th grade. i rarely had mental breakdowns and those were for little reasons and would normally be over within a day or two. but suddenly when 2020 pandemic happened we were all in our homes with families and during this period of time i found stuff that i shouldn't have seen and it made my mental health worse. so at that time i didn't have a phone (i was 16) and used my mom's phone for school work. that's when i found out her texting to a man and they texted literally everyday. i didn't read her conversations but when sometimes i used the phone, i have seen the notifications of the chat. it wasn't bad but i just got so scared thinking what if my dad founds about any of this and will it break my family apart? i was so scared. i gradually got anxious whenever i saw my mom talking in a very low voice to someone on the phone and i don't know how to explain but this slowly made my mental health worse day by day without me even realizing it. 

so days passed and i cried a lot sometimes feeling helpless. so after in person classes began and tests were given, i realized how behind i was in my studies and my marks weren't bad but i became 10th in my class. i know it's not bad but being such bright student before, everyone was shocked why i scored lower but i didn't tell anyone anything. days passed i did my o levels went to do a levels. so my dad caught mom's texting thing and became so mad and they used to fight a lot and this made my mental health much more worse. these incidents happened in 2022 and last year which were so important years for me in my academics. im currently having a levels and i know if i fully focused on my work without having to worry about anything, i can enter med school in my first attempt. so this parental conflicts affected me a lot in my studies and there were days (sp. 2022) where i locked myself in my room and cried and then slept because i can't focus on literally anything. 

so to distract myself i started watching films and vids on yt and im addicted to social media now. dad being always angry and mom cheating on him i just don't know what will happen in future. i always thought of getting selected to a uni far away from home so that i can move out from this toxic household. i don't hate them cuz i know they put food on the table and spend for my education. im grateful for that. the panic attacks i have had during last two years were so bad and i wished i had someone special in my life to share my life with. i have never told this to anyone, not even my closest friends. i just want to get out of this toxicity and live my life happily.thank u for reading and if possible leave any advice for me. much love xx"

I also had an energy drink with 200mg caffeine this morning which.. again.. obviously terrible for anxiety. I also went to bed late so I'm running on low sleep. 3 things that are completely in my control that I fucked and am now paying the price. 

Those of us who have anxiety disorders have to operate under a different set of guidelines, it is what it is. We are just more sensitive to this kinda shit and I can't believe I would self destruct like that and pay the price by having this panic attack. Sucks. I'll try to be smarter in the future.

I've taken my prescription medication for anxiety to help deal with it but it's still happening and it's really bothering me for some reason. 

I don't have feelings for this friend, and even if I did nothing could ever come of it cause he's straight. And it's not like I feel heartbroken or anything, it's just pure anxiety. As if he told me he had gotten injured and is in the hospital not as if he had gotten laid.

Of course, the terrible spiral of a rabbit hole of symptoms that can be associated with a ton of things.

I know I have health anxiety and I know when it’s happening but sometimes it’s hard to tell which is happening first. My body temp is usually in the mid to upper 97°s, the other night it was 96.7 and this morning it was 98.3. That seems like a big shift, granted it’s winter and the heater is on to 72-73°F. Yet, my eyes feel dry and that dry ‘burn’ when I close them, hot flashes come when I get anxious yet me temp is 98.1-3. I know that’s normal but I’m obsessing about taking my temp. I don’t have any other symptoms, just the fast heart rate, hot sensation, dry mouth and eyes despite good water intake, clear urine, etc. just anxiety and overthinking? What symptoms do others go through? 

Ive averaged 4-6hours of sleep the past 4 nights too, can circadian rhythm be off and affect body temp?"

I'm currently taking escitalopram (lexapro) but is an on and off, I'm taking it again since 3 days ago because anxiety is piking like crazy again. My anxiety is in the form of adrenaline/cortisol rushes that are worst at night, creating me pains, insomnia and terror. The thing is I have this terrible anxiety always related to the jobs and work. For some reason, even at my age, I have hard time having to go outside my comfort zone. Everytime I have to do it and more with job related, I have the worst panic attacks and the worst anxiety to the point I freeze. And I hate this because in reality I like to work and I always dream to have a job I like, but for some reason I always end in jobs I don't like or I don't feel secure with them. Is like everything related to job hunt, to go to work etc is panic attack inducing me... To be honest I don't know what else to do. I was fired from the last job 4 months ago and now I'm without money and without perspectives. I try to calm down but I always think to be expelled from the house (I live on rental) and to be without nothing. I want to try to settle down with the escitalopram to work for the worst syntoms and then to go to find a job again, because like this my anxiety is so bad I stop eating, drinking, bathing... 

I'm lucky I have a family that supports me and friends and a boyfriend that love me, but I feel like a failure for them and for myself. I wish I could go to therapy but until I don't have a job is going to be impossible...

The anxiety grew with time and flared up after exercising. I also developed stomach issues gradually during this period. 
I discovered I was b12 deficient after blood work and started supplementing with treatment for H. Pylori infection diagnosed by endoscopy.
It has been above 4 months and I am still experiencing anxiety, increased awareness of heartbeat while resting, muscle fatigue, head pain, neck pain, weakness and stomach issues. But all the symptoms have been improving, week over week and more noticibly month over month. The way I am feeling now, is the most normal I've felt in the past 4 months.

I did not continue antidepressants over fear of dependency and eventual tapering, as I was getting better with time anyway. My anxiety is not so extreme as it started and may be considered mild now. I can do daily routine stuff but just fear if anxiety might have an impact on my body. I can feel my heartbeat in my neck while climbing stairs. I wanted to know if it is normal occurance for anxiety to develop high blood pressure or insulin resistance.

I get heart palpitations just from the rush of everything race through my head and can’t ever put it into words what I’m feeling. I feel like I can’t ever just relax and it’s causing me to be not the best version of myself and affect others around me. I don’t know where to begin or what to even do because anytime I tell a doctor they brush it off as me being a hypochondriac. They put me on blood pressure pills because it was always high when that alone caused me to be more anxious about my health and I feel like it’s caused a never ending loop of paranoia.

195ngq6,Anxiety,2024-01-13,Sleepless Anxiety Spiral,"Hey all. Two nights ago, I randomly couldn’t sleep. I sometimes get these intrusive thoughts like, “it would suck if you didn’t sleep tonight” and then sure enough, that’s what happens. I slept for about 2 hours and pushed through the day - felt groggy and weird but it’s happened before so I felt okay with it. However, when it was time to go to bed, I immediately started thinking “what if you don’t sleep again??” And sure enough, that’s what happened. Every time I was about to pass into dream land, I felt this surge of anxiety through my chest. My heart palpitates and I’m immediately awake. I slept about 2 hours again and felt way more groggy and out of it but, again, pushed through. Last night, the same thoughts ran through my head and, once again, I barely slept. Now I’m on day 3 of minimal sleep and it’s absolutely freaking me out. 

I’ve pushed through the “panic” feeling when falling asleep many times before - I don’t know what’s so different about this time. I was sleeping completely fine up until the other day - like falling asleep in a couple of minutes, mostly sleeping through the night, etc. 

I went to urgent care yesterday to see if they could give me something for the anxious feelings but they couldn’t prescribe anything like that, nor could they prescribe sleep aids. The annoying part is that I’m *exhausted*. I’ve tried talking myself through the panic spells, tried a small dose of sleep aid (ZzQuil) and nothing seems to be helping. I’m at the point where I’m panicking and debating going to a hospital or mental health clinic.

Normally. And so I got bad anxiety, started hating on myself. Now I am in 11th grade, learned to love myself properly, taking care of myself. But there are some annoying people in my class, they do far from bullying, they just make comments and they are annoying and they are big pussies so they can't really say anything to my face but try to whisper shit to me when they walk past or just say shit. They can't even look me in the eyes, they are super insecure. I tell that to myself, that I am better than them and I am no longer the sad insecure kid and they just don't know their worth and try to boost their crumbling ego by being annoying like that. But I hate that my mind remembers the times where I was actually bullied and activates my flight or fight response and I just get bad anxiety. Like my chest is tight, my heart beats fast, I struggle to focus or breathe, I want to cry. And its over nothing because they legit sound like npcs repeating the same shit everyday for like 2 years, talk about being obsessed and insecure. But I still hate it, I don't feel threatened because I know my worth and I know I am way better than they will ever be/I am a better person but still my body reacts. And on top of the fact that I get anxiety from my Ocd and then I get the anxiety from the fact that I remember the shit that happened before and it just piled up and crumbles me down. I don't want to ruin my health because of some stupid people that honestly deserve a good kick in the ass. 
This isn't edited I just wanted to get it out of me becauseI don't want to give anyone the satisfaction that they are somehow getting to me.

I have a raging nicotine addiction (been smoking since I was 14) which of course is hidden from my family. I also was addicted to weed but due to money constraints and the anxiety it gave me, I stopped. Then, I was addicted to topical steriods for my eczema which caused me to have TSW. I have had tendencies wherein I took double the dosage of something to get a better hit from it (topical steriods, weed, and the like). Like one time I was very frustrated of not being able to sleep properly due to my anxiety making me take 5 melatonin pills because 1 didn‘t work — which all my friends were very upset I did. I‘m scared that I have addiction and dependency tendencies. I‘m afraid to get prescribed Xanax or any drug to help with my anxiety because what if I become addicted. What should I tell my psychiatrist? More so what should I tell my parents? If I even have the guts to admit it to them."

195jj2m,Anxiety,2024-01-13,Success Story - Vitamins,"I’ve (28f) struggled with anxiety for a long time. Everything from minor fears to crippling, full-blown panic attacks. My anxiety would come in waves. Sometimes I was okay for weeks, sometimes I could barely get through the day. It’s been a long journey. 

I’ve been in therapy on and off since I was a kid. I didn’t have a perfect childhood and my mom always made sure we talked to someone about it. Even though I was in therapy at a young age I would lie to therapists and try to pretend everything was okay. This bottling up snowballed into my adult life. 

As an adult I was diagnosed with anxiety and was both medicated (age 21) and in therapy. I still struggled. I’ve been on Zoloft, Lexapro, Xanax, Atarax, etc. - never really liked any of them. I felt spacey and numb, not healed. Therapy has always helped but moving states several times and now to a foreign country has made it difficult to keep up with a therapist regularly. It’s also expensive. 

Last year I was struggling really bad. My family experienced two major deaths in a 5 months, flew home unexpectedly for several weeks to be with family, had to be away from my partner, developed a ton of new irrational fears and was just overall struggling. Spent a lot of time on the couch and drinking. At one point I had minor chest pains and convinced myself I was having a heart attack - one embarrassing emergency room visit later and I was just so bummed with myself. 

Out of the blue I saw a TikTok about Magnesium, D3, and Ashwaganda. Thought hey, nothing can really hurt at this point, and gave it a go. 

My life has changed. I feel 85% less anxious than I did before, and the other 15% is manageable. My mood is much more stable and predictable. I can shut down anxious thoughts before I get carried away. I’m happier. I’m more carefree. It’s been 7 months and while I’m still nervous that another wave might strike, I do feel like I’m more balanced and equipped to handle it. 

I’m by no means a doctor and I know there isn’t a cure all. I’ve struggled for years and have tried lots of different methods. I still want to get back into therapy. But I just feel that this is useful information. My mom is still on anxiety meds but also taking the same vitamin cocktail now, I’m excited to see how she goes. I’m excited to see how I go."

195jetd,Anxiety,2024-01-13,Hello.,"First time poster. All the time an anxious person. I'm a 32 year old man and I, unfortunately, struggle with normal day adult things. Like getting a job. I haven't had a job for god knows how long. I was a caregiver for my grandmother during COVID-19 times which I won't lie was a nightmare and I wouldn't do it for a complete stranger but at the same time it was a job that didn't require me to leave the house all the time cause well COVID. She sadly died a few years ago. I'm not trying to downplay that as ""Oh no my grandma died so no more job."" I miss my grandma. We all do. Before that, I tried working at UPS as a package handler cause I've been helping my aunt with her online stores by packaging all her items. I thought maybe all the years helping my aunt box her items would help. It didn't. Different kind of job lol. I sadly couldn't take the hard work and didn't go back the second day. I felt really bad about that and I wish I could fix it.   


I guess I wanna know is how are people with severe anxiety able to work? I sadly don't have any skills that can help me. I unfortunately never finished school and I don't have any friends. I wish I did have a friend irl cause I feel like that would make me feel more comfortable lol. Idk if I can handle retail but it looks like my only option. Making a mistake in front of or talking with people is hard on me. Mostly cause I don't wanna be a failure in front of strangers. Things are becoming really hard this year sadly and I need to think of something. I've only made about $70 this month and that's not enough. Most people just tell me to suck it up and get a job. Are they right?"

195iddd,Anxiety,2024-01-13,My life’s a mess and it’s my fault,"Im 17, an autistic guy, and generally hate where I’m at in life, and it’s been like this for a while, I used to have close friends, but I moved around, drifted apart, (idk if trauma caused anything but had some traumatic events), and like, the past 3 years of my life nobody’s been really close to me who I can trust, I have friends who occasionally mutually traumadump on each other but I don’t necessarily feel safe and confident with them.

It’s been a solid 4 years since then, and even then, what close friends I had at the time were a lie, I was on a bunch of meds and turns out I wasn’t as liked by them as I thought I was.

Even now, I’ve grown, I’ve learned to interact better for good and bad, I have what’s considered a normal social life, I get invited to parties, people check in on me, I’m very on teams in my schools STEM programand yet often get home and just am consumed with thoughts and loneliness

I’m getting to a point now where I basically only socialize in group settings and parties cause I am way too scared of talking to people with intention or doing smth with just one friend, even though friends invite me to do stuff and clearly like me or smth

Many nights Ill sit at my desk after practice, try and do something, fail to be productive cause ADHD and no attention span, get on discord, find myself feeling lonelier, then get shitfaced and SH for a few hours, fall asleep with my knife, wake up with it digging into my back, and carry on like nothing happened.

Nothing seems to work right for me, I know I can make friends and stuff, I’m just way too scared to do anything, resulting in pushing people away and wallow in sorrow in bed. Which sucks.

I hate this cause in most respects I live a better life than allot of people like me, talks to friends multiple times a week, has had a girlfriend, has been accepted to collage and on track to graduate in less than a year, yet still am horribly unhappy

Yeah sorry this has no point, I just have been in my head tonight and don’t think I should be alone right now so like, any tipsor support would be nice (I understand that I’m not finding much though)"

He’s gorgeous, 6’2, has long dark hair &amp; really pulls it off for a guy, strong jawline but soft cute features, and I like his trendy old school style. He’s a bit of a bad boy, which I like. We’ve got talking about porn &amp; sex, we shared which porn vids we like with each other through messenger. But we haven’t necessarily flirted. 

I want to open up to him &amp; say I find him incredibly attractive, but since we haven’t met in person I don’t wanna scare him off. I want to tell him my feelings for him before we meet in person, but at the same time I don’t want him pulling away. My anxiety has been higher thinking about what the outcomes could be. It would be super obvious I’ve got a crush on him if we met in person, so that’s why I want to tell him before. Plus, my anxiety around someone when I’ve got a crush on them is INSANE, so I don’t wanna tell him I fancy him in person while I can’t even look at him in the eye due to my anxiety. 

I’ve had thoughts of sending him photos (not nudes) of myself &amp; seeing his reaction to them, I go out a lot so I can say something like “here’s some snaps of me from the past few weeks, it was fun!” Or something casual like that not to make it awkward or random.

I despise work that involves dealing with people. Like... deeply. I get a rush more from dealing with people than I ever did dealing with F-18's on the flight deck in the Navy (I worked flight deck).

I talk through the speaker at the fast food taking orders and I think it's the combination of the speaker being low quality and the rush that makes me zone out or not understand what the hell clients are saying. Clients are rude as hell as well sometimes for no reason. I also have dry eye syndrome and the weather in texas is cold so every time I open the window my eyes feel like garbage and they start watering. That summed up with my anxiety and my self awareness of how my eyes look I'm getting fully pumped adrenaline for hours and my eyes look like they're next to crying and my nose is running due to the excess tear production from my eyes going down my nose. It's embarassing but I just can't seem to help myself.

Almost all anxiety issues revolve around things people can't control.

My debilitating medical health issues, BOOM this graph solved it!

My Severe weather anxiety BOOM solved it!

Therapists (both psychiatrists and psychologists) provide affirmations and profit from their services. My psychiatrist asserted that I possess high intellect, leading to dependence due to our inclination for positive reinforcement. Repeated interactions result in financial gains for therapists.

195f0vk,Anxiety,2024-01-13,Searching for some sanity.,"Hello! I’m so sorry this is really long but I’ve been struggling recently and wanted to see if anyone feels similar things to me. I appreciate anyone reading this.  I was diagnosed at a young age with GAD. I didn’t understand really what I was feeling as a kid and couldn’t really communicate what I was feeling, so I was put on Zoloft at 9 years old. My anxiety was more so just butterflies in my stomach and a racing heart. 10 years later I decided to wean myself off (probs not the best idea but I moved away and wasn’t near my psychiatrist) and I started smoking weed which really helped at first. A few years after that it started having the opposite affect and made my anxiety worse so I made the decision to quit smoking. Withdrawal was really hard at first and I had a lot of anxiety but I started to get better. Then out of nowhere a few months ago after being sick back to back with strep and pneumonia my anxiety took a turn for the worse. I started getting a tight chest, static/fuzzy feeling in my brain (not really dizzy but not focused either) nausea, weak arms and legs. My symptoms turned way more physical. I don’t have a GP but I’m gonna try a few out, get some rest done for peace of mind, and I’m really hesitant to start medication. I take CBD right now which usually helps my baseline anxiety but when I have a panic attack it’s detrimental. I have to take Benedryl to relax my chest and make the weird feelings in my body and brain go away. The last couple days  my chest, stomach, and throat get so tight my breathing becomes shallow, and I start to freak out and feel light headed. Once again I take half a Benedryl to chill out. (I try not to take Benedryl everyday just when it’s bad and recently it’s been bad). There’s just so much stigma around taking medications nowadays and I don’t really trust pharmaceutical companies so I’m nervous to go on anything. Ive had hydroxyzine and that helped for panic attacks but I don’t want to take that everyday. Breathing exercises tend to make me feel light headed and more anxious. And right now exercising makes my chest tight and I feel weak! I’ve cut caffeine, weed, and alcohol completely. And I’m about to quit vaping as well, and readjust my diet so my blood sugar never drops (makes me super shaky weak and anxious I had a bad anxiety attack today because I didn’t eat enough). But does anyone else get really tight chest/throat to the point when you’re relaxing your muscles just hurt afterwards? Or does anyone else get weird feelings in their brain almost like derealization and fuzziness? I’m gonna look for a therapist as well but it’s just been really hard lately, and my brain likes to convince me in those episodes that I’m gonna pass out and no one will find me, or that I’m basically dying. I’ve never had anxiety like this my whole life until now I’m in my early 20’s! I’m hoping to get a new job soon and I don’t want my anxiety to make me homebound. I can’t really do anything anymore because I always fear the worst. Does/Did anyone else feel anything similar? And what do/did you do?"

Long story short: when I was five an older boy (seven) took my to a secluded part of the playground, made me kiss him, groped me, pushed against a wall and tried to take my clothes off, that’s all I remember right now. 
These memories have been not on my mind for the past nine years but recently at dinner with my family he got brought up. All the memories flooded back and I’m still trying to remember everything. 

As far as I know my mom has no idea what happened. Recently I’ve been falling into a sort of a depression. I’ve been really stressed due to not knowing what actually happened to me. I don’t know how far anything went, like if it was just touching or if it was something more. 

I feel it’s something I kind of have to tell her but I’m really scared to. I was planning on doing tonight, I wrote out what I wanted to say and I was going to send it to her through text but today when she got home she kept asking me what was wrong. I keep nervous laughing and telling her nothings wrong but she clearly doesn’t believe. Just now while watching tv there was a scene where a girl was talking about being sa’d and she looked at me weird like she knew something was up, she’s never done that before and I can’t tell if I’m just being paranoid about it. I feel like I can’t tell her now, I was already worried she wouldn’t believe me, maybe think it was just an excuse for why I’ve been sleeping more than usual or since it was so long ago and I can’t remember it that well maybe she would think I’m making it up. What if she thinks I’m just copying the girl off tv. 

I don’t know how she’s going to react and it’s driving me crazy because I don’t know what to do. Should I tell her? Should I wait? Should I just not tell her at all? I’m so confused and I need advice please."
195eivv,Anxiety,2024-01-13,Life is hard,"Like the title states life is really hard. I know people are going through things 1000x worse than me. I don’t want to sit here and complain, I love my life. I’ve gone through really traumatic things but I know there’s a good reason it happened. However, I won’t lie I do get sad thinking about it tbh and it’s hard to deal with at times. I noticed how different I am in terms of how my brain works now. I’m extremely insecure and became a really disorganized adult. I’m extremely weak/sensitive. I hate that about myself, I can also be really negative, I have the worst anxiety/social anxiety although I try really hard not to be this way. It might be due to my traumas (something really troubling happened to me Including SA, car accident, family deaths that sort of thing) They replay in my mind often and I suffer a huge amount of guilt, then I think about the traits I really hate about myself, I view myself as the most ugly human being from the inside and out. Again I do love my life, I’m happy for everything I just can’t get over these things and it’s distorting the way I look at myself. I get anxiety talking to people and I don’t socialize, i get the feeling no one really wants anything to do w/ me. Even my own sister avoids me and I truly believe it has to do with the type of person I am. I feel like l carry bad luck and vibes that people can easily sense. I’m not the best person but I’m genuinely striving for it. I hate having this dark/troubling side of me. - Thank you to whoever took the time to read this, I know it’s long."
195eiu4,Anxiety,2024-01-13,Work Mistakes,"I'm five weeks into a new job, I work in a clothes store it was originally a Christmas temp job however, 3 shifts before what was meant to be my last shift, they gave me a permanent job. Yesterday at work, I was sent to look after the front of the store and when you work at the front of the store you're also responsible for the people walking in and if an alarm goes off, you need to check it out. You can't leave that position unless you're instructed to do so by a manager. 

There was this kid I'd say about 2/3 running in and out the shop making the alarm go off because they was wearing a hat that they'd obviously picked up off the side somewhere. Her parents were nowhere to be seen. I couldn't leave my place so I was watching this kid and making sure that they were okay and they weren't running far out of the shop just outside the door. 

Their mom eventually came from where ever she'd been and got her kid and put the hat back and it was fine. The managers didn't seem to notice so nothing was said to me but I just feel bad. The thing is though I didn't know what to do, I couldn't leave my place the kid like I said was fine I was watching them from a far and I don't like getting involved with stuff like this, I just wish parents would watch their children.

This women was looking at me like ""well aren't you going to do something"" I couldn't call for anyone because nobody else was around who I could shout over to. I could've radioed them but sometimes nobody answers or they're busy doing something else and I also didn't want to disrupt people. 

I did what I thought was best and made sure the kid was fine I was watching them but I don't like going up to small kids and asking them to come back in or to give me the stuff. I'd rather a parent do that because I don't want to seem rude. It didn't get brought up and everything was fine but I'm just worried about it."

195czlh,Anxiety,2024-01-13,What do I do if helping a loved one through a panic attack also triggers one in me?,"So, family’s been going through shit recently. No need to elaborate. Anyway, a loved one of mine has recently been in a very low state mentally and basically alternates between depression and panic attacks. The panics are near constant, multiple times a day. I want to help really badly, but my own anxiety prevents things from going smoothly. 

Most of the time I just crack and start asking a bunch of questions, like if she’s okay, needs any help, space or whatnot, and how bad her panicking is. I know, I know, rapid fire questions aren’t the best way to solve an attack, but it’s almost a compulsion- like I need to understand what’s happening before i can help, otherwise if I don’t feel out the situation beforehand it’ll feel like i’m always doing the wrong thing when I actually try helping her, which sends me into a panic, and well yeah. Double the problem.

Help? I’ve had severe anxiety before in the past so you’d think I’d know how to get through this smoothly, but my own anxieties get in the way, and if I don’t give into my unhealthy compulsions then my own issues will rear their ugly head.

Thanks"

Today at work, I got palps that sounded like 

bumBUM bum..bum (then back to my normal rhythm). I don’t know if it was the milk I drank or what. I WAS NOT FEELING ANXIOUS OR EVEN THINKING ABT MY HEART AT ALL

I got a holter monitor test and the results came back basically normal, then I got another holter monitor and I’m supposed to be getting those results back Monday

My anxiety has been getting better, but everytime I feel like my palps are going away, I ALWAYS get another run. I DONT KNOW WHATS GOING ON.

No way weed could’ve messed up my heart this bad, TWO MONTHS OF SMOKING

Anyways, I just really want to know if this is related to all of that or should I see a neurologist or something of that matter. –
Lately I have been experiencing this sensation like my body is just randomly moving in different directions, it can be from back to front left to right and vice versa like I am on a rollercoaster or in really bumpy seas. I am aware that it does seem to come in times of stress and anxiousness but also, sometimes it doesn’t. It feels like a vertigo, but it also feels different from vertigo,  hard to explain. I can be anywhere doing anything and all of the sudden it will be like a woozy or unbalanced feeling as if I or my soul, so to speak, just shifted in a certain direction or 2 different directions consecutively. I can be laying in bed before sleep and then it can feel like my bed is going down a bumpy road behind a truck… literally. Even if my wife or dog moves on their side of the bed it can cause me to notice it heavily and cause a ripple affect of some sort like I will move around with their movement, but obviously I am not moving at all. Could this be some sort of hypersensitivity due to anxiety or a perception issue? Lastly. Sometimes I can literally move my legs around and/or my hip area and then it will start feeling strange as well like mentioned above.. it feels like I am over sensitive to my own movements at times and it creates a unbalanced feeling. It is good to note that I have never fallen or gotten close to falling, it is not like that. No one would be able to notice this happen from a 3rd person POV. This feeling can be anywhere in the body really actually, sometimes in the back too. Sometimes I do feel out of my body when these happen so yes I am aware it could be depersonalization type of symptoms but can anyone tell me if it is a separate thing maybe?"

Hypochondria,"I’ve always been very in tune with my body and have had the bad habit of deep diving online more than just webMD when it comes to questions I have of the body and overall health. Of course, the terrible spiral of a rabbit hole of symptoms that can be associated with a ton of things.

I know I have health anxiety and I know when it’s happening but sometimes it’s hard to tell which is happening first. My body temp is usually in the mid to upper 97°s, the other night it was 96.7 and this morning it was 98.3. That seems like a big shift, granted it’s winter and the heater is on to 72-73°F. Yet, my eyes feel dry and that dry ‘burn’ when I close them, hot flashes come when I get anxious yet me temp is 98.1-3. I know that’s normal but I’m obsessing about taking my temp. I don’t have any other symptoms, just the fast heart rate, hot sensation, dry mouth and eyes despite good water intake, clear urine, etc. just anxiety and overthinking? What symptoms do others go through? 

Ive averaged 4-6hours of sleep the past 4 nights too, can circadian rhythm be off and affect body temp?"

Is there any way to help get this to stop?

195cjr2,Anxiety,2024-01-13,I'm so fucking useless I'll die in my comfort zone,"20f, shitty fuckin living situations lately. I had an apartment with a roommate who left suddenly,taking my washer and dryer and insisting I give them 300$ so I did. The rent was completely unaffordable but my anxiety and other mental fucking deficiencies made me not find another roomie. I lost $6,000 paying for the rent alone. 

Afterwards, I had to live in a horse trailer in my parents driveway for a couple weeks with no heat in 20 degree weather. It was cramped, smelly, I had no food, and no running water so everytime I needed the bathroom I had to get fully dressed and head upstairs in the house and back. 

Now, after all that, I have to live in my grandparents basement where my loser uncle also still lives with his parents. Our rooms are close, we share a bathroom, we work at the same place, he drives me and back. My anxiety is so bad I refuse to eat or leave my room, I won't go upstairs to see them because they're ALWAYS up there, I won't turn the volume on my TV or phone, I won't sleep with a blanket because it's loud and they might hear me shuffling in bed cuz I'm ALWAYS IN FUCKIN bEd. Also I can't close my bedroom door since I have my cat. I've only been here 3 days and I'm hungry, sad, scared, alone, and severely uncomfortable in every sense.

(More random rant not necessary to read)

I had family come down last week and I hid in the corner of my bed as silently as possible so they would think I was asleep the entire time. My little cousin kept screaming to try and ""wake me up"" and her and my grandma wouldn't LEAVE FROM MY ENTRANCE DOORWAY, for literally half an hour, cuz they were trying to play with my cat who was hiding. Like me lol

They tell me I can't keep my TV on if I'm not watching it, but watching kids movies at all times is a safety net I've had for my anxiety since I was 5. Immediately when I got here my uncle was telling me his ""bathroom schedule"". 

I bought snacks to hide in the room so I wont starve, but I accidentally got loud things like crackers and bags so I can't eat them until they leave the house. 

I bought a bag of ice because I have a horrible problem eating about 10 pounds of ice a week, also a safety crutch thing it just helps me feel better, and they told me to put it in the outside freezer which is guarded by the house alarm that wakes everyone up with ""alarm off, leaving house. Alarm on, entering house"" 

I can't even imagine what it'll be like when I have to do laundry upstairs, or if I'm forced to have dinner with them, or they tell me to do something. If I didn't wanna kms before this has definitely helped🔥"

195c4qx,Anxiety,2024-01-13,anxiety’s rlly bad recently and i’m not allowed up on my meds,"gonna be a long one 

So i’ve been on 20mg of fluoxetine since may last year and it worked wonders for me. my panic attacks completely stopped, no more shaking, the heavy anxiety nausea that happened 24/7 lessened and i was able to sleep properly again. 

That stopped a few weeks ago when i had a panic attack in the car while on the moterway and since then it just kept going down hill. almost all my symptoms came back and especially this past week, i’ve been too anxious to do anything(even shower regularly). doesn’t help that i went to college every day this week but i’m still under a lot of stress since i have to retake my english and maths exams. 

Today and yesterday especially i’ve been a mess. going into college a couple hours late due to my anxiety, then when i get to college i’m too anxious to even function properly and i end up skipping my maths and english classes. i’m a figure skater so i travel 45mins every Saturday for my lessons, meaning in don’t get a break inbetween my week of college, and then ice skating. I also have to leave the house at 7:30 which is super early for me and mornings make me feel sick from anxiety.

Anyway i’m just struggling a lot even when i’m in my own bed. I’m nauseous all of the time, so i skip meals, but then i’m nauseous because i’m starving. 

I went to my doctor yesterday and asked up on my meds because i’m struggling and i was refused due to my age being 16 and it was dangerous to go over 20mg (not sure why). instead he told me to keep taking propanol (which does nothing for me). Fluoxetine is what kept me alive last year. But now it’s just not enough. idk what to do i can’t go back to feeling how i did last year. that shit traumatised me. 

Anyways i’m saying this now bc i have ice skating tomorrow morning and i’ve felt awful tonight, scared that when i go ill be trapped in the car 45 minutes away from home with no way to escape to or anywhere ti calm down. 

Fuck it i’ll go to sleep and pray that i feel absolutely fantastic tomorrow morning. i cant skip it since my mums paid for 6 weeks of lessons."
195bzfd,Anxiety,2024-01-13,Does anyone else feel like this?,"So for a little background. In the beginning of December maybe a little before I was totally fine. I mean I’ve suffered from anxiety for as long as I can remember (I’m 24 now) but this is the worst it’s ever been without a reason. It was a normal day I had just finished cooking dinner and went to take a nice hot shower when all of a sudden in the middle of my shower I started to feel really nervous and faint. I immediately got out and had a panic attack (the only time I’ve ever felt like that is during a bad storm, somewhere that makes me uncomfortable and the first time I ever smoked marijuana). I was fine for a few days then had another panic attack out of nowhere. I got so scared the very next day I called my GP and made an appointment. She gave me 10mgs or Prozac which only made me worse but I stuck with it for 3 weeks (it gave me multiple daily panic attacks, heart palpitations, shaking, trouble breathing, loss of appetite, i honestly couldn’t even get out of bed) then she switched me to Wellbutrin and I had no relief and started feeling even worse so she stopped me cold turkey. 

So now I do feel a little bit better but I still don’t feel quite right. My head feels like it’s being squeezed, my throat still feels a little tight, I can’t focus on anything for too long, i feel more sensitive to light, doing normal tasks makes me winded, dizziness, derealization and depersonalization, confusion, and sometimes my neck, jaw and face tingles. Is this normal? Has anyone else experienced this? I do have a psychiatrist and I did get bloodwork done but I’m waiting on the results. Any advice would be greatly appreciated 🩷"

195b8lr,Anxiety,2024-01-13,Really bad health anxiety over possible skin cancer,"I’m seriously freaking out and can’t stop having panic attacks. I went to see my doctor on Wednesday because I wanted him to look at a couple of moles I had that looked different. The moles turned out to be normal but he said the birth mark I have on my leg looks suspicious because it’s 7cm, has a bump and a few dots in it. It’s always been the same size, that’s never changed. The dots appeared a year ago I think. 

He sent off a referral and it’s normally a 2 week wait but because of Covid slowing things down, it can take up to 4 weeks. Today I got a call to book in my appointment which will be on the 22nd of this month. I know to a lot of people being seen quickly is good but to me it’s bad. 

The doctor said 9 times out of 10 these turn out not to be cancer but I’m terrified! It doesn’t help that he sent me a text to say he’s sent the referral and then a link for more information and the first thing the webpage says is “PATIENT INFORMATION FOR URGENT SUSPSECTED CANCER REFFERAL”  although when I read further down it did say most people who come to us don’t have cancer and I know they always fast track these things. I’ve had moles checked twice before and each time I go somewhere (normally the same place) and I don’t know what they use but they look at them up close. This time it’s a different place and apparently they will take a picture of it and send it to a consultant to look at. 

Everyone (family) keep saying my birth mark looks normal and I can attach a pic if I’m allowed to but the referrals feel different. I’m a worrier and omg am I panicking. I keep being sick because of the panic attacks. My heart aches. I’m so so scared it will be cancer and I will die.

I just keep crying  and saying “I have cancer” and everyone keeps hugging me telling me to stop being silly but I just know it…

195aj29,Anxiety,2024-01-13,Scared of possible mean psychiatrist and meds,"My therapist told me I should make an appointment with their psychiatrist to get on meds because I‘m feeling awful and lost my will to live. I told her that I don’t want to take meds and she told me to think about it.
But I‘m so scared about it. First of all I googled the psychiatrist and she has awful reviews only 1-2 stars out of 5. This made me very afraid. Some reviews said that she made patients cry and is very harsh and not understanding. Yet some said she’s good. There isn’t an option to go to another psychiatrist.
Also I‘m worrying that it‘ll make my anxiety worse because I don’t trust doctors and feel like she‘ll mess up and give me the wrong medication.
I don’t know what to do anymore. I feel like my therapist also doesn’t know what to do with me. I get that I‘m putting her in a difficult situation because I have nobody to care for me and I’m so stubborn and already almost given up and I don’t want her to get in trouble if something happens or worse send me to a hospital.
My anxiety is affecting my whole life, I can’t find friends, I‘m alone all the time, I can’t go to places, I can’t do the things I want and it takes up so many hours of my day because sometimes all I can do is sit and wait for the anxious feeling to pass.
Also if i give in to taking meds I feel like I lost and all these years fighting were for noting because I always said I don’t want to take meds and I could still live without them. 
I obviously don’t know a lot about anxiety meds but I feel like they‘ll change my personality and they‘ll make life seem like an illusion but deep down there will always be this fear. :("

I constantly feel like I've just ran a marathon and am completely out of breath, I have palpitations that sometimes make me think I'm going to have a heart attack, I feel constantly nauseous and when I finally fall asleep I wake up in a panic a few minutes later. I have also recently had suicidal thoughts, I don't want to die but I just want these feelings to end and I don't know how to get rid of them (reassuring everyone, my boyfriend knows this, I forced myself to tell him because I don't trust myself right now, he's really supportive and takes good care of me, I know I'm not alone).

I'm seeing my doctor on Wednesday and my therapist in February but the wait before the appointments is unending. I want the anxiety to go away now but I'm completely lost.

Does anyone know what I can do to at least calm these thoughts and in the process calm my anxiety even a little?"
195a9dk,Anxiety,2024-01-13,Psychiatrist,I've been pretty depressed and have high anxiety lately. I sometimes cry for no reason.

I'm going to start a course of 5-htp anyways.

Unfortunately I've been away for 3 weeks and haven't been able to see her this week either because I had exams. I still have a couple of days to go until I see her next week and health anxiety is eating me alive. It's fine when I'm around other people, but I know I'm gonna have a hard time doing anything except worry about my health this weekend. I'm also actually sick with something and I keep convincing myself I have meningitis which doesn't help lmao. She talked me through some grounding exersices and things for heart palpitations, but the main way I'm affected is insomnia and I dont really get panic attacks often. Any tips to take my mind off this before I can see my therapist?"

1959pry,Anxiety,2024-01-12,Bizarre leg pain for over a month. Comes and goes at random.,"I genuinely don’t know why I’m having leg pain and I’m really starting to believe it’s psychosomatic.

I’ve easily had over a dozen anxiety symptoms everything from dizziness to palpitations to digestive issues. All of this has gone away with time.

The one thing that hasn’t gone away is this leg pain. Once it went away for an entire week. Then it slowly came back.

Exercise doesn’t make it worse it actually helps a little bit. Rest doesn’t make it better. The pain is never in the same spot. It often moves around sometimes in the same hour. Then it goes away only to return again.

I got bloodwork done over a month ago and everything was completely normal. I think I’m gonna go to the doctor again just to get some stuff ruled out. I know for a fact anxiety can cause aches and pains. This leg pain is very annoying."

 and numbing pain/ tingling in my arms and my fingers felt numb. I talked to my mom and she suggested I get to an urgent care. I drove to work and asked a coworker to take me to urgent care everything came back fine. I went to my doctor the same day and she noticed an elevated blood pressure. She asked me if I was stressed and I explained that the last two months I’ve been under a lot of stress. I didn’t think this was an anxiety attack as I normally cry until hyperventilate. My question is how do you cope with your anxiety when it takes on new forms? I literally thought I was having a stroke or a heart attack. I was definitely scared. And what do you do when your coping skills no longer seem to work?

1958qgv,Anxiety,2024-01-12,Hitting myself and other “tics”,"
Been having an issue recently with hitting myself.

It started back in 2020. I was at a conference where I had to prepare a presentation with complete strangers, and present to an audience of 1,000+ people. I was having panic attacks that caused me to excuse myself and rush to the restroom. Eventually, at another point where I ran to “get away”, I found a secluded area and started hitting my head and (lightly) banging my head on a wall.

Ever since that event, I’ve dealt with a tendency of repeatedly hitting my head with my hand/palm whenever I think of a memory that causes me shame or embarrassment. I’ve also slowly picked up other “tics”, such as yelling/squealing if I’m by myself (which I sometimes let slip in public if I’m not on guard). Recently, I’ve started blinking really hard as a “tic” since it feels more socially acceptable when I’m in public or socializing. But I can’t really control these urges. An anxiety-inducing memory or thought will pop up and I’ll feel compelled to “tic” in order to provide some mental relief.

I often do this multiple times a day, sometimes multiple times an hour on a bad day. Fortunately, I only resort to hitting myself every few weeks or so.

I find this odd because I didn’t have these issues until a few years ago. I was very socially anxious ever since I was a preteen, but never to this extent.

Anyone else do something similar? What’s helped you curtail it?"
1958mw0,Anxiety,2024-01-12,how to manage breathing/chest pain?,"hi everyone. yesterday, i started to have difficulty breathing and my chest has hurt ever since. i was told by my provider that it's my anxiety, but as of now, there isn't much i can do besides trying to manage it until i can see a therapist.

right now, i have to actively think about breathing or else i just don't. each time i take a deep breath, my chest aches. it's been pretty debilitating since this feeling hasn't gone away since yesterday. 

i've already tried meditation, breathing exercises, yoga, and journaling. i'm trying to stay as physically calm as i can, but it's hard.

anybody have any advice on how to help alleviate a little bit of the pain? (also if there's a point i should do something more if this lasts longer than a few days?)

thank you &lt;3"
1958m7g,Anxiety,2024-01-12,Anxiety as a hairstylist?,"I'm a 23F hairstylist and have so much anxiety at my job. I've been working for around 3 years. When I started cosmetology school, covid soon began too. So I had a large portion of school online. I never did any cuts or colors on any real humans except family. When I first started my job, I learned so much in the first year. I tried to perfect my skills and became very confident in my abilities. However, the social side of it never came naturally and even 3 years into working, I still get super anxious to speak. I try asking questions and putting the attention on my clients and that has helped some with my clientele. But I still find myself freaking out internally with most people. It's the worst when people stare at me or are hovering. I've always been more introverted and when I do speak more with clients I find myself becoming very drained. This past year I decided to start school again so that I can switch career paths (because I have many interests and I feel like this career is not fit for me). It's not that I absolutely hate my job, I do enjoy the artsy hair side of it but the social side of it makes me hate it. I have a constant flow of anxiety even just thinking of coming into work. I guess the main reason for writing this is to see if any other hair stylists can relate to this feeling? Or if anyone has advice on how to ease this anxiety for the remainder of time I'll be working as a stylist?"

1956ntw,Anxiety,2024-01-12,Has anyone taken a benzo every day whilst adjusting to an antidepressant?,"I’ve been on 2.5 mg (I am very sensitive to cognitive medications) trintellix for a little over 3 weeks and have been experiencing increased anxiety (way more than I have before so I know this is a result of my body adjusting to the meds), which I know is common when adjusting to an antidepressant. 

My doctor prescribed me 0.25 mg of Xanax because of how bad my anxiety was (literally I just want to eat so I don’t feel like I’m sick and get malnourished). So I’ve been taking the Xanax for a couple weeks. 

My anxiety lessened after being on trintellix for 2 1/2 weeks so I stopped taking the Xanax every day (I was taking 2 pills a day but now I’ve reduced it to 1 a day and don’t take it every day. I try to not take it unless I really need it). 

If my anxiety hasn’t improved by late next week, I’m going to call my doctor because maybe this isn’t the right medicine for me. But I’m hoping it will continue to improve as my anxiety now isn’t as bad as it was during the first and second weeks of being on trintellix. 

My concern is that I don’t want to be dependent on Xanax. But I don’t feel like I’m dependent on it and I’ve been taking such a low dose and it’s only been 2 weeks since I’ve been taking it.

Does anyone else have experience taking a benzo whilst adjusting to an antidepressant?"

1956lt4,Anxiety,2024-01-12,How can i get away from my narcissistic and verbally abusive mother,"This is about both family and school. My (m19) parents got divorced many years ago when i was about 11 and since then my mom has declined into a very unpleasant person, to put it nicely. She treats me and my younger brother very poorly and constantly yells and calls us terrible things. There have been multiple times when she’s kicked us out of the house because we call her out on her neglect. She is lazy and narcissistic, all she does all day is sit in her bed and order us around and if we call her out on it she calls us names and screams at us. My dad makes a decent amount of money and pays her child support and alimony, but because of that his take home money gets cut a lot. The money she gets for us (more specifically for my brother) is rarely used to pay for our food or clothes or anything child support is supposed to pay for and instead is used for her own personal expenses/interests. I can’t take it anymore, it’s hard for me to save money as i have to go to school and then pay for all my needs like food and clothes.

Here’s the kicker, i am currently going to school at a university not too far from me, studying computer engineering. However the only reason i’m able to stay at the school is due to the financial aid my mother gets. This school is everything to me and it’s my only ticket out of this terrible cycle i’m stuck in with my mother as comp engineering pays pretty well right out of school. is there anyway i can somehow cut contact with her while also keeping the financial aid the government gives to me? My mental health can’t take another 2+ years of bowing down to my mother just to stay in school. I have regular panic attacks about this especially when she hangs the financial aid over my head and uses it to threaten me.

ive been living my life doing the bare minimum cuz i can’t live without routine and without everything being in control or in a particular way. even adding something fun like doing art at the end of the day sounds stressful because it’s just one more thing i have to do now. i don’t understand how people are simply able to live and get through life. i’m constantly so so stressed and it’s hard to manage even the bare minimum most days; everything feels so hard and difficult all of the time and something as simple as going/taking a class takes ten times the energy it does for the average person. it’s like anything that isn’t the bare minimum gives me so much anxiety that it’s easier to just not do then but then not doing them means feeling stuck with life which then just makes it feel like not existing would be easier. all of this is why i can “survive” when i’m at home doing nothing all day besides eat, sleep, shower, watch TV, and lay in bed — cuz all of that “bare minimum” is deemed safe, but the second i do anything beyond (school, work, etc) that my anxiety gets so bad i feel like i wont survive. as a result, i keep ending up in treatment centers and having to leave school (i’m a 21 year old “sophomore”in college). the only time unsafe things become bearable is if i’ve become accustomed to them long enough that i can trick my brain into believing its part of my bare minimum. only when everything off my daily schedule is complete can i truly relax and explore true interests. it’s so exhausting to live like this.

in addition to all of the above anxiety, i’m anxious about being in public, driving, anything related to money, and am constantly ruminating about the future. 

i just don’t get how i’m supposed to exist in a world that wasn’t created for a person like me. i don’t know how i’m meant to get through school or land a job like a “normal” person. but if i can’t figure it out, what am i supposed to do? in this economy?!?

1956bcj,Anxiety,2024-01-12,Normal Celexa Side Effects?,"So on Tuesday I finally gave in and talked to my doctor about my severe health anxiety and panic disorder. She had prescribed me 20mg celexa (i was on Paxil for a few months in 2020, been off since august of that year). i took it that night at around 8pm and found myself feeling very dizzy and nauseas about an hour and a half later. I had my girlfriend take me to the ER and on the way i felt like i was in a dream/not real. kind of “derealized” and had a very heightened panic attack. I had pretty bad cotton mouth and hot flashes as well as being EXTREMELY restless and fidgety. the ER pretty much said i was okay and i just reacted badly to the Celexa (not allergic but also not serotonin syndrome) and suggested i took a benzo such as Xanax but i declined and said id wait it out at home as long as i was fine. I was since prescribed Effexor but i haven’t taken it yet due to that happening. no when i get a panic attack it seems my panic symptoms are heightened and i sort of feel what i felt that night. I’ve never heard of side effects happening that soon. mind you i haven’t taken the Celexa in about 3 days, and that night was my first dose. It just kind of worries me that i still get occasional dizziness spells and what not. I did tell my Doctor about them but she didn’t really say anything about it and just prescribed me Effexor 35mg. any idea why id still be feeling some symptoms (albeit considerably minor) especially during a panic attack? is it a normal thing?"

In October she was in an accident and had to go to the hospital and received a ct scan. Do they do pregnancy tests there? She says she’s been getting her period and got it in December and there’s nothing to worry about. I respect her wish not to talk about it with her, however I can’t find closure. I’m worried about the condom breaking but it’s been so long I don’t remember when or if we were entirely safe. To my memory I always pulled out before climax"

I had SEVERE social anxiety in my youth.

I found out the cause of my social anxiety a few years ago and was able to combat it.

However, I now have some physical symptoms and I believe the cause of this was my constant social anxiety in my youth.

1. My breathing doesn't seem to be working properly. I breathe as if I am asleep. It's like I'm not taking a proper breath.
2. I am always exhausted. No matter how much I sleep.
3. I have a weak bladder.

I eventually got professional help and got better, but in the last couple months have started feeling super anxious again and had a few incidents where I was completely overwhelmed by the feeling.

I started to notice a few months ago, a few white hairs on my head and throughout my beard. I have never had a gray hair before. And these were not gray, they were STARK white. 

And then about a week or so ago, I noticed an entire part of my mustache is gone. Like no hair growing at all..bald. It’s just a small patch but it’s very noticeable. Can stress/anxiety cause this? Could this be from my diet? (Not eating enough).

Looking back after the stress has passed, im aware at how silly and far fetched my fears are,  but in the moment i’m SO convinced and get stressed to the point I can’t sleep or do anything really. I’ve quit vaping due to my anxiety (which is probably a good thing) and just before christmas i had a check up because i had a bad cough and my doctor checked a few other things like my blood pressure, ect and said my lungs sound great (99% capacity or something like that, she used some sort of device to test), gave me a few antibiotics and said it was just a cough that was lasting a little longer and there’s nothing to worry (its gone now). I’ve had no past health conditions, i rarely get sick and can count how many times i’ve had to go to the doctor in the past 10 years on my hand.

As i’ve said, looking back i know these concerns sound incredibly far fetched but i don’t know how to get over it in the moment and stop stressing. Along with anything i see on TikTok to do with health, be it a cancer survivor story or someone just being ill, i immediately think it’s a “bad omen” and i should get checked.

Any advice on how to fix this would be helpful. I am also considering therapy."

For reference, my heart rate would be 120bpm resting, and sometimes when I would lightly exert myself it would jump up to 150+. I had chronic anxiety for years so I became accustomed to it. Now that I am on day two of propranolol 60mg once a day, my resting heart rate is in the low 60’s (59 at one point) and I’m having anxiety over it. I’m just not used to NOT feeling my heart race around. I’m also on Buspar two times a day so I’m sure this is also contributing to the lower HR. I’m asymptomatic so at least that’s going for me."

That said, on january 31st I hit the side of my head with considerable intensity, I didn't have nausea or loss of consciousness, but I still have some pain in the side of my head (the pain comes and then goes again). But the main problem is that I've been under enormous stress because of this (I seem to spend all day thinking about it), thinking that I might have some kind of injury to my brain, and I've been having trouble concentrating and focusing, my memory seems to be worse (maybe I'm exaggerating), and a lot of tension in my scalp and neck. I think these symptoms are related to anxiety, but on the other hand my head is trying to tell me that it could be linked to the fact that I've hit my head. Do you think I should be worried?"

My anxiety &amp; OCD have just completely taken over after a 15-year battle. I've gotten to the point that stepping outside the house is not wise. Always on edge, shaking, nervous, and ruminating, caring what everyone thinks and thinking I'm hated. I'm just a mess and now I can't hide my anxiety anymore and look ""crazy"" now. On two recent times, people at the store have asked if I was ok because I was shaking..  I tried SSRIs in past and they never worked and the side effects sucked.

I am still stressed from that, I was afraid of local anesthesia since I had never used it before.
I survived that! Went good 
However, she prescribed me Lincomycin antibiotics. Now I am even more afraid to take them. My biggest fear is anaphylaxis, I never had it, but I read about it and it became an OCD obsession of mine. So I am afraid of trying out new foods, especially new medicine etc. 
That scares me the most, however there are other possible side effects as well😰
And I live alone. I am scared something will happen to me and there will be no one to help me. The people I am close to are not understanding of my anxiety at all. They always just brush me off and treat me like I am crazy.
So I am thinking what to do... I honestly would like to have a safe person to be with me, especially the first time I take it. But given the above, I lost trust in people. Maybe I will tomorrow morning just go out somewhere public or close to the ER, and take the pill.
I am hella scared...But infections and complications like sepsis also freak the hell out of me!!!

1952jk8,Anxiety,2024-01-12,How to Embrace Your Imperfections,"
“Imperfections are not inadequacies: they’re reminders that we are all in this together.”- Brene Brown

Our imperfections are what makes us human. Our strengths and our flaws are what define us. Nobody is perfect! 

Everyone has flaws! You just have to find a way to live with them (even better – embrace them). But just because everyone has imperfections doesn’t mean it is easy to handle them. 

Sometimes we find it very hard to embrace and accept our flaws. We set unrealistically high standards for ourselves and when we fail to achieve them, we beat ourselves up.

Then We measure our self-worth through our accomplishments. We often find ourselves in denial regarding our flaws. 

This constant obsession that many have with leaving no room for errors and being perfect all the time can be seriously damaging to our confidence and self-esteem. 

If your desire to be perfect all the time is affecting your perception of self-worth and is causing you self-doubt then know that you can benefit from learning how to accept and embrace your imperfections. 

1. Don’t compare yourself to others

Even though we are all imperfect and have our fair share of flaws, we often believe the others are perfect. 

We can feel like we are the only ones not living up to our own expectations while others are out living their perfect lives. 

We might think that we are the only ones struggling; be it with our careers, our diet, or our families.

Much of the blame goes to the emergence of social media. Social media feeds perfectionism and idealism. 

When people with perfectionist tendencies see influencers who apparently have it all, perfect kids, perfect marriage, healthy body, large house, branded clothes, luxury holidays, and successful careers, they instantly start comparing their own lives with the lives of these individuals. 

Or they see friends and peers sharing highlights of their own lives depicting happiness and perfection (which are very rarely accurate accounts of life in general).

And this is where it all starts to go downhill. Comparing yourself to others often turns self-destructive. 

It brings up feelings of worthlessness and envy, low self-esteem, depression, and demotivation. 

Even though it is in our nature as humans to measure ourselves to others, we should learn not to evaluate our own self-worth on the basis of this. 

Author Bruce Hood says, “we formulate our identity — by focusing on what we are not. The trouble is that by focusing on others, we miss our own imperfections.” 

Learn to let go of this harsh self-scrutiny and go easy on yourself. 

Set the same standards for yourself as you set for others. If you feel it is okay for others to make mistakes, it should be fine for you too. 

Don’t hold yourself to unrealistically high standards."

I emailed the interviewer before the power went out to let them know what was going on, and they responded understandably. Power cut off 5 minutes before the Zoom interview.

It's just miserable.,"My anxiety has spiked in the last couple months and my current main issue is just feeling like I can't breathe every single day. It keeps phasing in and out and I can't stop hyper focusing on it. Every day for the last like month or so this has been an issue. Either I get moments where I suddenly get a pang of anxiety and feel like I can't breathe or I'm just super aware of it. Either way I am spending all day from wake up to bedtime just paying attention to my breathing, breathing heavily, trying to take slow, deep breaths, I even have gotten weird tics related to it that I feel like I have to do to feel some level of comfort or safety about it. And of course I'm worried about all sorts of things related to it. My mind just races to ""do I have a heart or lung issue? Do I have some sort of cancer? Did I get some sort of tooth infection that spread because I don't take good care of my teeth? Do I have meningitis or something because I also have neck/back pain (that logically I know I've had for years now because of poor posture)? Is it something else entirely? I've been to the ER twice and my primary care and they don't seem concerned at all but of course I'm thinking ""what might they have missed or not tested for?"" I just started a new job and have been doing training all week and I'm terrified because I feel like it's distracting me too much and going to prevent me from doing my job as well as I probably could have like a few months ago. I legit almost had to get up in the middle of my coworker training me and go to the bathroom or something to have an attack, but luckily I was able to hold it back. I've been better about preventing full on attacks like that, but it has gotten damn close. I don't know, this is about the most miserable I've ever felt because it's just so much anxiety, I'm not sleeping well, I'm worried about how it'll affect my work. I don't know... I'm in therapy now and I'm on propranolol and hydroxyzine and while I haven't had an attack in about a month since starting them both, like I said it's been damn close. I talked to my psychiatrist and got prescribed sertraline/zoloft and I know I need to give it at least a month so I'm hoping it works and will keep working hard to get back to some sense of functionality. I apologize for all of the vent posts I've been making lately, they probably all sound very similar to each other if you've read my others, but sometimes it feels nice to share with a community and know maybe someone else can relate, and hell maybe you might have some advice to share."

1950cn7,Anxiety,2024-01-12,Is health anxiety all in your head?,"As I read other's experiences,  I had some thoughts I wanted to share.

1. This may not be all in your head. Make sure you do your due diligence and see your doctor before just chalking it up to anxiety. With this, be your own best advocate. Some doctors see ""anxiety"" in your chart and jump to conclusions. If you feel a test is truly warranted,  don't be afraid to push for one. Anxiety can be a forced anxiety from hormones, drugs(Rx and OTC), recent illness, injury, etc. Take the time to explore these avenues in a rational way. 

2. The health anxiety loop is a viscious cycle. The anxiety can cause all sorts of alarming symptoms which then make your anxiety worse. Try to break the cycle by only assessing your health when your anxiety is at a minimum or, better yet, not present. 

3. While we know our body better than anyone, Dr. Internet is not always your friend. It can be a horrible crutch that feeds your fears. How many times has Dr. Internet told you have a horrible and fatal disease? If this is you, please break the habit.

4. I have health OCD and am currently seeing a therapist. We are utilizing ERP to reduce my anxiety. Exposure and Response Prevention is working for me but I feel like there some PTSD in there as well. I am getting better with ERP but want to continue with talk therapy after my ERP is complete. I never thought I'd be someone in therapy but it really helps when you find the right therapist. Please don't  be afraid to seek professional help for your mental health.

5. Supplements can help if done correctly. I had a nasty habit of using Dr. Internet, self-diagnosing, researching supps that may help, then loading up from Amazon. While some people can do that in a rational way, my way was out of fear and panic. I had myself taking plenty of things I didn't need and probably made my issues worse. This was part of my OCD response, and my need to ""fix it now."" If this is you, you may need to talk with a professional.


I know for many of you, this is all basic stuff but I just wanted to get it out there. Not only for others but also for myself."

194zzqd,Anxiety,2024-01-12,Can a normal healthy person take escitaloprám (Jovia),"Hi! I(M) have a partner(F) who is recently diagnosed with Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD), she's been taking escitaloprám (Jovia) every night for two days now. Since then, she's always been asleep the whole day, and when she's awake, she feels weird, weak, drowsy, and experiences chills.   
  
She told me that she's hesitant as to whether to continue taking it for 2 weeks (as the doctor advised) or stop it since she can't function during the day. We know that these side effects are common in the first weeks of taking escitaloprám but we are also scared of the possibility that she may develop drug dependence. We asked her psych if she could stop taking escitaloprám and continue her therapy sessions, however, the psych advised her to take the medicine for her treatment.  
  
I told her to continue since it is what the doctor advised, and I noticed that she's been feeling calmer since she took it. I'm also very hopeful that she will experience what other people experienced when they took escitaloprám for a long time which is mostly positive. However, I can't give her proper advice since I'm also new to this, all I can do is take care of her. I don't want her to stop taking escitaloprám before she gets the benefits but I also don't want her to take them just because I say so.  
That's why I had this idea to try to take escitaloprám myself to experience how she feels first-hand that makes her wanna stop taking it, that way I would know where she's coming from. Can a normal healthy person take escitaloprám? If so, what should I expect?

I am a very high stress / anxious person. I thought I had it mostly under control but then the past 3 months i've just been wrecked with anxiety.

The easy answer is obviously to stop being anxious, but at this point it's a vicious cycle of anxiety causing headaches and the headaches causing anxiety.

194ysa8,Anxiety,2024-01-12,Am I wrong for potentially changing my mind about starting medication?,"TL;DR at the bottom

Hi everyone.

In a couple days, I will start my first medication, buspirone. I read that it is very safe compared to other medications, so I asked for it and I was given the smallest dose (2.5 mg once a day to start)

I’m worried that I’m starting medication too soon. I just started therapy a few weeks ago. At first, I was nervous that therapy wouldn’t be enough for my problems during my first couple of sessions. I really want to get rid of this horrible illness, so I felt like I was desperate and jumped the gun too soon if that makes sense. 

But this week, things are slowly starting to turn around. I’m starting to become more connected to therapy and now I’m learning a lot more from it. I’m also trying to incorporate small lifestyle changes that I think will help me in the long run. Starting to feel slightly better this week. 

I experience “brain fog/derealization” often, but I’ve only had maybe 5 panic attacks in my entire life. 99% of the time, I’m able to calm myself down quite successfully so I don’t get these attacks, even though it’s often quite uncomfortable. I get the other symptoms (brain fog/derealization) instead, where I perceive my reality to be dreamlike and distant. 

I don’t know if my problems are really a chemical imbalance in my brain or if they are because of a toxic environment/repeating unhealthy habits. I’ve never had any physical health issues my entire life, and I really do not want to screw up my brain chemistry if I do not benefit from medication. I want my body to be as clean as it can be. 

I’ve been reading plenty of stuff on Reddit about reviews from medication, and it’s been pretty two-sided. Some people say it’s been a lifesaver for them, others say they wish they never tried medication. I’ve also read horror stories about withdrawal too, and basically all the terrible side effects that arises from medication as well. It takes a while for medication to work too. As a result, it made me think that I don’t know if this is something I should be doing at this point in my life. I know there’s a stigma about medication but these stereotypes are legit and I realized these things could happen to me. 

My family is very worried about starting medication, and I understand them. They called me to tell me about their concerns, and it made me worried too.  There’s no going back once you take the first dose IMO. 

I talked with my physician about starting buspirone. He’s very nice and compassionate and gave me all the risks associated with it, even though it’s very small. We agreed that medication would only be a temporary solution, and that I only need it for the more serious symptoms. 

When I get my first batch of medications and I choose to refuse to take it, what should I do? Should I talk to my physician? Will my physician be understanding about my situation? Should I return the medication, or can I save it for later? Can I talk to my physician maybe months later and ask to try it again if my situation does gets worse? We agreed to a follow up in a couple of weeks. I felt like I betrayed my physician about starting my medication.

TL;DR: Requested Buspirone to start as my first medication. Not sure if this is the best decision right now for the sake of both my physical and mental health. Things are slowly starting to get better with therapy and lifestyle changes. Don’t know what to do if I do choose to refuse to take the medication. 

Thanks everyone.

Note 1: I’m interested in trying a beta blocker instead. Me and my physician talked about a prescription for it before, but I was not able to get it back then. However, he said he would be willing to prescribe it if we discussed it further in the future. Can I replace my prescription from buspirone to a beta blocker?"

This has happened to me two or three times over the years and happened again last night. I was sitting on the sofa reading and using my iPad after dinner and, at one point, I laid down for ""just a minute,"" but ended up falling asleep. I woke up a little over an hour later, but didn't remember having laid down and fallen asleep. For whatever reason, it really scared me and the anxiety immediately kicked in -- muscles tensed up, my stomach felt upset, I felt hot and I had that fight-or-flight feeling.

I happened to have some sour candy on hand and remembered that article that ran awhile back about using sour candy as a quick, non-drug remedy for anxiety, so I tried one and it did help. I ended up staying up for several hours reading, though, before I felt tired enough to go back to sleep.

Just wondering if anyone else has ever experienced this and if you were able to pinpoint a cause for it?

I've been under a lot of stress lately for a number of reasons, including a difficult situation with an older sibling, but have had a period of calm for the past 10 days or so until my sibling contacted me again. They have treated me very poorly for years and have been especially unpleasant since our dad passed away several months ago. Most of my interactions with them are extremely difficult and upsetting. Being around them or on the receiving end of their ugly behavior makes me incredibly tense, so to even receive a text message or call from them immediately makes me go from feeling calm to being completely on edge.

I also am wondering if perhaps what I had for dinner or eating too late last night might have caused indigestion which maybe also had something to do with my dozing off and waking up feeling anxious?🤷🏻‍♀️"
194xlhz,Anxiety,2024-01-12,Feeling Overwhelmed and Helpless,"28 y.o male with G.A.D. I am currently a graduate student in a PhD program. I've been going through a lot of life changes and struggles lately. Last month, I was told that I need to master out of the PhD program because I wasn't getting enough done (burnout, fatigue, anxiety). For the past few years, my wife and I have been going through a number of traumas. She almost died with a pulmonary embolism, she recently got diagnosed with an autoimmune disease, and both her parents died in a car accident about 1.5 years ago. Myself, I've been struggling with my own anxiety and trying to stay afloat. Well, now I have SO much more I have to do. I get my master's in May. At that point, I need to have some kind of full time job to help out. Thankfully my wife got a new job as a licensed therapist (the irony!) where she can work from home, and she's going to make pretty decent money once she has a full caseload (and she's getting pretty close. We expect her caseload to be pretty much full w/in the next month or 2. Mental health counseling is in pretty damn high demand). So she can be the primary breadwinner at least in the short-term while I try to find something more permanant. I'm just struggling with all these upcoming changes. I've been a full-time student pretty much all my life, and this will be my first time finding a fulltime job. I'm scared (terrified) I""m not going to find one and we don't have the money to move out of our apartment. I have no idea where we are going to live once our lease runs up at the end of May, and we have to make a renewal decision by the end of this month (seriously, fuck the landlord for having us make this decision SO FAR in advance when I have no idea what my situation in May is going to be). I'm scared I'll make the decision to renew the lease, our rent is gonna go up a bit, and I won't have a job for a few months. And then we will get evicted or we will have to declare bankruptcy or something. Thankfully my brother-in-law is willing to take us and our 2 cats in if it did come down to that. I have so many other sources of anxiety too. Finishing up with my work in the department, a pregnancy scare, I have small cavities that I have no money to fill, my own other health issues, and I just feel like the weight of the world is on my shoulders and I have no idea what to do. I have been seeing a therapist and am currently on gabapentin for anxiety, but it makes me feel like a complete dumbass and it's effects have been having diminishing returns so I plan on talking with my psych to get off of it. Long story short, I have this INSANE fear of the future and the unknown that is driving me mad, and I just want to know if we'll be okay in the end."

194xaxf,Anxiety,2024-01-12,I feel like i don’t know anything.,"Recently, I’ve been told to be in our support team for the employees so if anyone needs help with the job I’m supposed to help them out. My manager is pushing to develop so that I can do any tasks in our department. 

It is stressing me out so much because I’ve only been doing this job for 18 months. I already don’t feel like I know anything and now I’m supposed to help the other employees with things I don’t even know myself. I always have to triple check everything because I don’t trust that I know anything. 

I already struggle to ask for help and I tend to just do my own thing and be in the background and getting praised or noticed by managers and seniors is stressing me out. I don’t want to do well or do badly I just want to be average. 

It is affecting me so much to the point on days when I’m on the support team I can’t sleep because I’m afraid I’ll give them the wrong information they’ll do it and it gets fed back to me. I hate tasking risks and challenging myself.

I don’t even know how I can bring this up to my manager because again I like to be in the background and I don’t ever ask for anything. I just want to clock in clock out and not have to speak to anyone. 

I went from just doing my thing to all of a sudden having random managers contact me to help them train XYZ and do this and that etc. I didn’t sign up for this and this all because my performance was great this year. 

I don’t want to stand out and it giving me so much anxiety. I never wanted any of this attention and I liked just being invisible and in the background.

I don’t even feel like I can say no to these requests because I don’t I have the ability to reject people and I always end up doing things for people even if will negatively impact me. I don’t want to quit my job because for the first time in my life I actually like this job. It is the whole supporting other people that is stressing me out. 

I dread going to work now because of this and I know it sounds silly that something like this is affecting me and my sleep. Idk I just wanted to rant I guess."
194x5xl,Anxiety,2024-01-12,"(tw: shootings, Stalking) My fear of shootings and stalking is stopping me from doing what I want/need to do in my life.","I will start by saying, I've fortunately never been apart of either.

I'm not doing anything with my life the way I want to. I like the idea of starting a buisness, with a physical location, but the fear of shootings (or something of that nature) stops me from doing that. I also want to make videos on Youtube, but the very real chance of stalking scares me. I know thats being fairly optimistic that I'd actually do well/make it big on Youtube, but If I don't think about it now, and if I get to that point, there's nothing/little I can do then.

But like I said before, it's stopping me from doing anything with my life, besides lying around at home and scrolling Youtube, and I'm getting tired of it. I just don't know how to get over my fears. I want to get a job, and I've worked part time-ish and I'll be ok, but if I think of working at full-time at somthing like a grocery store, it all comes back.

And it's not always on my mind, like I can go to walmart or get out of the house 9/10. So idk.

I've seen some advice to get past your fears, but most don't work with the fears I have. At least thats what it seems. I feel like i'm living in fear, and I don't want to regret not doing anything with my life. Any advice would be appreciated. Thanks."

194wx3d,Anxiety,2024-01-12,Bouncy/wobbly legs and head,"Hello guys, first time posting here.

Mid november I had a big and first panic attack that led to severe anxiety and another couple of panic attacks. Thought it was heart related until somewhere in December I got cleared, heart is working perfectly. That somehow calmed me down but around the same time I started to get a little bit of lightheadedness/wobbly feeling when standing still or walking. 

It feels like the bottom of my feet are walking on waves, sometimes I have this dropping/falling feeling.

I’ve never fallen, but sometimes it feels like I do. 

I also have this feeling that when I am lying down my body is wobbly/bouncing when I move around in the bed. It mostly comes from my leg and travels through my body.

I started therapy last week, and I told em my physical symptoms and they told me it’s a popular anxiety symptom.

I’ve had this for around a month now, and im scared of what will happen when I start going to school in February.

Does anyone else have these kinda symptoms?

Tldr:
First panic attack in november
Since then multiple panic attacks and severe anxiety.
Got cleared that its no heart problems

Main symptoms:
- wobbly feet/legs when walking or standing
- feel like swaying when standing still
- feels like my calfs or feet muscles are tight
- when lying down, especially on my bed when I move my legs it gives me this weird moving sensation trough my body.
- when sitting on a chair it feels like my body is pushing me/ feeling like falling for a second or five.

I notice that when my anxiety is low most of these don’t happen.

Sorry for my bad English, not my first language."

I know a lot of you say ease into it but I can’t seem to convince myself that I’m not having heart problems. I went the other day and walked a mile and a quarter at a 12 minute pace on a small incline and slow jogged a little.

194w20n,Anxiety,2024-01-12,I skipped a meal and now I can’t eat anything,"Yesterday I was suffering from some pretty severe doms after my first couple of workouts of the year (after a month off). 
Throughout the day, the pain got worse and worse to the point where I was questioning whether it was workout-related muscle pain or the flu (my entire body was super tight and sore).
I passed out on the train home from work and when I got home, I was so convinced I was sick that I went straight to bed (side note, I have crippling anxiety so that definitely didn’t help).

I woke up this morning ravenous but could only stomach a bagel and some protein powder and yoghurt. All day I’ve felt hungry but when I tried to eat anything, I couldn’t eat more than a few bites. My stomach feels empty, slightly painful and it’s making my anxiety go wild. I know that this all boils down to not consuming enough food/calories and potentially low blood sugar.

This has happened before but it’s been a while and I can’t remember how I got out of this funk. I absolutely hate this feeling and I know it’s all self sabotage but if anyone has any advice, please let me know. 

ps. I’m not sick at all; the doms had me seriously questioning whether I was or not but turns out I’m fine. They were just so severe that I worked myself up."

194uol2,Anxiety,2024-01-12,Viral Infection / Heart Palpitations,"Hello as the title suggests...

I have recently 2 weeks ago had covid... which passed and everything was fine...

 I then also contracted another virus a few days ago which spread through my family and was causing vomiting/diarrhea in the family household for everyone. I suffered from aching body and high temperature also.

I am now feeling okay again but a little run down, but I have started over the last couple of days to have heart palpitations.
Nothing that it causing my heart rate to increase or flutter beats. But instead every 5 or 10 minutes or so, my heart will skip a beat and then continue on as normal.

I have previously had health anxiety about my heart when I was 18. I'm 27 now.

I have had an echocardiagram when I was 19 amd multiple ECGs at that time as well and all were normal. 

Is it normal to get palpitations with a viral infection? I still have a bit of a chesty cough left over also which may be causing something?

I've not experienced any pain or dizziness (other than the quick rush of adrenaline you get when you shit yourself when you feel the palps) haha.

Any help is appreciated.

Thanks everyone."
194ugwn,Anxiety,2024-01-12,physical symptom advice?,"How to cope with physical symptoms? 

Hi guys, I 22f have dealt with both anxiety and depression since my early teens, I’ve been in therapy 3x. 

I recently started experiencing physical symptoms such as the following: 

Head/jaw/neck tension (or like a pressure, almost like my skull is being slowly crushed) 

Tingling sensation in face (sometimes on one side) 

Occasional nausea 

Aching limbs (usually legs specifically, which in truth, I often shake out of habit) 

Tight throat 

Upset stomach 

I actually went to a walk in hospital clinic on Christmas Day (whoopee) about my symptoms as I was so freaked out. 

I’d never had anything like this before, especially not the head tension and in honesty, I’d (perhaps foolishly) done a  Google search of my symptoms and was basically told I’d be dead within a year, or had something severely wrong with me. 

I freaked out so much upon reading such descriptions, I vomited. 

Upon an assessment at the clinic, all was fine in terms of my vitals. They asked me if I dealt with anxiety/mental health problems (I hadn’t even considered that being a possibility), they said it was most likely that. 

I booked another appointment with my actual gp and they said the same thing, through a questionnaire they assessed my depression as moderate and my anxiety as severe, I’ve been prescribed Sertraline (picking up today). 

I actually had a massive panic attack about 4 days ago, pretty much out of nowhere, and since then the symptoms have about 90% subsided. 

They do occasionally come back ever so slightly, but with distraction they usually go. 

The problem is I’m a huge, huge  hypochondriac, despite having two professionals tell me otherwise, my brain has become locked on the Google search results (definitely emotions beating logic here) and I am still utterly paranoid that it isn’t anxiety, and I’m frankly doomed. 

Does anyone have any tips on how to calm down about this and not make catastrophe so much? It’s badly impacting my day to day. 

And does anyone get similar symptoms? 

Many thanks !"

I hate how my doctor has told me I have nothing to worry about based on bloodwork but some stupid thing I found on the internet has me convinced he doesn’t know what he’s doing (a doctor I’ve had for years who I trust). I especially hate this familiar loop of anxiety-thinking the anxiety itself is proof that I’m sick, that the anxiety means I have some special spidey senses, increasing anxiety and on and on. I hate that I have to be in that room with a tech who can see what’s going on and can’t tell me what they see as the click click click taking photos.

194twcj,Anxiety,2024-01-12,Have anyone else heard of people who do this?,"Background information: I guess I can describe my twin sister(16f) as “very mentally ill.” Her only friends are on discord(although my friends consider her a friend, she doesn’t interact with them.) and when we’re not at school, she spends most of her time in her room and lays down all day. We try to get her out the house but she barely wants to leave, which scares me. She always thinks that she’s dying and has some sickness even though she’s been to 5 or 6 doctors in the past few months and they all say she’s fine. She says that she doesn’t like her life but does nothing to change. She refuses to take her medication for her depression and anxiety.

With the background information out the way, time to ask my question. When she’s frustrated, she screams and is very mean to my family and me. When me and my mom try to intervene about her behavior, she screams super loudly and just say “NO! NO! NO” like a child. And when she’s sad, she makes these weird cat-like noises. She wasn’t always like this. She used to be very social and had a lot of friends. She didn’t behave like this either. This started like 2 or 3 years ago. Has anyone heard anything about people screaming and making cat noises when upset? Cuz I haven’t. 

TLDR: Twin sister makes cat noises and screams when she’s upset. Is that something people normally do?"

I was going through the potential whys because nothing special happened in life. But then I realized: I don’t take caffeine nor alcohol most of the time or almost like ever. Yesterday due to some visit from friends, I drank: one pepsi, three teas and three beers along with many sweets.

194rifo,Anxiety,2024-01-12,Can anyone relate?,"28 male here. My resting heart rate is always between 42 and 48. Can anyone relate to my situation?

&amp;#x200B;

Out of the blue, one day in October, I woke up with shortness of breath and frequent random chest pain. I was very lightheaded and dizzy. One evening a few days later, I felt extremely nauseous and the pain across my chest increased rapidly. My heart started racing. The pain had me crouching down and clenching my chest. A second wave of even more intense pain followed. I was rushed to ER thinking it was a heart attack. An ECG, x-ray and extensive blood tests were done. I was told to stay overnight for further observation and tests. Cardiac marker tests were done in the morning. No cardiac issues were found. I was simply discharged. The weeks that followed were characterized by constant feelings of doom, lightheadedness, dizziness, random chest pains and blurred vision. I also had what I suspected were panic attacks along with this. The situation worsened. I would go out for a light walk around the block and my chest would tighten and heart start racing. The more I persisted with the walk, the more intense the feelings became. Pain would spread across my chest, left arm, shoulders, neck and jaw in typical heart-attack fashion. I would end the walk, lay down on my bed and the symptoms would very slowly subside. I went to the ER, and once again, no heart-related issues were found. Everyone started telling me that it must be anxiety. Muscles across my chest, left arm, shoulders, neck, jaw and head became permanently stiff and hurt to the touch. I went to see a cardiologist. I did an echocardiogram, exercise stress test and a 48-hour Holter Monitor. All three turned out fine. Nothing happened during these tests. Still, in my mind I was convinced that I would suffer a heart attack at anytime. I wouldn't believe the results. I would research symptoms online over and over. I related to all serious medical conditions I could find. My suspected panic attacks continued to worsened. My left arm would become completely numb, my jaw and head would ache and my belly would become sick. I started needing the bathroom immediately after any of these episodes were over. I would be shaky, aching and nauseaous for a full 24 hours after any such episode. I started getting brief but intense episodes of pressure run through my arms and chest. The back started aching. I was also constantly aware of my heart beat and was convinced that it was beating irregularly and erratically. I would check my pulse and also tried a phone ECG app. I returned to the cardiologist asking for him to identify the problem with my heart. He ordered an event monitor for 12 days. Several events occurred during this time. I returned the episode at the start of the year and am now anxiously awaiting results.

&amp;#x200B;

In the meantime, I went to a psychiatrist and was put on 5mg of Lexapro. I could feel its impact within an hour. I got high, experienced a suspected panic attack, continue getting more palpitations and my anxiety went sky high. Fast forward a week and the side effects seem to have subsided and I am finally feeling the positive impacts of the medication. I still get bouts of strong anxiety and I've had only one suspected panic attack in the week I've been on this medication. I was prescribed a benzodiazepine to take along with the SSRI until it's effects fully kick in. Even though I am starting to feel better, I am still not 100% convinced that it's not a heart issue and I've lately started suspecting SVT. I am awaiting the event monitor results anxiously and hoping for the best.

&amp;#x200B;

Can anyone relate? Do symptoms of your panic attacks vary widely from one to the next? Do you ever trigger panic attacks by just going out for a walk? Did your heart race in some attacks but slow down in others? Did Lexapro (or any other medication) seem to work so fast for you too?

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry for the long read, but I hope to get some insight. Thanks!"
194r5kz,Anxiety,2024-01-12,Anxiety related to bathroom,"So just wondering if this is normal or if other people experience this. I have anxiety related to going to the bathroom, well actually not having a bathroom. I have IBD but it isn't very bad. Most of the time it's constipation where I usually end up going 1 day a week (but like 5 times in that day) except when I need to go somewhere  that requires a car drive. Then I don't have a bathroom, what if I need to go? And then often I have to go right before even though it's not my day. 

I guess it's the anxiety of not having access to it. 

Not a joke. Serious. Just wondered if anyone else has bathroom related anxiety."

Yesterday I had quite a good day and I was hopeful things get better, but last night I woke up at 4am and had racing and weird and confusing thoughts, like images, melodies, sentences, dialogues, everything and nothing at once. That scared me so much, that I got muscle spasms again and a little firework in my inner eyes… 
and then at 8 I had to cancel my doctors appointment and now I am not able to go to university. The thought alone overwhelms me. 
I am sad and disappointed in myself"

now my anxiety is even worse. has anyone else gone through this anxiety or had these symptoms? how did you overcome this anxiety? i’m spiraling out of control"
194q9sd,Anxiety,2024-01-12,Anxious until I eat,"I’ve been noticing recently that every time I have an anxiety attack for “no reason” the reason is actually that I’m starving. I don’t feel hungry at all but when I eat I realize that’s why my body was so anxious. in the mornings, as soon as I hear a noise or someone talks to me, my anxiety goes through the roof and I physically cannot bring myself to speak. I usually have to force myself to eat and then I am able to handle the noise and am able to talk. 
Does anyone else have this problem?! I really don’t think it’s just an anxiety disorder, it has to be a bigger issue

194q1d4,Anxiety,2024-01-12,I can't decide wheter tobstart medication,"Hi,

I've been house bound for almost three years now. I suffer from agoraphobia, emetophobia, I am a germophobe, have a lot of panic attacks, health anxiety,..

I have tried talk therapy, cbt, exposure therapy and emdr. Nothing seems to work. 

I have tried to start taking paxil, since I had been on it for seven years but stopped to get pregnant, but had overwhelming side effects. I have been described several other ssri's but was too scared to take them after the paxil thing. Nausea is the worst for me.

I have been thinking about starting Zoloft now. My psychiatrist prescribed a low dose to start with, to lower the chances of side effects (12.5 mg) and after a week I have to increase to 25, then 50,..

But I am scared of those side effects, if I am going to be able to ever come off medication if I need to and if it's safe to take xanax with it, because I'm definitely going to need it.

I am tired of this life and I want to go back to old me, but I keep thinking maybe I can do that without medication. Even though I've tried a hundred times already.

Any advice/thoughts?"

194p5s9,Anxiety,2024-01-12,Fear of being in the prodromal stage of schizophrenia,"Let’s me start by saying I already have a solid mental health team (psychiatrist and therapist). I also am officially diagnosed with hypochondria, GAD, panic disorder, and ptsd. I have had SEVERE anxiety all my life, especially health anxiety, it has made me completely housebound before in the past  but I’m having new symptoms and they are scaring me. Has anyone here ever had this same fear/obsession? I feel like my brain is fried, my thoughts feel scrambled, I just feel so out of it. I feel like I can’t think, I feel lethargic, I have become super sensitive to everything, anything triggers a fear response in me, I can’t concentrate, some days I feel so restless that i just want to crawl out of my skin. I feel like I’ve become socially awkward and more self conscious. I feel like I am having trouble forming sentences and carrying on conversations and I’m not sure if it’s because i have become so hyperaware of what I’m saying   because i am always on the look out for symptoms like “disorganized speech” and stuff. I’m constantly having mind pops of completely random memories, I’m having racing thoughts and so many more symptoms. I just don’t feel like me anymore ): I feel like I will never be normal again, but at the same time I can’t even remember what normal is like. I have been deep in this schizophrenia obsession for about 5 months now. If anyone can relate, please comment."
194ozwc,Anxiety,2024-01-12,Not wanting your dead body to be looked at after you die,I would just like to know if anyone else has thought about how they are going to die and if they don't want anyone to look at their body after they die. The thought of dying and then people viewing me as a lifeless corpse and nothing else just upsets me and makes me want to die in the wilderness. Just wondering if this has been on the top of anyone else mind recently
194ozev,Anxiety,2024-01-12,I will overcome this anxiety. I am resilient.,"**Thoughts**:

I'm heading straight into a situation set for failure. Standing and waiting means the mountain will keep building up even more. If I'm going to fail anyways than I'd rather fail forward; fighting.

All of it means nothing. No what matter what my expectations were, they were all meaningless. 

Everyone fails. Does that mean it's not worth it? Was there any meaning in the attempt? Would I say that to my past self? Was his effort meaningless?

FUCK NO. It's me who gives meaning to my life. The me from last year. The me from before then. The one searching to grow and change. It's me who brings meaning to the effort of my past self. The one brave enough to dive head first into the unknown for a better life despite all odds and fears.

The one who will make the effort of my past self meaningful is ME. I'll dive in head first trusting my future self to carry on the mantle. This is the only way for me to survive this. 

I have goosebumps rn. All I have to change is what's inside. I won't wish it was easier. I'll wish to be better. I won't wish for fewer problems. I'll wish for more skills. 

Ultimately, what happens, happens to us all. The key is what I do about it. Now...

**Here's how I Plan To Fail Forward:**

It's a private plan so I deleted it and posted it somewhere else to follow for tomorrow :)

*Ignore this complaining woe is me bullshit:*

~~Original title: I feel like I've check-mated myself with an anxiety prison.~~

~~There's no escape for me from this anxiety. I feel genuinely helpless. I need a pause button.~~

**~~I've basically checkmated myself with my own goals:~~**

* ~~I have two jobs with tasks that are piling up...I'm working 9am to 9pm every week day.~~ 
* ~~I booked one date for Saturday, and one date for Sunday.~~
* ~~I'm celebrating a friend's event with a group on one of those days.~~
* ~~My work will only continue piling up next week and getting tougher.~~
* ~~I have a fuck ton of chores that I need to catch up on this weekend somehow.~~
* ~~I booked one date for Saturday next week, and one date for Sunday next week.~~ 
* ~~Another friend wants to invite me to some group event possibly next weekend.~~
* ~~I'll have a fuck ton of chores that I need to catch up on this weekend somehow.~~
* ~~I have a MILF who might DTF in the car but I don't want cancel on my current dates.~~
* ~~I booked a date for two weeks out and now I need to maintain some interest because she's needy.~~

~~There's no escape. It's all fucking anxiety.~~

~~Note: I'm talking pessimistically but just ranting. I'd rather suffer 100x than give up on life. What can be more precious than living?~~"
194oxju,Anxiety,2024-01-12,Hi guys! Wondering for any advice to burn up days fast if waiting for something?, Hi guys. So basically I have been waiting for surgery all my teen years and now a doctor finally got me into orthopaedics for surgery which has been set place since December and surgery is now in 10 days in 6 minutes! This day will be 13 days from my 18th birthday I’m so anxious for this day I have been counting down each day multiple times a day I can’t get this off my mind! I have 10 more days left I waited way longer with the unknown feeling of not knowing if I can get surgery or not but holy crap 10 more days. How can I speed up this time? I have been learning lua language lua is coding to create games it’s hard as shit but I think it’s keeping me occupied while being off of work as I got nothing to do plus I find it cool. I’m 17 in a brand new city dropped out of school due to my life like I couldn’t workout or anything until this big day coming. My life is gonna be so much better after this I’m going to be able to get my job back and make money and also workout this is my dream life I can’t wait
194ow0b,Anxiety,2024-01-12,I didn’t fall asleep until 6am last night because of crippling fear of dying in my sleep! Advice on how to overcome this?,"(I’m 23F) An overwhelming sense of impending doom overtakes my body when it gets late at night cause I know that’s when I’ll have to go to bed. And for the past week, I’ve had this terrifying intense fear that I’m going to die in my sleep. For the past two months, I’ve also been dealing with crippling health anxiety and think that something is life threateningly wrong with my body all the time to the point where I’m getting exams and tests left and right. Now in this past week, I’ve developed this fear that all this intense panic and anxiety that has been debilitating me for months is going to kill me. I’m also overweight and prediabetic so I also worry that that will kill me one of these nights combined with the panic. My mom and dad continuously reassure me that I’ll be alive the next day and wake up like any other day, but it’s unfortunately not enough to calm me down. The fear was at its peak last night as you can see by the title because it took me that long to be calm enough to eventually sleep. I was 100% convinced I was gonna die in my sleep last night. The fear has gotten so bad that I have even left a note by my bed telling my family how much I love them if they come in my room and I’m dead. It’s exhausting having this daily fear that I’m not going to live to see the next day. I am currently seeing a therapist but she obviously can’t see me everyday, and this is a crippling daily fear like I mentioned. Lastly, I understand that we’re all gonna die someday. I get that. But I’m 23 and feel far too young for my life to be over already. I have not reached my potential of where I can go with this life and don’t want it to end so prematurely. Has anyone in this thread experienced the same thing and/or what advice do you have for me to take steps to overcome this fear? Anything you can offer is very much appreciated, thank you so much!💕"
198bno3,Anxiety,2024-01-16,"Anyone else taking buspar, hydroxyzine and lorazepam/alprazolam? Can we have all thee at once?","Buspar intake morning and night every day. The other are as needed, up to three times a day. I think the idea was the benzos are in case of emergency and hydroxyzine can be a second daily med if needed. 

The thing is, lately I’ve been getting hammered with anxiety. Today I took buspar and hydroxyzine but they’re not cutting it. I want to take lorazepam to bring me down from an anxiety attack but don’t know if all three is too much. 

Hydroxyzine makes me so damn tired and gives me a headache. I’m not sure I can stick with it. Can’t get any work done on it, though can’t work while anxious as shit either."
198bmnd,Anxiety,2024-01-16,Had my first anxiety attack in school:(,"I was in math class, just doing my work, when I started to feel unnaturally hot, tingly, and as if my breathing was laboured. And I started to shake too, and could feel my heart. God it was terrible, My first reaction was to not tell anyone, since I feared that they'd act like my mom and say it's ""not a real panic attack"" since when my dad had one (mom goes off what dad experienced) he had taken something (some sorta substance)  and turned red. So because I'm not gasping on the floor convinced I'll die it's not real. The bell rang and I went to a trusted adult (not gonna say his name, but he helps with job searching and other things). I asked him ""what's the best thing to do d-during an anxiety attack?"" He then tried to get me to take a deep breath, and then he sat me down. He even let me sniff some essential oils if it would help. I'm just glad to have someone I could go to. :)"

198451w,Anxiety,2024-01-16,"anxiety is making me feel like i am losing my mind, or will do soon.","honestly, i have anxiety ever since i could remember especially dpdr. i am not professionally diagnosed because my parents don't really get it. they think it's all in my head. mind you, i am 18. i had a really bad dpdr episode back in November 2022 which lead to a panic attack in the middle of the night. 

ever since than, i am being hyperaware about everything. after some time i developed this vision issue, i see glitches sort of everywhere, floaters and dots and stars in peripheral vision. after seeing an eye specialist, they told me my eyes are fine but i see blue in distance. idk what it's called but the number is 1 in a eye and 0.5 in a eye. 

fast forward to April 2023, i was managing my anxiety pretty well, i still had dpdr episode, panic attack in between but they were less. but i had this fear of ""what if i go crazy?"" it always manage to scare me. after a panic attack. 

i was going pretty well till two days ago. i started watching this j-drama ""me.hiiragi's homeroom"" it's a psychological thriller and mystery show. after watching 2 episodes that day(before sleeping) i woke up in the middle of the night half sleep and my mind was thinking about that show as if i were a part of it. it was so weird that after i woke up panicking, i couldn't remember what exactly i was thinking. i was so confused, why where i thinking like that. it got me panicked enough to stay sleepless till morning, searching reddit like crazy. 

last was similiar. since i was continuing the show. last night i woke up around 01:57 (i sometimes take ss so that I know I was not dreaming about waking up in the middle of the night) i check the time and went back to sleep, again..my mind was rambling, i couldn't stop it and woke up again in panic (the rambling was happening when i was half asleep, i believe) and when i check the time, it was 02:03. only 6 minutes had past but felt like hour. i panickedly woke my sister crying, she was asking what happened but i couldn't answer at all. i was confused, exactly what was I thinking? it was so odd, i remember that i had this feeling last night..it was not only dpdr but as if i am going to d*e or as if i lost my mind. with all this feeling high, i got this thought..what if i su**de because of it? everything felt so odd i couldn't stop crying. after a while somehow my sister managed me to calm down. but somehow managed to sleep.

and now, i can't seem to get these thoughts out of my head. what if i go insane? can't control myself and end up doing something I should not? what if i s***de? everything gets so overwhelming i don't know what to do."

197ukbb,Anxiety,2024-01-16,I’m having a panic attack. Again.,"I don’t know what’s up with me but these past few weeks my health anxiety has been going so wild. The wintertime is usually like this for me (seasonal depression I suppose?) and it doesn’t help that I’ve lost a couple family members  a couple years ago during this season to very, very rare diseases. (CJD and AML) I have a supportive family, friends, and boyfriend, so I don’t know why I feel so lonely. They all know I struggle with this and are well equipped to help me when I need it. 
Lately I’ve been having on and off ice pick headaches that are driving me off the rails. They aren’t severe and they aren’t constant, but headaches are so scary to me and I always worry I’m having a stroke/aneurysm/brain tumor. When I panic I give myself symptoms like numbness or something else worrisome and then I launch into full blown panic. 
I just was browsing here on Reddit and came across a post about someone whose loved one died suddenly from cancer after not even knowing he had it until 3 days before dying. I’m so uptight, crying my eyes out like a baby, and don’t know what to do. My headaches worsen whenever I get stressed which isn’t helping atm. Everything feels so overwhelming and scary right now. I need some reassurance."

Omg what if there is a recording of me kissing him somewhere in our apartment ? What will the people in my neighborhood say? What will my parents think of me......

I would just like someone to reason with me so that I stop feeling this way.  

It's like my brain has the logic but it won't stop worrying about it for literally no reason.like why would a fire exist have a CCTV and why would my parents find out after 6 years. Make it make sense ?

They’re on both sides of my head but mostly my left, and aren’t ever constant. They started one day when I was really stressed and then never fully stopped. Again, they aren’t dull but more like sharp needle pains that randomly pop up multiple times throughout a day, some days more than others, and then go away. I stress about the pain obviously which I wouldn’t doubt is making the headaches worse. They’re never bad enough that they take me away from everyday activities, and if I’m distracted I don’t have them. The moment I start thinking about them or hear someone mention something like cancer or brain tumors, the headaches start again. I’m used to tension headaches when I’m stressed but not these sharp ones. I’m wondering if maybe this is from clenching my teeth? I do notice my teeth feel sore sometimes because I’m clenching my jaw at random times during the day. But I’m not sure that would cause sharp headaches. 

The pains have been behind my eyes, the base of my head, behind my ear, and mostly in or around my temples. I’m terrified of doctors and I’m seeking some reassurance here that someone else has experienced this."

195ze74,Anxiety,2024-01-13,"Sudden fear of heart failure, would like some reassurance it’s not (or is??)","Hi I’m a 16 yo (trans) guy with a diagnosed anxiety disorder. For the past few months I’ve noticed how easily I get a shortness of breath when I’m active, like I just can’t get satisfied enough air. I get easily lightheaded too with tinnitus issues. My school has 8 flights of states and if I walk long enough I start to seriously hyperventilate and my lungs feel like their tightening up, teachers get really concerned for me. I’m not even that out of shape, sure I could work out more and my parents only feed me fast food cause we’re basically homeless, but I walk a lot and do many stretches throughout the day. I even practice deep breathing to get to sleep cause of sleep issues or if my anxiety is at it’s worst. I get several aches on my body throughout my day too and I’m fatigued, especially the kidney/ lower back areas and underneath my left rib.

The fear of this was of course triggered by stupid google. I’m currently ill cause likely a cold and I looked up what kind of cough came with Covid cause I wanted to rule that out. Since it was a dry, I simply looked up “how to treat a congestive cough” and then it pulled up symptoms of congestive heart failure which said shortness of breath and lightheartedness. I logically don’t get too bothered by google telling me I have cancer or some shit (usually I go on Reddit anyways cause they aren’t stupid enough to diagnose you with something serious if I’m just needing advice), but this time it seems to have triggered me to worry a little more than usual. I’m just looking for some reassurance or other more minor things it could likely be. Typically I can talk myself out of thinking I’m dying after years of unprofessional therapying my own self, or whining to my parents, but it’s a little worse this time. And no, I can’t go to a doctor my parents won’t take me I haven’t even gone to a dentist for 3 years."

I know my mind has warped these events to be far worse than what they were, and added in false memories that didn’t occur. All of this and these ‘memories’ stem from the fear of those things. In the posts however, I said I had done those things, because I was terrified I actually had and I also wanted to see peoples opinions without thinking it was OCD. Well one of the posts was reported for violating the content policy, and my account was permanently suspended. I totally understand why it was suspended, but now I’m terrified I’m on a watchlist or being investigated for what I claimed I did as a teen.

She was getting my heart beat and blood pressure. She asked me if I was nervous to which I replied not really. She said my heartbeat was pretty fast. Which I notice a lot. Even when resting, my heart races a lot. I don’t know why. Every time I go to the doctor, the nurses always asks if I’m nervous. I don’t have any racing thoughts. I’m legit just waiting for this to be over with but my body seems to still have anxiety? Not sure what to do."

194ndhl,Anxiety,2024-01-12,Passing out from anxiety,"I’ve been diagnosed with GAD and panic disorder since I was 11years old. I’ve had the same reoccurring somatic symptoms my whole life. However, 3 years ago I went thru a very stressful time in my life where I would pass out from anxiety. It stopped after the stressors went away. And I haven’t experienced them since last week. I’m going thru another very stressful time in my life rn. It gives me anxiety just thinking about it. Like I’m too anxious to drive or leave my house, because what if I pass out then? I meet with my med provider tomorrow but she wasn’t able to give me any advice last time so my hopes aren’t high. 
Anyways, I was wondering does anyone else lose consciousness when the anxiety gets too much? I guess I just feel very alone in this. It just makes me anxious as it is and my everyday life is beginning to become more difficult for me to function in."
194n9gl,Anxiety,2024-01-12,Stomach Pain,"Due to a previous antidepressant I took, I experienced a lot of stomach pain and nausea to the point of vomiting almost every day. It took me several months to realize it was the meds and not something else. In that time I had ultrasounds, stool tests, an endoscopy and there was never anything abnormal in my stomach. Of course it was because it wasn’t my stomach but the meds. 

Fast forward now and I’m off the meds and that has made a world of a difference. I no longer vomit daily. The issue now is that, even on no meds, my stomach still hurts sometimes for no reason. Im noticing whenever I feel anxious or have an anxiety inducing thought, it feels like jabs in my stomach. I don’t know how to stop it and it’s making me feel ill. Has anyone else experienced this?"
194n0el,Anxiety,2024-01-12,i want to smoke weed but my anxiety and paranoia over the actual smoking makes it impossible to. i live in the uk.,"i would prefer cbd but thc is more accessible here (for me, i didn't originally say it was less accessible for cbd for me). i've smoked maybe 5 times and it really helped making me chill. stopped my restlessness and really helped calm my mind from doing the zoomies. it killed my excessive dysfunction and just overall made me feel better anxiety-wise. i was less awkward and tense. 

however, i only smoked with 'friends'. i have tried by myself but i was scared to get caught. theres so many anti-cannabis people in my city, if not the whole city. i have tried vaping but it just wasn't for me (maybe if i had the money for a good one but i don't) i would try edibles but i don't know my tolerance or where to get them. 

honestly, my problem is the smell, i'm paranoid over the smell while smoking. for the first couple seconds or so when i have smoked its like i start buffering and someone else had to put out the joint because i forgot (how? no clue its not like i didn't smoke cigs regularly in my early teens, again never myself). i'm not attention seeking like ""i can only smoke in front of others because i like people watching me do it"" but more like i don't want to do it alone. 

how in the hell do i just say fuck it and do it? thats all i wanna know. i just wanna roll it and smoke it and go home but no the stress of the deed is more stressful then my whole school career was. i'm probably just a pussy because its not like i care about smelling like weed, that i don't care about its just doing it. 

i have legit never seen or heard anyone ever talk about this. even those with anxiety i used another throwaway account of mine to ask on the weed sub but was downvoted straight to hell for it. so i'm asking here. i also did check the search bars on the weed sub and this one and no one talked about it.

thanks for reading, i'm so sorry if this is inappropriate."

194mvju,Anxiety,2024-01-12,Ears on Fire,"
Hey out there. I’ve never posted or commented on Reddit… Please, please be nice…

Does anyone have any possible explanations for why both of my ears become SO hot and BURN for hours on end during/ long after stressful/overwhelming/frustrating situations? It happens at any hour of the day, doesn’t change based on setting or people I’m with or stimuli if that’s the right word. This will occur at any given time when I feel those feelings mentioned above. I’ve totally Googled the crap out of this issue… It’s not a medication reaction, I can’t find an allergy in my diet/correlate anything to the times it starts up. I looked at high blood pressure, but I don’t have high blood pressure before, during, or after the episodes, fortunately 
I don’t wear anything on them. I wear earrings, obviously, but I don’t seem to be allergic to the metal... there’s no pattern at all with when it happens. I’ve tried no earrings. Doesn’t change anything. This very, VERY uncomfortable struggle only started after I became pregnant close to three years ago, I would guesstimate. 

This happens each time I become stressed/ticked off/overwhelmed. It takes HOURS to fade away. Only relief I can manage (until they decide to fade back to normal human temp) is placing actual ice on both sides of my ear. Then I fan them when the ice has melted……down my neck and onto my clothes (which I only can do at home with no one to witness this insanity). After this I fan them. The relief only lasts while the ice and fanning are going on…happens every day and sometimes more than once. 

Ideas to relieve it/make it fade quickly…personal experiences… possible reason(s)… hit me with anything you got, please!!"

194mdd0,Anxiety,2024-01-12,Panic attack flying!,"As the plane reached its cruising altitude, my trembling hands clung to the seat's armrests. An overwhelming wave of anxiety consumed me as I frantically rose from my seat and made my way towards the cramped airplane restroom. Locking the door behind me, I fought with the intrusive thoughts that clouded my mind. I visualized myself moving through the air in a small compartment, 35,000 feet above the earth, at a speed of 500 miles per hour. My heart raced, my breath quickened, and I felt trapped in this confined space, mirroring the constant battle within my thoughts. Beads of sweat dotted my forehead as I clutched onto the sink, trying to ground myself. Through sheer determination, I managed to regain my composure, leaving the restroom feeling disturbed. As I glanced around the plane, I couldn't help but notice the other passengers engrossed in their leisurely activities - snacking, scrolling through their phones, watching movies, tapping their feet to music, lost in their books. It momentarily lifted my spirits, providing a small glimmer of solace. But deep down, it only served as a painful reminder of how truly wretched this experience was."

Need words of encouragement &amp; advice,"Hey guys, so I was supplementing my vitamin d and looks like I've developed insomnia from it. I've never had sleep issues before and I'm scared af. I'm especially scared that something is now broken in me and I'll be like this forever.

It's not been that long (7 days of really crappy and less crappy sleep) but I feel absolutely fucked up. I'm tired but I can't sleep. I've only had like 4.5 hours of sleep yesterday and maybe 30 minutes today. My heart is pounding, I can feel this anxiety getting worse and worse with every night of poor sleep. I've tried everything: magnesium, melatonin, exercise during the day, limit caffeine, getting out of bed and doing relaxing activities if I can't sleep, breathing exercises, hot shower/bath, it only helps for a bit and I almost feel like Ihave calmed down, and then it spirals out of control again with full force. I know it hasn't been long but I'm exhausted. I think I was a slightly anxious person before but this whole sleep issue has turned me into a mess. 

It's 6am, I'm thinking of contacting a doc first thing in the morning and asking for an appointment with a psychiatrist and a CBT therapist. I just can't handle it anymore."

I love the team but I love watching them play from the comfort of my quiet home on my tv. I don’t do very well with crowds, loud noises, going out late, or NYC. I had even turned down an offer to go to a game previously from someone else. I was grateful as it’s a really cool gift but a little bit taken aback because he knows I have anxiety and how I feel about that type of environment. He’s seen me rush out of a Buffalo Wild Wings before we could even order because it was packed with people all cheering over a football game.

I keep trying to just tell myself i’ll end up having a good time and that it’s exciting to see my favorite sports team play in person but I can’t help but develop a pit in my stomach every time it crosses my mind. I do have noise cancelling bluetooth work headphones that I will bring with me, or I can purchase earplugs if that’s a better option, which brings me some comfort in terms of the noise level.

194l978,Anxiety,2024-01-12,Is it possible to return to “normal”?,"Hey everyone, I’m suffering from extreme anxiety for the first time in my life. Had my first ever panic attack earlier this week, and since then I’ve been unable to do pretty much anything aside from make some phone calls, send a few emails, and walk the dog. I’m a male in my late 20s. Including tomorrow, I will have missed a full week of my graduate school. 

There’s probably a dozen different smaller factors/stressors/triggers that are contributing to my anxiety, but it pretty much all stems from and/or leads to a crippling fear of death. Again, not something that’s particularly bothered me for as long as I can remember. This is just all so new to me and I’m obviously scared, but I want to know if this is something that is ever truly “handled” or something that I should be prepared to struggle with for possibly the rest of my life. Either this exact fear or just anxiety in general. Really just seeing if there’s any advice or similar stories out there. Open to anything and happy to discuss my situation more in depth. 

I’ve had depression once or twice but never anything too serious, and what I’m feeling now is so much worse and I feel completely helpless. I usually have a pretty chill and positive attitude and have been there for several siblings and friends who have struggled with anxiety, and finally experiencing it myself is just keeping me in a really dark place. I also have adhd/ocd that I usually take medication for. Thanks."

I was googling some of the side effects since I have health anxiety and was worried what it could trigger and some of the side effects are already things I check for. People online were saying that those side effects arent are rare as doctor say so I'm freaking out.

Basically I'm in an endless cycle where I'm anxious, and I have a medication that could help, but if I start getting some of these side effect that are ""rare"" it'll make my anxiety and depression worse.

194j3zf,Anxiety,2024-01-12,Can anxiety attacks carry on for days?,"I (26F) have recently been waking up to instant notions of my stomach growling like crazy and heart palpitations. It’s only been a couple of mornings so far waking up like this but I’m wondering if this is normal? My heart rate takes a very long time to return to normal. A few nights prior I did get an anxiety episode and by the end of the night I was okay. The next morning it felt like the anxiety just carried over and the heart palpitations did not go away until my friend arrived in the late evening. It lasted about 12 hours (Anxiety induced for sure.) The strange thing is— the second morning I woke up feeling okay but the same thing was happening anyways. Same stomach grumbles and heartbeat coming out of my chest but it took a few minutes for this to happen. Could anxiety attacks last this long?

I have been recently diagnosed with GERD about a month now and I’ve noticed my appetite has been less than usual even though I always feel hungry. I haven’t been active at all for those two days— I just stayed home doing very little other than trying to calm down my heart rate. I was also alone most of the duration. 

I’ve tried everything I could think of to cope. Reading, making art, meditating, breathing exercises etc. 

I got out today and made sure I was physically active and with people all day. I even kept notes of how I felt and what I ate. I think I ate exceptionally well today compared to the other days. I just hope it doesn’t happen again when I wake up."

It is over things that previously I could do normally without an issue. I recently developed contamination OCD after a bad bout with Covid 17 months ago, and now dealing with Long Covid. My hands are cracked, red and peeling but I'm terrified of germs and Covid now. 

I am now terrified of planes-just the thought of a flying tube in the sky and completely out of my control. I used to travel at a young age up until a few years ago on my own, little to no issue. 

I went from being able to ride rollercoasters to now having a debilitating fear of them.... The ones at Disney too, safe. I went on one in 2020 prior to the pandemic and my whole body was exhausted....heart racing, heavy breathing and my body was shot for the rest of the day. I used to ride all of them as a child/teenager over and over. 

I was even scared sledding yesterday... I felt ridiculous. When I was a teenager, I had a friend who collided with someone in her sled- she ended up in the hospital with brain damage, short term memory loss and seizures. I've been sledding since then many times then yesterday that fear came up and I broke down. It's been 18 years since that freak incident happened

I went on meds recently and they don't seem to be helping. This is literally running my life and I'm scared of nearly everything .. it's debilitating and I don't want to be like this. Just the thought of some things make my legs and feet tingle, heaviness in my chest, and fear rise up.

However, this anxiety manifested into things like my balance, confidence, and focus. I have been running consistently on the treadmill for about 6 years, it keeps me healthy, happy, and sane. I noticed that I was losing my balance on the treadmill, and that I couldn’t run at speeds as fast as I usually do without feeling like I’m going to fall. I was hyper focused on where I was putting my feet, and eventually I lost the ability to even walk on the treadmill. I am so sad about this mental block, I’m afraid to even step foot on a treadmill again in fear of embarrassing myself.

I don’t think I have ever really dealt with this. I’m 31 years old and don’t have anyone in my immediate family that suffers from anxiety or has to be medicated for it.

Buspirone being the first and Propranolol being the second medication prescribed.

However, during check ups with my psychiatrist he has mentioned that i might also struggle with anxiety and has suggested i start taking ssris. i never thought of myself to be anxious, just an extreme overthinker. i was skeptical of my anxiety diagnosis and starting antidepressants for a while, but then i saw a therapist for the first time and upon revealing only some of the symptoms that led to my adhd diagnosis, they also said i may be struggling with anxiety. after the therapy session, i had an appointment with my psychiatrist and after some discussion he prescribed me lexapro. this was about 2 weeks ago and i still have not gotten myself to start the meds. 

i guess my fear is that maybe i dont even have any of this stuff and i keep trying to fight my issues with meds? what if the source of my anxiety is the vyvanse? i have just felt so at odds with who i am/think i am recently and what it means for starting medication. ik some of these are questions for my doctor, but i also wanted to hop on here and see if anyone has any experience with adhd, anxiety, how they relate, what symptoms led you to seeking a diagnosis as an adult, experiences with vyvanse and lexapro, or any experiences you think might aid me in figuring out how to go about this. thank you"
194gt8g,Anxiety,2024-01-12,"Does anyone else experience ""household anxiety""?","I live with my mother and 3 siblings, and every time one of them does something in the kitchen, I can't help but check if every electrical tool they used is turned off. Like the toaster, the oven, etc. This has gotten worse ever since we adopted 2 cats, since cats are known to lick off every dirty plate that piles up in the kitchen sink and I just don't want to risk them eating something that might be poisonous to them (like chocolate, onions etc.). Also since it's getting very cold and we use our heaters a lot, I can't help but check up if every heater is turned off after someone leaves the house (I recently caught my little sister how she forgot to turn off both heaters in her room over night since she sleeps in a different room and when I talked to her about it, she didn't seem to care at all). It has gotten to the point where I lost a good amount of sleep because of this, and even though I keep reminding my family to please remember plugging everything off and cleaning up their dishes, they either simply ignore me or forget about it, and it causes me a lot of distress.

I tried living alone for some time, but this has made my anxiety even worse for several reasons - so this is kinda out of question.

Does anyone else experience this? If yes, how do you manage it?"

194gkxm,Anxiety,2024-01-11,Anxiety is scary and weird,"Last night before bed, I was thinking about my grandfather who passed away from cancer. I saw him on his deathbed and he is the only dying person I've ever seen. My thoughts had started out as happy memories but eventually became thoughts of his last hours. I had an anxiety attack when I saw him that night, it scared me so bad to see him like that and to realize he wasn't ever going to come back. I knew he was in pain and that he would be at peace but it still scared me. Last night I thought about how I saw him that night, so high on morphine he probably couldnt feel me stroking his foot or kissing him goodbye. I eventually got that thought out of my head and was able to go to sleep after crying a bit. Then I woke up at 11:30 having an anxiety attack. Usually when I wake up having an anxiety attack I think about death and my mortality and it scares me. Last night was no different. My heart started beating hard and fast and I got the familiar feeling of my hands and feet going numb and my stomach and chest burning. My heart was beating so fast I thought I was gonna die (I have a heart condition and my heart was probably going 120-140). I was scared. I took my beta blocker which helped my heart to slow and my fingers to regain feeling. I watched my go to video for when I am having and attack and I was eventually able to go to sleep. I woke up at my usual early morning hour and felt fine. I went to school and cried because I miss him. It's weird but I never fear death in the day time like I do at night, I always feel so alone and cornered at night. My fight or flight kicks in and I always want to run but I never know where to."
194gkgk,Anxiety,2024-01-11,Can’t stop thinking I’m going to get a stomach bug? I’m having severe anxiety over it.,"This sounds dumb, but I’m coming down from a common head cold and on steroids. A coworker of mine who just got over a stomach virus said she had some pedialyte I could have that was unopened and unused. I have a really hard time saying no and accepted it thinking what could be the worst that happens? 

Well I cleaned the bottles with spray alcohol hand sanitizer then wiped them down with alcohol wipes. As soon as I got home I sprayed them with Lysol too, but I freaked out because a few hours atter the first two times of wiping them down, I touched my nose ring to adjust it and didn’t wash my hands yet. 

I’m now freaking out I’m going to get the stomach bug from her via these unopened bottles. I sprayed them heavily with Lysol and am going to let them just sit for a while and probably not drink them right now. 

I already missed 2 days of work this week from the head cold and now I’m panicking that I’ll be sick and miss more work. I’m writing this literally shaking because I’m so anxious. I know if I was exposed then it’s just a waiting game to see if I get sick but I’m making myself sick just worrying about it."
194gei4,Anxiety,2024-01-11,How do i know if i have pure task avoidance anxiety vs ADHD,"Hi guys, so I have struggled with anxiety a little before the pandemic era  began (late 2019) and got worse until end of 2022. I got diagnosed with ""undiagnosed mild anxiety"" as my doctor put it about 2.5 years ago. 

That said i suspect I have ADHD for 3 months now for very strong reasons yet i constantly wonder if I'm faking it or looking for an excuse and that i might have somethingelse or nothing at all.  Im trying to get a diagnosis but its about 6 months out. That said I remember how badly i struggled with avoidance coping during the pandemic era to the point i failed classes. That said i looked up task avoidance anxiety and looking for advice.  So how do i know if i have pure anxiety vs adhd?"

194g23u,Anxiety,2024-01-11,Can one bad trip of weed give you health anxiety?,"1. I used to enjoy weed alot when a year ago. I was 15 back then and my friends got me into it and i thought it was the best thing ever since i suffer from anxiety in general and it would take my mind of my stress. I would say i was addicted to it but i did take 2 day breaks every week as if i thought that way im not addicted. I used to smoke it every chance i get though. I would get pretty bad withdrawels everytime i took the breaks but i always brushed it off as its just the withdrawels and ""go through it"". It was great until i got my hands on edibles. I took a tiny piece of the trolli candy as stated in the bag it was 100 mg each one.  They didnt have any affect on me which im assuming now is cause i had a high tolerance for weed already. However i made a mistake which changed my life . one day while i was really high i decided i wanted to take the full gummy ( at this point, i thought they were fake). Worst decision , next thing you know im thinking im going to die. I was gonna call 911 but ended up telling my parents. It was so bad i couldint even speak my mind out as i wanted to tell them but didnt want to at the same time. I was scared but also scared i was gonna die if i didnt .  I ended up telling them and they got mad but calmed me down.  I had non stop panic attacks for about a weekl after that. i couldint go to work nor focus on anything. Went to go to therapy but stopped after since i thought i was fine. Everytime i felt a pain or felt something was wrong, i would immedially start thinking ima die. Went to the hospital one really late night  cause i had arm pain and thought i was dead since i kept looking it up and google saying im having a heart attack lmfao . I stopped having them but my anxiety increased i would say . I still smoked after a month but until recently i feel like i shouldint so i dont really like smoking now . I can really only smoke when im with friends as i feel calm and arent paranoid depending on how much i do . I was more focused on my health than i ever was. Any little pain i would overthink it . Still affecting me a year later, i say it has gotten worst since im actually writing a post about it when i thought i never would lol but i dont think its affecting my life to much as im mostly calm if im with somebody or talking with them. But if im alone it does affect me.  I have been trying to improve myself  and work out as im not overweight but wanted to feel better about myself but lately dont have the motivation now.   I dont know if i should go back to therapy or just stop smoking for a while and go through it. I dont really wanna go back since i know it cost my mom  money for it so i would feel embarrased tryna ask her if i can go back. "
194g02p,Anxiety,2024-01-11,My anxiety has been acting up…,"
The past two days my anxiety has came out of no where after a few weeks of feeling great. 

With that being said, I have been getting these shocks in my chest today. They come and go and very random. I’ll get them when I bend over, walking or even just sitting down. 

Has anyone else experienced these? When it happens they literally last a second but they make my anxiety even worse! I hate it so much."

194fkx1,Anxiety,2024-01-11,Do you shake when you wake up? Is it happening all the time and I just don’t notice?,"I’ve been experiencing mostly physical symptoms of anxiety off and on since the start of the pandemic. After losing my dad unexpectedly to an overdose in 2021 (I was the one who found him) my symptoms got worse. Mainly, I have a hard time staying asleep and when I wake, my whole body will shake with a headache and these weird little muscle facilitations and aches, especially in my arms, chest, and neck. I also have nearly constant tinnitus. 

If I actually stay asleep, the shaking won’t bother me as much. Sometimes I even wake up normally without any thing but the tinnitus. 

Anyway, lately I’ve been wondering if this stuff is happening all the time even during the day and I just don’t notice because I’m busy with my life. A couple of times working out, my body shakes have come so hard that it freaks me out that the gym floor is shaking. If I meditate the tinnitus gets louder and sometimes even makes me dizzy. 

Does this happen to you? Any chance I’m right that this is always happening to my poor tweaked out body lol?

Thanks for reading! If you have any of these symptoms hang in there!"

I've been a lurker on this sub for quite awhile, and I wanted to say something that I think a lot of people might need to hear.

Work is hard, and I know that's not a revelation to anyone here. Every week that I am able to work the full 40 hours is a win, and I don't take that for granted. Not only because it has been a struggle for me in the past, but because I know there are some people out there who just aren't at that point yet with their anxiety. I am lucky enough to have access to medicine and therapy, and I don't take that for granted either. I want everyone out there who works 40 hours a week to give yourselves a pat on the back, but I also want you to be kind to yourself if you can't. You're all valuable people, just by existing every day. Do what you can, and don't let anyone make you feel useless!

194fb4e,Anxiety,2024-01-11,"University, high standards for myself, general feelings of not doing well.","TL;DR: uni work is making me feel anxious and overwhelmed, so I feel sad a lot of the time, and I'm worried of the possible effects it might be having on me 😢

Hello. I have read the rules and I will try to be mindful of those and make my post as concise as possible. I think I mainly just need to get some stuff off my chest in a place where people can understand, do don't worry about having to reassure me :) 
The good thing is that I have started going to therapy regularly in 2023 and have my next appointment really soon.

University has made me feel very stressed and anxious lately, and the worst thing is that I am very much aware of just how stupid my worries are, but no matter how hard I try to remember that, things almost always feel like they're spiraling out of control. I am so worried about the end of the year and some type of work I will have to do then; i have all the time I need to do well, but it feels like such a big project, in a format that i have never approached before, and I am so scared of professors not helping me. I've been feeling like I'm alone and as a result I've gone to bed feeling sad and overwhelmed all the time. I wish i didn't have such high expectations from myself, and that i could take things a bit easier sometimes. I know how capable i am, but it feels so rough when people look at you with so many pairs of eyes. I am scared of letting people down perhaps, and of course I'm scared of not getting any satisfaction out of my work.
I wonder if I'll ever be able to understand that things happen all the time and that a solution exists for any problem, but no matter how hard I try to calm myself down, it always feels like I can't reslly live unless I have constant confirmation of being on the right path... I think I might even have developed some mild form of compulsion/obsession  over this need for confirmation, because I look for signs of that everywhere, to the point where sometimes I genuinely feel paranoid and delusional 😢

This is very heavy, but I needed to get this off my chest in order to feel a bit better. I know i will get through this, but it feels really hard sometimes. Thanks for reading this and giving me any type of feedback."

I just don’t wanna be sent something I don’t wanna see and it’s something they could potentially send me at any time but I don’t know if they will.

It’s nothing serious but it’s very very very anxiety-inducing for me. And no I can’t tell this person not to send it, because I really don’t want it brought up AT ALL. Whenever this certain something is brought up and/or I’m forced to see it, I feel the most anxiety I have ever felt in my life. I struggle with ruminating so I know I’m just gonna make this anxiety attack even worse if I don’t stop it right now.

I know I’m being vague but can someone please help me calm down before I start crying? I have no one to talk to about this."
194f02d,Anxiety,2024-01-11,Feels like a constant battle,"Hey there,

(Sorry if my English isn't perfect, it's not my first language.)

This is my first post here. I'm 31M, I've been dealing with anxiety and mood disorders for a really long time, but since I'm 28, anxiety skyrocketed and I'm really struggling: it feels like a constant battle. 

For the little story Covid hit me like a brick. First, isolation. Despite living with someone, I felt super alone and my depression started to creep. I remember feeling like I needed a big change in my life and particularly on the professional side. In the same time, both of my parents were not in a real good shape: my father was a little bit sick and my mother was fighting a immune disease and multiple heart issues and surgeries for more than ten years. 

End of 2020 and beginning of 2021, they both passed away, together with my grandma and a aunt. All of them in a matter of 3 months. I didn't realize what happened to me. 

In the same time, I had already moved abroad (decision I made with my partner before these events) — not that far from my home country. But I was also struggling a lot with integrating and finding my way into this new life. I quit my job and had a 6 month break, then I started a new job.
My mood was at its lowest point and I started having more anxiety (but still manageable). I also felt more and more tired. 

I noticed my mood and anxiety degraded day after day until December 2022 I started having strong physical symptoms. I thought I was having a heart attack. Of course it was not. Then I started having some breathing problems. I've had some heart tests, a complete set of examinations, and they didn't show anything wrong. But I was not reassured yet. 

My symptoms were messing with me. Fatigue, nausea, tension, cough, headaches of course, pain everywhere, difficulty breathing, jaw clenching, dizziness, tinitus and more. 

I felt unsafe, like there was something wrong with my body. A disease. 
Then comes the body checks, the Googling, the overthinking. 

To fight back, I tried multiple strategies: first, I tried escaping and went on holiday, far away, with friends for 2 weeks. That was horrible. I could stop having anxiety, fear of dying, constant overthinking, I couldn't breathe. I completely wasted these holidays. 
Then, I tried EMDR, focusing on my teenager years, no success. 
I tried journaling, better diet, being more active and going to the gym. 
I read Claire Weekes and Paul David's books, the latest helped me for some weeks.
Then I noticed my anxiety was affecting my back, neck and shoulders, so I tried dry needling, then massage therapies. This got me some relief, but for a really short time.  
Then I decided to hop on a longer therapy with more guidance. This time, it's focusing on Schemas Therapy. It's helping.
But I was still feeling constantly on the edge, nervous. I could burst in tears for anything. I was literally crying every day without knowing why. I had this super heavy chest all the time.

I finally decided to give medication a try. That helped, more this time. It's been now 1 month that I started. But again, this didn't change drastically my mood or improved my physical tension. It just help going through the days with more peace. 

But still... I have this fear. Of diseases. I'm also feeling desperate, and I feel like I'm missing out on my life. I want to live, to experience life to it's fullest and to not be a slave to my anxiety. 

I didn't find the cure yet, maybe there's not. But it's been a really long year now that I'm fighting this beast that eats me day after day. 

Thanks for reading this long story and good luck to everyone!"

Thing is I’m riddled with anxiety. Panic disorder, GAD and health anxiety. Since 2021, I’ve been a complete ball of stress and anxiety. I’ve had a WFH job since it all started, but the contract ended and I needed a new one. This new position I’m starting on Monday will be my first in person job since it all started for me.

I struggle to be alone. Always think something bad will happen, like a heart attack or some random medical issue despite being medically cleared. The past year I’ve gotten better with being home alone, but still struggle to leave the house without someone with me. 

I’m terrified that something will happen either on my walk to work even though it’s just 10 minutes away, or while I’m at work. For reference, I’ll be working in a pharmacy. Rationally I know that if something were to happen, a pharmacy is a good place because there’s medically trained staff there. Also it’s safer to be around people who could call for help rather than home alone. Just don’t know how I’ll get through it - money is tight and I really need this job.

I also think that deep down I know that nothing bad will happen other than at worst a panic attack, but the embarrassment of that happening around new people is terrifying. It’s like I’m experiencing that no escape feeling of the panic already. 

Sorry if any of this doesn’t make sense, I’m very anxious about it so my thoughts are jumbled. Any of your thoughts and advice would be appreciated!! ☺️"

A bunch of my friends have been ill with something, so I'm pretty sure I caught that, but my main worry was that I didn't get a cough or stuffed nose like you usually would with a cold or flu. I can't stop thinking that it's meningitis. It doesn't help that I usually have a stiff neck from a tight trapezius and it feels like there's pressure/resistance when I bend it.

I keep seeing stories on reddit about how young people went to sleep thinking they just had the flu and it ended up being bacterial meningitis and they died. I can't go see a doctor either just in case right now because my parents are the type to say sleep it off and see how you feel, and we've been to A&amp;E twice in the past 2 months or so.

194dti8,Anxiety,2024-01-11,Stomach Worries,"Hello, lately I've (28M) been feeling this strange sensation in my stomach for the past two days. I've had this physical sensation of feeling hungry all the time but I've been eating just fine, for the past few months I've been eating healthier and more fiber and more veggies and less fats and sugars and it's been working out but now I'm not sure what's happened. Maybe I haven't been eating enough protein because I have definitely cut down on that too from before my diet. 

I just don't feel satisfied while eating or after eating. But I normally get full after a meal and eat slower and slower as I'm finishing up and then I know when I don't want anymore. So it's weird to physically feel that rumble in my stomach like I haven't eaten in hours. I don't feel super full like I normally even if I try to. 

Four days ago, before this sensation started, I was eating some spicy stuff and it was making me feeling a little hurt in my stomach especially three days ago, I was feeling a bit of a sting/cramp in my upper abdominal area. The next day, not long after my usual breakfast, I started feeling this hunger sensation. Today I woke up with this sort of muscle spasm feeling on my right side that would come up every so often for a few seconds but as of wiriting this, I haven't gotten it since the morning.

I'm worried this could be like a parasite or something but I'm not really experiencing anything crazy apart from this. No diarrhea or vomiting or nausea or exhaustion or anything. Most I have is a lot of burping and acid reflux which I've been prone to all my life. Granted I have been pretty stressed about a handful of stuff here and there so I'm also aware it can be that. And this feeling doesn't help since I've always been a bit of a hypochondriac. Anything would help thank you!"

TW: mention of cancer 

Female 23 years old

It al started for me in december 2022. I suddenly experiencing pain in my left eye. I thought it was just a normal eye infection because i wear contact lenses. After a couple of days that eye started buldging a bit and my pupil was wider then my right so i panicked. I went to th ER and they also noticed that my pupil was a bit bigger then the other so they send me to the eye department. The eye doctor checked my eye and said nothing was wrong, just dry eyes and that the pupil isn’t that much wider than the other and told me to use eye drops. It didn’t get better after a few days and this is where the googling started. I kept seeing the worst case scenario’s and panicked so i wanted a second opinion. That doctor also said it was dry eyes. Then i went to a third doctor (all in a matter of two weeks since symptoms started). The third doctor basically said the same as the other two and did a more detailed exam. She said my contacts were the culprit. Because i was wearing them for so long without rest it put a bit of trauma to the eye. After weeks of using the eye drops it got better. And this was the beginning of my hypochondria and health anxiety. All of a sudden i developed extreme chest pain and headaches. To the point i was crying. I got so scared so i got a ct of my brain and of my chest and everything was normal. After a week my back was also in excrutiating pain and kept googling my symptoms, so i got a ct of my spine as well and this was normal too. This is when doctors told me i was dealing with anxiety. As soon as i took those cr scans my symptoms disappeared. 


But then in february i started getting issues with my digestive system which didn’t disappear. I’M STILL DEALING WITH TODAY ALMOST A YEAR LATER! I started getting upper abdominal pain, my throat closed up, i have the constant feeling like i don’t have enough space in my throat, my stomach became bloated. I had these symptoms 24/7. I got scared after 2 weeks so i went to a GI doctor. He did an ultrasound and said i had a lot of air in my stomach and this is because of anxiety and basically not breathing in the right way. Another few weeks passed by and i went back because i still had my symptoms and i kept googling my symptoms and stomach cancer kept appearing so i asked for an endoscopy. This came back normal. After this i kept going to the ER bc of my stomach issues and i had chest pain again. The ER doctor took my blood and everything came back normal and he said he wanted to take my blood from the vein in my wrist bc he said “i see your not breathing in the right way”. That bloodtest showed i was chronically hyperventilating. So i kind of let it go and started going to a therapist. In april my stomach pain finally disappeared but the other symptoms still persisted. My uncle got diagnosed with stage 4 cancer in january and it became stage 4 because he didn’t go to the doctor. So this made me spiral and i just kept thinking i had some type of cancer because my symptoms just didn’t disappear. I thought i thyroid cancer so i did an ultrasound on my neck (because my tyroid levels were a bit off). In june i kept thinking i had ovarian cancer because i didn’t had my period for months and i still had the bloated stomach so i went to a gynaecologist (3 different ones) i had an mri of my pelvis and in july a ct of my whole abdomen. Everything came back normal. The only thing that they noticed was the bloated stomach with air that was still present. After that ct scan i accepted it that i was dealing with anxiety and chronic stress. That summer i stopped stressing about it and just enjoyed my summer and holiday back home. When came back i had my retakes and this is where i suddenly developed a sudden change in my stool. Everyday i would get hard stool. Sometimes like pebbles and sometimes long and thin. I didn’t panic straight away because i just accepted it as anxiety and till november i didn’t go to the doctors anymore until i got an ear infection and a few weeks after that i got an eye infection and that triggered it again and had again chest pains, back pains and other pains that made me go to the doctor again and the googling and hypochondria came back.

My hard stool that i have everyday when i go to the bathroom still hasn’t disappeared and the bloated stomach and narrow throat is also still present. I’m gonna go to my therapist again because i didn’t go for months because everything was booked. My mind still goes sometimes to colon cancer bc of my symptoms and i keep wondering if i should get an colonoscopy or not. 

Does anyone on here also deal with chronic stress and chronic GI issues and can you give me some advice or tips on how to handle this? 

I hope that 2024 will be better for me mentally and physically."

194dekx,Anxiety,2024-01-11,Worried that I have a temporal lobe tumour,"I had a CT scan a few months back, but in recent months, I find myself saying words in a pronunciation i didn't quite intend, find myself stumbling over words more, sometimes saying a simile instead of the actual word, as well as getting sore eyes, and waking up constantly in the middle of the night every night. Is this anxiety too?  
  
Currently have  
  
\- stomach pains (started in August, convinced for a while I was going to have a heart attack)  
  
\- recurring leg pain  
  
\- headaches (especially pulsating feeling, throbbing, in neck and head, started really in September, but i've always had headaches, but never throbbing migraines)  
  
\- neck tension (neck bone stiffens up regularly and sticks out a bit, in September)  
  
\- tinnitus noise in centre of head (like farting in head, in late September)  
  
\- burning eyes  
  
\- burning mouth syndrome (once very briefly)  
  
\- sour throat for a month and a half  
  
\- globus pharyngeus (developed after the sore throat)  
  
\- itchy eyes, recurring red eyes  
  
\- Phantosmia - imagining a petrolly smell.  
  
My eye keeps twitching, my chin too, to a lesser extent. Both my eyes are sore.  
  
Sometimes, my lip quivers.  
  
A crackling/farting noise is regularly in my head.  
  
I have pains in both legs.  
  
I go to sleep at 9.30-ish, and regularly wake up between 11 and 1 ish AM.  
  
A recurring high temperature every so often that then vanishes  
  
  
  
  
  
I've had seven or so (CBC) blood tests, myriad trips to the Doctor, a CT scan, but after a woman I was talking to disappeared when I left the door open for her and one other similar thing where someone I know vaguely seemingly disappeared from my view, I am convinced I AM having hallucinations and am worried. My mother died in January, so that's probably what the anxiety is caused.  
  
But I am finding it harder to concentrate. My head feels jumbled. I can't think as smoothly. I sometimes feel I am talking slurred, even though people don't think I am. My doctor (and other doctors) keep telling me there's nothing to worry about, and that the medication will take another two months (I've been on lexapro since November) to kick in.  
  
The more symptoms I'm getting, the longer it goes on.  
  
Are any of these symptoms not symptomatic of a lobe tumour?"
194deep,Anxiety,2024-01-11,fuck,My heart is beating badly again I don’t know why it’s not fucking fair. Thanks to God who I ask for help he just laughs instead and just wants to see me beg to him. This is not fucking fair

194co2v,Anxiety,2024-01-11,Is Klonopin ever going to work for me?,"Hi! I'm a 17-year-old female who just starting taking Klonopin for my bad anxiety and nightmares from trauma. I've read some of the side affects, but will they ever go away? A lot of people I've read on here seem to say that it makes them feel normal again and lessens their anxiety. Ever since I started taking the Klonopin, I've been crying every single day for absolutely no reason at all. The other day, I sobbed for over an hour straight. Yesterday I started crying for half an hour because I didn't understand a math problem. Today I cried in history class for no reason and now I'm doing it again. It also makes me even more anxious and it feels like I can barely breathe at certain points. I'll get irritable very easily, but when I take it at night, I feel fine. I'm still having my nightmares. I haven't felt much happiness at all. If I'm not upset or irritated, I just feel numb. Is it going to get better or is this not for me? I mean, I have only had it for a little bit of time. Is it going to take long for me to feel better? My parents are saying it hasn't been long at all and it has barely even started to work. Is this good for me or not?"
194cj51,Anxiety,2024-01-11,Is thinking people are trying to poison you anxiety ?,I also have this strange thing where I think and believe my dad kills himself and have to build up courage to go check on him for no reason.

194cgi8,Anxiety,2024-01-11,Anxiety or serious illness?,"Hello, this is my first post here, but sometimes I feel like I can't anymore. I'm a boy, I'm 24 years old, my childhood was extraordinary, without trauma, absolutely nothing, and now I live a very good life, a stable job, a wife I get along with, I was also expecting a baby, but it's on the way :

It all started 6-7 months ago, when I got up from the table and got a little dizzy, something that has happened before, by the way. I go to the toilet, I come back when suddenly the pain starts, a strong feeling of fainting (but I didn't faint), tachycardia, palpitations, blood pressure 17/11. I was with my parents, I call the ambulance, it comes, we go to the emergency room where they did tests, in the meantime the ""crisis"" disappeared before I got to the cardiologist. They did a brain CT scan, usual analyses, cardio control, everything seems to be fine. In the following weeks (1-2), this happened 4 more times in different poses, again visits to the emergency room, etc. Since then, an extraordinary panic has been activated and at the first symptom I think I'm ""having a heart attack, stroke"" or I have a disease that no one knows about yet. In these 6-7 months, I have had private check-ups, from the simplest (usual tests done at 4 medical units) to the most complex (cerebral angiography, coronary angiography with contrast material), I have been to at least 2-3 doctors on every specialty except cardio and neuro, where I went to 11 doctors respectively 5. I did tests over tests, endocrine, internal medicine, cardiology, psychologist, psychiatry, ENT, ophthalmologist, pulmonologist, HIV tests, hepatitis, coagulation factors, tests stress test, holter test, adrenal gland analysis, carotid doppler echo, electroencephalogram, sleep apnea test, vestibular test and many others, all, but absolutely all with very good results, no changes, but inside I feel that something is wrong the irregularity. I haven't been ME for 6-7 months, it's like I can't see well anymore, I'm often dizzy but it's a strange dizziness, I don't spin and the camera doesn't spin but my legs seem to go numb, I don't sleep properly, I forget things, I feel sleepy and I am constantly tired, frequent palpitations, as if I can barely keep my eyes open, sensitive to light. I feel like I'm going crazy, I don't know what else to do to be well. I tried treatments from simple vitamins to many others. I don't know what to do anymore, if you have any advice, please give it to me."
194c5vo,Anxiety,2024-01-11,Is it wrong for me to miss my anxiety?,"I’ve been taking my anxiety meds for quite a while, but I’ve still had my depressed side. I’ve struggled with anxiety for basically my whole life. But now that I take my meds I’m still anxious it feels like I have my usual panic attacks but I don’t know what I’m scared about. I almost miss how my anxiety gave a bit of certainty with it."
194c5r7,Anxiety,2024-01-11,Symptoms,"Does anyone get a whistle when breathing out when VERY anxious or almost a lisp? 


When I'm really anxious and start noticing it and the focus on it I get a whistle when exhaling and sometimes when talking get a lisp with certain sounds.    

Of course I get the lump in throat constantly 🙄....."
194bx4e,Anxiety,2024-01-11,Do I have anxiety disorder?,"Hello everyone, I hope everyone who's experiencing anxiety issues gets well soon. A couple of months ago or perhaps a year ago I started feeling like I've something around my neck over the days it got worse and then every time I tried to go to sleep I felt like I was being strangled i practiced breathing techniques and calmed my mind and went to sleep and thought nothing of it, it went away for a while, until now...
It's been a week already, it first started only when I go to sleep but now even in my day i experience feeling like I'm falling off a building, sometimes i imagine myself jumping off a building and it feels real, sometimes I feel like my heart is shaking and my legs week after experiencing it for some time.

Any advice or sharing similar experiences is much appreciated. I don't know what's happening or what to even call it, I've never experienced anything like this before."
194bhzq,Anxiety,2024-01-11,I’m going insane (hypochondriac),My son is 4 and noticed in the afternoon as I was changing his clothes he hide bites on his left shoulder going down his arm and to his chest and freaked out. I thought could it be fleas but no because of the location. I live in a back house and my in laws are in front and they have a dog I suspect has fleas cause he has before in summer and they never treated him.  He like to spend most of his day outside he comes by my door I pet him he occasionally runs inside my house I either carry him out our lure him out with food. But I  messed up right when I googled flea bites or type of bug bites and saw bed bugs bites and looked like his bites I immediately started searching my sons mattress and  my mattress and bed  frames ripped open the box spring checked my couch on the floor behind the bed frames and wall by our beds and nothing thankfully but still hasn’t put my mind at ease my mind keeps fixating it’s bed bugs cause google says they can hide very good and maybe I just missed them I need an answer to calm down and I don’t know if I’m going to get one.
194bcyn,Anxiety,2024-01-11,Social anxiety,"So I have this condition where if someone is talking directly to me then I get anxious and can not maintain eye contact moreover, while this conversation if I am smiling or laughing then my face starts to twitch(specifically cheeks). This twitching occurs only during the conversations so I think its related to my social anxiety. Also, whenever I talk with any person who has a high social status or has a great personality, I start to shake and stutter. What are your thoughts on this? Does anyone else face similar situations? And any advice on how to resolve this?

194ax1o,Anxiety,2024-01-11,My dog had recent surgery and is feeling sick today.,"I am worried out of my mind right now even though I know she has a vet appointment this afternoon. She just had a knee surgery to repair a torn ligament and had been recovering well. I’ve been told that she is probably feeling nauseous from the meds, but I keep worrying to the point of making MYSELF nauseous. 

I objectively know worrying so much about it isn’t going to help in the meantime, and I’m starting to feel frustrated with my anxiety. 

Here’s to hoping my sweet Junebug feels better soon and the vet can figure out what’s up. 

In the meantime any tips to help distract me from this setback would be helpful. I’ve been watching TV and reading."
194auht,Anxiety,2024-01-11,Anxiety on week offs/day offs,How do I get rid of feeling anxious when I get day off from work or I'm on leave. The only time I don't feel anxious is when I'm working and i don't have anything important coming my way in near future. Today I'm feeling even more anxiety than usual week off day ever since i applied for higher level post in my company. Don't know what to do it's 1.30 pm here and i can't sleep. Even if I'm not thinking about any of it still have this uneasy feeling bothering me.
194ang2,Anxiety,2024-01-11,Magnesium Glycinate Suppliments,"So I started taking magnesium glycinate to help with anxiety because i was doing research and a lot of people swear by it to help with anxiety. A lot of people have positive effects from it but the first time i took it i had a bad panic attack about an hour or 2 later and i had to take a warm shower and just sit in the tub for like 20 mins. I don’t know if this was just my mind tricking me or what was happening. But i have heard that a lot of anti-anxiety and anti-depressants have magnesium in them and when you first start taking those kinds of medicines you’ll have panic attacks for a couple of days and then be fine and they’ll help.

Do you think i should just push through and continue taking them or stop taking them completely and try actual anxiety medicine?"
194afm7,Anxiety,2024-01-11,"Hi, is it ok to take different manufactured made generic Zoloft / Sertraline?","I've been taking 50mg made by Cipla the past two months and it doesnt do anything. Actually, maybe it's making my mental condition abit worse. 

My Doc put me on 100mg recently but I mesed up and it was sent to a different Pharmacy
 The meds there was manufactured by Granules.

I already picked up the Granules Sertraline so at this point so I might take a few 50 tablets, see how it is, then go to 100. Idk Should I even bother staying with cipla made sertraline or should I try the granules made sertraline? I'm pretty clueless about all of this stuff."
194aevb,Anxiety,2024-01-11,Anxiety about the world and stuff,"
Yea, I’ve been seeing a lot of sorta doomer type stuff, about there being solar storms that could disrupt the entire internet, and that the government is going screw us over, and AI is gonna take over the word, and we won’t get any money and stuff, and how climate change is going to become a massive problem, and how Covid is in wastewater, so like I need reassurance that everything’s going to be alright"
194a3nc,Anxiety,2024-01-11,The thought of therapy scares me,"Being alone in a room I can’t escape from (I could theoretically, but everyone would just ask more questions) with an adult that wants to know everything about me, and constantly asks questions, just scares me. 

But I can’t get help with that, or anything else when I don’t actually go to therapy. 

So I just think about going to therapy one day, but never take any step to get closer to that."
1949qtd,Anxiety,2024-01-11,What helps you sleep?,"What helps you sleep? It can be a homemade drink, a drink from the store, habbits, sleeping position, anything. 

I'll be starting work soon, and I don't want to struggle with sleep due to overthinking. My sleeping pattern is really bad, and I dislike it. There are times when my brain just wants to think about so many things, keeping me awake for the next 30 minutes even with my eyes closed. I hate that; it makes me feel like I'm about to go nuts. Whenever I have something to do the next morning, I tend to overthink and end up not getting enough sleep.

I want to avoid this on my first day at work and in the following days. Usually, having a cartoon playing in the background with the lights off helps me sleep, but the results are inconsistent. I'm looking for a more permanent solution to consistently sleep early, wake up early, and have energy. Can you help me out?

TL;DR: I have trouble having sleep, suggest your ways."
1949lg9,Anxiety,2024-01-11,"Thick air sensation, shortness of breath and chest tightness","Hello everyone.

After 7 years with anxiety and coming close to a complete cure, I would like to ask a question. 

I have managed to completely eradicate almost all the symptoms (palpitations, tiredness, muscle tension, panic attacks and many more) but there is a physical symptom that does not disappear (sometimes I notice it more and sometimes less). My chest feels heavy, to take air through my nose I have to use more force, as if the air were denser or heavier, together with a slight difficulty in breathing. I don't take any medication (at the time I tried Escitalopram, on the second day I had adverse effects such as altered vision and dilated pupils).

It makes me very angry that I don't have other symptoms and only have this one, but it just won't go away. I would like to know if anyone has had the same thing happen to them and if you have any advice to give me such as any effective medication for it or any remedy. 

I wouldn't like to take medication considering that I have practically no more symptoms, but I could try very low doses, I don't know if in the state I'm in it's better to take medication or continue as I am (I'm already half used to it).

I look forward to your help, thank you very much."

1949i8t,Anxiety,2024-01-11,How do people with anxiety present/perform at school/work ?,"I (25F) am an Interior Design student in NY. Im going back in about a week and I'm kind of dreading it. I love the work, even when it's a bit much it feels but better than not having anything to do. The problem is I have so much trouble presenting my work. I have to do it every week, for each class and my voice breaks so much, I start sweating and shaking. I burst into tears during my midterm presentation last semester and after that I had to be given Ativan from my psychiatrist. I lost my psychiatrist recently and I have an appointment set up for a new one but I worried that she won't be comfortable prescribing me benzos after just 1 session. the 1st week of school is always the worst for me, even if I'm not presenting. I'm wondering how everyone else with anxiety gets through these kind of moments. When you have to stay as professional as possible but your physical anxiety symptoms are coming out. I know not everyone takes benzos too, I don't want to rely on them but anti-anxieties/depressants don't work on me. I know I'm not alone, but I never hear people talk about how consuming the physical symptoms of anxiety can be. If I want to do well in my career as a designer, I have to look confident in my ideas.

I was so happy to finally be on the up and up. Stopping the prednisone made me feel worse. I feel like a crazy person!!! How long do these effects last? I took prednisone for 5 days, 40mg daily.

1949ceg,Anxiety,2024-01-11,Back at it again with sever medical anxiety,"Long story short since the beginning of November I made a massive change in my life for a career that will absolutely change my trajectory. In order to do this I had to quite my old job, do tons of paperwork and suffer financially for a little bit. Starting Jan 15th it will all begin and I’ll be stable again. But in between these time frames I have had a severe since of dissociation with myself I feel like I’m questioning my decision from every facet of life I feel like I’m either not doing what I should be or I’m doing things I didn’t plan on doing I’m just wandering. This has fed a lot of anxiety from personality changes do to cancer or early onset dementia. The hyper reflection of my own mind has lead me to persistent thoughts that I’m not myself or that something is wrong in my brain. When my friends come over I feel like I’m treating them differently or I’m saying things I don’t normally say. Other than that I feel fine. I’m not sick or forgetful or lethargic more than normal. I e been off work for about three weeks and I’m that time my sleep schedule has fallen apart and I’ve played way to many video games in between paperwork and the stress of preparation for the 15th. 

I suppose I just need reassurance that I’m not insane or mentally deteriorating. Sorry for that rant I appreciate you all."

i took the PiCAT route then took my verification yesterday at a community college. (82🥳🥳🥳) its a two hour drive. an hour in i was relaxed, having fun with my sister. then my stomach just turns. anxiety hit me like a brick, granted, i have a history of it, but this was weird. i LOVE taking tests, but they have given me anxiety before. in this case, i was more than happy to be there and take it. and then me and my sister were going to visit the city and drive around. i was so happy until that one hour in. i was still excited when i thought about it, but my symptoms were coming in big waves. 

has anyone ever experienced this??? i was literally so happy to join and so so excited for everything, even the real $hitty, or hard parts lol. now it’s the day after i feel sluggish and anxious. i’m going to post this in the Air Force forum as well. maybe it’s normal in the process.

please note i used to have really bad anxiety, but haven’t had an occurrence like this in a very long time. this feeling was probably felt in highschool, i’m three years graduated. i am also off lexapro (low dose) for 4 months now and everyday has been great so far. 

what on earth happened to me there??

Edit: Here are some things that definitely didn’t help my case. I didn’t sleep the night before so it led to 21 hours of no sleep to 32 by the time I got home. I drank about 8 shots of expresso on an empty stomach on the way there. I also took my BC on an empty stomach. Previous test anxiety, last affected me in fourth grade.

Edit: bad anxiety, not baby!!"
1948xt7,Anxiety,2024-01-11,Hyper-aware of every bodily sensation and trying too hard to control movements,"It's driving me crazy. When I reflect on my lifelong struggles with anxiety/ADHD/OCD, I realize I can't recall a time in my life when I was not uncomfortably aware of everything my body does and feels. I'm talking mostly about the things I can control: jaw, shoulders, limbs, extremities, face, etc.

Example: My posture has been bad for years. I've been working on it for most of last year going into this year, and I still catch myself trying to force everything to be in the right placement. My jaw clenches, so I press my tongue against the roof of my mouth and hold my jaw in the ""healthy"" position. I notice I point my feet slightly outwards and that my knees feel better when I force my feet to point forward. The result is awkward and looks and feels unnatural. The result is always the same: my body goes back to doing the thing I don't want it to do, I am SO aware of it and how uncomfortable it is, and the whole thing repeats.

Does anyone else experience this? What information do you have about it? I'm seeing my doctor this month, and I want to go in with some knowledge of what is going on there or even some language to communicate more clearly. I know my Strattera is a likely culprit for the jaw things, so I already plan to bring this up.

It's been dominating my life and making it so I can't enjoy many things because I've become so hyper-focused on all the aches, pains, and everything else going on in my crappy body. Any information would be very helpful."
1948xdt,Anxiety,2024-01-11,I’m ashamed of how mean I was in not taking a simple photo for a lovely group of older female tourists,"I was on my way into the library, which in the city I live in is very architectural beautiful and many people come here just to admire it. Well, on my way inside three ladies, one of whom had physical disabilities, asked me if I wouldn’t mind taking their picture and I pointed to someone else and asked them if he would possibly be willing to do it instead. They were so obviously disappointed and I heard one lady telling you the one that “it’s ok”. I instantly felt like such a tool, and I thought about going back and telling them id love to take their picture but I was embarrassed. By way of an explanation- though I’m aware it’s not an excuse - the last few years have really been tumultuous for me and I’ve become pretty shut down and wary of basically everyone. I’m trying to get over it but it’s difficult.   I hope to one day, once again be the kind of person who would feel more than happy to oblige that kind of request.   Just looking for thoughts on how horrible this makes me?"
1948v6t,Anxiety,2024-01-11,Deja Vu Anxiety Symptom?,"Hi Reddit. I am a 21 year old male in my fourth year of college. I have been especially stressed out over the last few months because I have been applying to law schools and taking the LSAT etc. all while managing a job at a law firm that demands a high amount of responsibility. This entire motley of responsibilities has triggered my anxiety to go through the roof. 

A bit of background, I feel as if I have always had some sort of anxiety because I tend to bite my nails often, feel shortness of breath, and get overly anxious/nervous for the smallest things. I have never really had any other anxiety symptoms for the rest of my life. Health anxiety is also my biggest anxiety because a panic attack in July 2022 sent me to the ER and I passed out when drawing blood lol, and since then I have not felt the same. Hospital said absolutely everything about me was perfect and healthy. I then began to develop stronger anxiety symptoms like palpitations and hypervigilance over my own health and any little thing I feel in my body would set me off. Symptoms would come and go over time and some would be persistent like a tightness in my chest. After all the physical symptoms were checked out by a doctor and everything came out perfectly fine, my anxiety told me ""you have something wrong mentally"", and that is what completely sent me swirling because I started to panic and freak out thinking that I am losing my mind, or developing some major mental health disorder. These fears subsided with professional help.

Since June of 2023, I felt an even bigger uptick in my anxieties because of the big responsibilities that I have had to deal with (work, school, law school), to the point where it started causing some episodes of deja vu. Another cause of the anxiety was that I came to the realization of how stuck in my head I am and how much I struggle to be present in the moment and not constantly thinking at a million miles per hour. The more I tried to be out of my head and in the moment, the more stuck in my thoughts and head I became. At the start, the deja vu was accompanied by a dropping sensation in my stomach (like when you receive bad news) and panic. I got checked by a neurologist for epilepsy/brain tumor and every test came back negative and they said my brain was perfectly healthy. Since then I developed a fear that I was developing schizo, but after learning about it, I realized that there is no chance I have it since it does not run in my family and I do not use drugs (I have never even tried it). I also went to an expert and they guaranteed that what I have is just anxiety/GAD. They mainly helped with getting through the fear of schizo and ""losing my mind"" but I stopped sessions because it became too expensive. 

Now, the deja vus are no longer accompanied by panic but they kind of just happen, and I really really want them to stop. It makes me feel so disconnected from the world and has even caused DPDR. They happen a few times a week and it has not stopped since summer of 2023. I have been able to tie these deja vus to lack of sleep and stress (they happen mostly at work/school). I also get episodes where I have a deja vu about my train of thought and I can sort of predict my train of thought like WTF is that lol. Sometimes the deja vu will happen when I see/hear something that is very closely related to something I have actually heard/seen in the past. Also, it feels like my subconscious has just been programmed to be on fight or flight / hyperaware of potential deja vu scenarios and that in it of itself can trigger an episode of deja vu. 

I am at the ends of my wits with this and I am looking for advice to see what I can do to stop these episodes, get out of my own head, and be myself again like how once was back in my childhood/teenage years. I do not have depression or anything and I love life and am happy with my family and friends around me, but man this feels like a constant grey cloud over my head and I want it to go away and be free. Also looking to see if anyone else gets deja vu as a symptom of their anxiety. Any advice would be amazing and greatly appreciated. Love you all!

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: Does anyone else get deja vu as a symptom of anxiety? Do they go away with time? How can I stop them? I have been checked by neurologist to rule out epilepsy and every test conducted indicated that my brain is perfectly healthy."
1948usw,Anxiety,2024-01-11,Sorry but I gotta just let it out,"Hello all. I really hate to feel like I’m “crying” on the internet. But, I just got something to get off my chest. 

Lately it’s been a rough go. Seems like the days have just been a drag. I contribute most of my feelings towards this shit ass weather and the lull of this specific time of year. It takes every ounce of my being to get through these days. I work while feeling like I’m about to kill over from a heart related incident. However today hasn’t been too bad. I had a good lunch and the sun has been shining for the first time in about two weeks at my location. But I still can’t shake that feeling in my chest. Like a weight that just magically appears and lasts for a while, until it’s just gone. The subsiding feeling is usually only eliminated through intense focus on my trade or by a really intriguing podcast, only to return at the end of the day when I’m getting in the truck to go home. I’m sick of going home, but my 6 month old son and my wife need me tremendously, but I just want solitude, even though it’s probably not exactly what I need. Somehow I still manage to tell myself “just one more hour”, “you can go to sleep soon” “the weekend is almost here” just to get through another episode. The SSRI’s are obsolete as they just turn me into a zombie and leave me  not functioning at me required capacity. Oh well. The cycle “just get through this hour” keeps me strong, and somewhat level headed enough to be a good employee and father, and husband. 

For what it’s worth, if no one has told you today. You can and will get through this. Even if it’s a little harder some days than others you will get through it. We have to. Cheers to all."

I literally feel like I'm being paid to be anxious, to assume the worst case scenario so I can keep the company finances in check.

I've got an interview next week for a minimum wage job in an area I enjoy that is completely different and gets me out of my head. But obviously being an accountant I constantly worry and stress about figures, so I'm terrified of making the wrong decision and just feeling like another failure and loosing everything I've worked for (house, pets, partner).

For me, its dizziness; my brain telling me that I cant focus and things moving around me. Its so bad because I have acid reflux and gastric problems. Its like I am in a loop of overthinking between my body gas being the reason to my heavy head or my anxiety being the reason for so much acid in my body.

Theres times when I get off my phone and suddenly my brain gets so foggy that I cant even focus on what people are saying to me or what am I supposed to do. It takes time to calm myself down or I need a distraction that draws my attention away for atleast an hour.

Backstory; I have been living on my own for years but I feel that I have been watching my phone’s screen for atleast 3 hours before sleeping in a dark room. Sometimes it goes to about 6 hours. It is so much better now but I keep falling back in the trap. I get heart palpitations very often now. I dont want to go on medication and never had any before.

Please tell me this is all just overthinking and health anxiety. I dont have any financial crisis but I have been living like this for 9 months and its just getting worse. Theres so much information that I have from google now and I try linking it everytime. Tinnitus been there for 3 months as well. I get brain fogs so often + cannot focus when I talk.

How can I get better? Especially the brain fog and the dizziness.

1946ua4,Anxiety,2024-01-11,"Heart palps, with no anxiety","So I’ve been having these palps since like November, skipped beats, fluttering, etc. y’all know what I’m talking about.

They’ve been decreasing as of lately, because I’ve been controlling my anxiety better, but sometimes I just get them out of the blue, even when I’m not feeling anxious, so here’s my question. 

Is it a thing where you can just get palps from just “thinking” about them?? 

Like earlier today I was sitting in my room and I was thinking “wow I don’t even feel anxious right now I’m doing great”, and researching about cardio health. 

Then when I got up to leave I felt a palp and my heart trying to catch up. 

I’m so confused, I didn’t even feel anxious, should I be worried about this? 

I’ve already visited a doctor and cardiologist, 3 day holter monitor showed less than one percent of my normal heart beats had an extra one in front.

I’m so confused, waiting on second holter monitor results as I type this, just wanted to know if anyone else experiences this. 

I’ve also been wanting to get back into smoking weed a bit, VERY RARELY AND MINIMAL HITS, just with a friend. Not sure if it’s a good idea though, been going back and forth."

I hv been to the ER so maby times and got all the tests done which came back normal. Im also obese so i fear that might worsen my health.

I hv become hyperaware of my heartbeats. I keep googling stuff and thinking i have it. Even my dreams are filled with anxiety nowadays. All the doctors have grown tired explaining there is nothing wrong with me. I just keep thinking about all the tests that they have not done and how those could diagnose smthing. I have been diagnosed with severe OCD too which makes me google symptoms. Therapy helped for a while but now im back to spiralling out of control.

Im so sorry for such a long rant but i am really tired of it now. I keep getting suicidal ideations thinking I would rather die with my own will than die by some illness. Kindly help."
1946hjp,Anxiety,2024-01-11,How to relieve globus sensation caused by anxiety?,"I'm experiencing that sensation that makes your throat feel tight, uncomfortable or like there's a lump / a band of pressure pressing inwards. It's affecting my breathing (can only breathe long and slow) and my day-to-day. It get's progressively worse through the day (as I get more tired I believe).

I'm aware I'm not actively suffocating or choking, but the constant pressure is severely affecting my focus, sleep and my appetite - it's been 3 weeks and it hasn't gone away once. Been to the GP and UTC and all my physicals come back fine, no medication (I can't swallow tablets) but seeing a therapist in 10 days. It's becoming unbearable.

My anxiety tends to be more physical than emotional/mental but it has never presented like this before and I'm really struggling to find some helpful advice.

I've tried:

* Heartburn/acid reflux medication: **doesn't help**
* Gargling saline/salt water: **doesn't help**
* Breathing exercises &amp; guided meditation: **very rarely helps**
* Sipping water, yawning, swallowing instead of clearing my throat etc: **very rarely helps**
* Rolling my neck and shoulders: **sometimes helps to alleviate it for a short period**

Not sure what initially triggered it, I'm as calm as I can be mentally and physically now - all my other symptoms of anxiety have gone away except for this. I'm fairly certain it's causing itself so I try not to dwell on it but it does impact my concentration and general comfort regardless.

Is there anything you do that helps alleviate it or make it go away? Or anything you find helps you to cope better through it, maybe specific stretches or routines? Or is this just a sensation I'm going to have to ride out?

Thank you,"

1944dcs,Anxiety,2024-01-11,Why do I get so anxious and upset when people won’t stop talking/chatting at work?,"I want to preface that I do suffer from anxiety and take medication for it. The past few years I feel like my anxiety has been very mild and regulated to the point where I’m not as anxious as I used to be. 

In high school I suffered from severe social anxiety to the point where I would go into fight or flight mode and pass out. If I had to stand up in front of the class or do a presentation, I would either pass out of feel like I was going to. I have not felt or encountered this since I graduated high school in 2019.  

I currently work in an office with several different girls. I am always busy and have a pretty high and somewhat stressful workload. These girls will talk for long periods of time with their computers off. One of them is my supervisor. I have to work with my earbuds in 24/7 to try to block them out but sometimes that doesn’t always work to tune them out. 

It makes me very anxious and upset. I’m very non confrontational. Sometimes I will sit in the bathroom or walk around until they stop talking because I can’t focus or stop hyper focusing on their chatter. I know this an overreaction but I don’t know what to do :/ 

I wish I could say “please stop talking” but that’s just not something I would do or could do since one of them is my supervisor and I don’t want to create any drama or negativity in the work place."

Funny part is whenever I go to my dentist even if just for a consultation and no work my heart races,I feel like I'm going to pass out and get all flush along with pretty dramatic bp rise.

So my dentist wanted $500 for the retainer. My wife is an orthodontist assistant and her orthodontist said he would make one for me for free. So I go in this morning and get scanned for it as well as a pan xray so he could give his opinion as to what route I should take with my bad teeth....I didn't have 1 single symptom of ANY anxiety at ALL!

I sometimes feel like my heart has a singular hard beat and then I feel like it’s racing. This has sent me to the ER twice in the last month because I’m terrified something is seriously wrong with my heart. Both times they did chest X-ray and blood work and even a chest CT once and everything checked out but I can’t stop from worrying that it’s more?? I went to cardiologist yesterday and they offered (didn’t make it sound necessary just an offer) to put me on beta blockers but I’m scared to be on heart medication at 24 if I don’t need to be. And I feel like no one is giving me a clear answer if it’s anxiety or could be something more. This has honestly ruined my life. All I think about 24/7 is my mortality and if I’m okay and worrying that my high heart rate will cause something to happen to me before anyone finds something wrong. I started Wellbutrin a couple weeks ago and haven’t noticed much difference anxiety wise but I hope it starts to settle in my system and I notice a difference in the next week or two. I also started buspar but I woke up one morning feeling really weak and kind of detached so I stopped taking that and am anxious to try again in case that were to happen again.

Every other time this has happened it has sent me into a full blown panic attack but today I was able to keep my cool (without my meds!!!) And fix the problem!

The first time it happened today I waited it out and got lucky because it only froze up for like 5 mins but the second one it was frozen for over an hour again. Normally this event would have caused regression because my phone is my only lifeline but instead today it caused progress! I hope anyone who is struggling has breakthrough like this very soon!

But ever since I started therapy 2 years ago, I was able to go out more and see my old friends again that I haven't seen for some time due to my anxiety issues. I've been in regular contact with them ever since I finished therapy about 1 1/2 years ago (I went to therapy for 6 months) and we usually go out together every weekend, sometimes even during the week. But lately I've been noticing that most of them are just there to have a drink and a laugh, and I wouldn't really get to see them if it weren't for alcohol. There's also been some other incidents that got me thinking that maybe these aren't good friends for me, but I'm not going to go deeper into that now.

I haven't met any of my friends for about 2 weeks now, and I'm starting to notice how my anxiety is making daily comebacks again (I haven't had daily anxiety attacks ever since I finished therapy), so now I'm wondering - is having fake friends better for your mental health than having no friends at all? After all they did (unintentionally) help me overcome my social anxiety, and I guess that accounts for something..

What are your thoughts about this?"
1942yzl,Anxiety,2024-01-11,Does anyone else feel like they are losing their minds or going to die?,"Hi everyone 

I’m 17, and I’ve been struggling with anxiety a lot, more recently. I’ve been trying to work towards healing, especially since I have a lot of physical symptoms. I’ve started therapy and it has helped a bit. But I’ve been having a hard time the past few days.

I keep feeling like I’m going to lose my mind or like I’m going to die or something. But the negative thoughts get so bad and I have such bad head pressure that it makes me feel crazy. I also have derealization so it makes me not feel real too, and everything piles up.

 I’m scared, because I don’t want to lose my mind. I don’t want to go to a hospital. I’m scared, and I’m freaking exhausted. I know it’s just anxiety but still. I’m scared and I’m tired. If you read this thank you, I need any advice."
1942e0f,Anxiety,2024-01-11,Best Affordable CBD,Hello! I have suffered with anxiety for a long time and it had improved some when I was in therapy but I moved and not only can’t go to my old therapist but have a lot more stressors than before. This has caused my anxiety to skyrocket to levels I haven’t experienced in a very very long time. I am searching for a new therapist in my area but I would like to try CBD to help. I’ve tried CBD flower and it helped tremendously. Smoking isn’t always something I want to do or can do and I would like to try some other form. I live in a state where regular cannabis isn’t legal so I can’t order from dispensaries. Thanks in advance!
19421nq,Anxiety,2024-01-11,Wartime anxiety,"Hello from Ukraine! Obviously, this post will be about my anxiety during war, so there will be some triggers like war and death. 

I've had anxiety issues for a long time, but obviously it got worse. When the war started i had hopes that it will end soon, that life can be fully normal again. But it's been two years already, and i have a constant anxiety that everything is getting worse. I am in a mostly safe place in Ukraine, but sometimes i am getting anxious that i can die any day. Or even worse - somebody from my family can die. Or i can be enlisted to the warzone and i will die there. For me it's the scariest one - i am terrified of a thought that any day i can lose all comfort in my life and will be living in a dugout under fire. Sometimes just a random thought or news headline is starting a snowball of thoughts which ends with ""damn, i'm gonna die soon, my life will never be normal again"". I thought that i need to go to the therapist, but I'm thinking like ""The doctor will say that it's okay, because there's a freaking war here"". I understand that this war will not end anytime soon. Everywhere there are motivational posters and ads that we need to be strong and fearless, enlist to the war and fight the enemy, but i can't be strong. Everything i want is a quiet peaceful life, and it's impossible to have one anymore. And i don't have much friends that are not here, that can support me or just have a little chat. Because a lot of meetings with local friends are getting into politics and war talks and ends with depressing thoughts.

I don't know if there is any solution, maybe i just needed somebody to read it, maybe i just needed to get this off my chest. Maybe somebody wants to chat to make it easier, or maybe i should just learn to live with it and try my best to be stronger."
1941zrb,Anxiety,2024-01-11,Typical Panic Attack?,"Hi All, 

I woke up this morning perfectly fine about 5:30am. Felt like i needed to use the bathroom, so i got up and went. As I was washing my hands I literally felt my heart pounding and going fast - immediate panic. I took my pulse, it was 110, I felt like i couldnt catch my breath, I was shaking, thought I was going to die. Went down the hall to my neighbor knocked on the door and said  I need to go to the ER. She sat me down, gave me some water. within about 10-15 minutes i was back down to around 70-80, went home and laid down. Here I sit at work now, beating back around my normal 55-60 - but Im exhausted. 

Seems like the worst of it lasts 15 minutes or so, then it kind of tapers down to normal - although I do feel some residual anxiety / on edge. I read other posts on here and people are beating 150, 190, etc. I take atenolol for HBP maybe thats keeping me a bit lower. Im still scared though :(

Another HUGE example: I use to LOVE video games - I was an OG Halo 2 player back in my day and now it is all about Fortnite and COD, so when I play with my friends in other games I tend to get nervous and anxious the same way as with my landlord.

My symptoms are so crazy that to anyone it sounds like I’m literally on the verge of organ failure .. but then no doctor is able to pick it up and all my tests are fine. after reading a lot on readit it and listening to psychology podcasts my symptoms match that of a physical anxiety attack.. however, anxiety attacks supposed to last a few minutes/hours.. I’ve been stuck with my symptoms for 4 months every single day. Can anxiety symptoms be chronic and last for months on end? Is it a nervous system dysfunction Dysautonomia or is it something else??

I am a 27 year old female, never ever had any health issues previously, went to the gym 5 days a week. I went overseas in September and was slightly anxious as I have never been on a Europe holiday, I have a hear of flying which bothered me but I thought I had it under control.. 3 weeks into my trip, I went to do the gym for a light cardio session at the gym I started to feel light headed, uncoordinated, tingles and shivers all over my body. It has now been 4 months and I still feel light headed every single day, from the moment I wake up the when I go to sleep. My tingles in my body that I felt at the start progressed to deep pain in both my lower limbs, arms, and a feeling of weakened muscles, burning. I also get episodes of parethesia, the pain spreads all over my body not just in one certain spot, I get random hot/cold shivers, sweats, and am constantly light headed every single day. I now have chest pain and feel a tight throat. Beta blockers helped with the tight throat for a few weeks but now it’s back. I stopped the beta blockers because they didn’t help much with my tight throat or light headedness and since stopping my heart rate has gone up to 90/100bpm instead of 60-70. Sometimes I feel like my chest pain is so severe that I might have A heart attack, I cough quite a bit and sometimes feel like my voice changes?? But it doesn’t. 
I have also developed a weird symptom where I urinate a lot throughout the day.. 

I have seen 4 general practitioners, cardiologist, neurologist, done 2 brain mris, leg X-rays, nuclear body scan and been tested for a bunch of stuff like general thyroid, full blood count, general chemistry, vitamin deficiency and everything is all clear. I have done physio on my cervical and my limbs which helped with the parethesia on my legs but not for the light headedness. 

I am begging anyone to help me! Is it actually dysautonomia as per my cardiologist suggestion but then I don’t have POTS or any heart problems. Could it be my body stuck on flight or fight response?  

I just feel so humiliated, debilitated, depressed, angry. My partner proposed to me while we were overseas and instead of planning a wedding I feel like I should be planning my funeral. I am losing hope."

193zzm7,Anxiety,2024-01-11,Did I lock the door ?,"Hi, 
This is my first time here and I just wanted to know if anyone suffers from what’s currently happening to me. 
I’ve not been diagnosed with anxiety or anything yet but today I’ve been experiencing something I can only classify as anxiety.
I rushed out of the house this morning and I was the last person to leave, this happened around 8am this morning it’s currently 12pm and I don’t remember locking the door.
I would usually brush this off but since our garage got broken into I’ve been worried more. 
I’ve been thinking about this since I got on the bus, my heart has been racing all day cause I keep thinking I didn’t and someone’s going to break into the house and steal from us, there’s an uncomfortable sensation in my skin and I keep thinking of how to escape work (30 minutes away from home) just to check if I did lock the doors so I can calm down.
A part of me knows I lock the door but a bigger part believes the door wasn’t locked. 
I don’t know if I need reassurance or I need something to calm me down.
Does anyone know how I can calm myself down ?"

193zlqt,Anxiety,2024-01-11,anxiety about incontinence/using the restroom. how do i tell my therapist?,"(TW: menstruation/period talk. also, tagged so no-one gets in trouble reading about poop and pee at work!)

hi there! 👋🏻

i’ve struggled with anxiety for basically my entire life, but definitely got it more under control. however, i am a person who has really severe periods and side effects from the periods, including period poops.

this is gross and horrible but, a few months ago, i sneezed while on my period - not even knowing i needed to poop! - and i shit myself, a lot. while driving my car. luckily, i was on my way home, so i went home and got everything situated, but i couldn’t stop thinking about how lucky i was. i’d just been at the grocery store; i’d just been at work. i truly could’ve shit myself ANYWHERE!

now i’m absolutely terrified of incontinence. i know it’s not bad or immoral or anything like that, but i’m afraid of just pooping or peeing everywhere in an awkward or public place. i try to only wear dark pants to work, just in case. i buy incontinence pads instead of period pads now, and layer them in my underwear on any days my stomach feels a little off, just in case. i’m terrified of being stuck in traffic and peeing or pooping myself because i’m on the highway. i even have incontinence pads (like chucks) on the seats in my car.

i’m on my period right now, and i woke up at like 3:00 am with diarrhea. i’m afraid to go to work; it’s a long drive to a twelve-hour shift. i was having a panic attack earlier, and i’m still shaking.

has anyone gone through this before? I have a therapist, but i don’t know how to bring it up to her, especially since i’m seeing her for PTSD and other stuff, so this seems so out of left field, and especially because it sort of has to do with my period, which i would feel gross talking to her about. i’m a very prudish person, i guess, and i’d feel like i was harassing her or something! what do i do?"
193zfr0,Anxiety,2024-01-11,Dealing with Avoidance Loops?,"For as long as I can remember, my only real tactic for handling things that made me anxious has been avoidance. I've become so used to doing this that by the time I'm forced to confront things, my anxiety is usually through the roof and into outer space, because I've spent all my time pushing it away and refusing to deal. After dealing with another anxiety loop this week brought on by... well... me just being me, I recognize that my fix of ""never ignore my messages ever"" is a bad fix since it doesn't teach me how to salvage things if I fail; instead it just reinforces the mentality that, well... I failed, and the anxiety comes back even stronger since I tell myself I should already know what to do.

Basically, I'm just asking if anyone has better advice for escaping an avoidance cycle beyond simply ""don't avoid the thing"". How to not crumble the moment I lapse."

I don't know how I can explain this properly, nor where to post it. but recently I have had some wierd experiences. I can be in the middle of a conversation with someone, ad then all of a sudden I don't recognize their faces anymore.  
  
It's been happening four times the last month or so. Yesterday it happened while talking to a good friend of mine. We were talking about random stuff and then, mid conversation, it's like I have never seen her face, it's completely unfamiliar, and like I see their face for the very first time. Which is also wierd since it is happening in the middle of a conversation. When it happened yesterday I had been around her for more than 2 hours...  
  
I freak out when it happens, but as soon as I look away and then look back at them it goes back to normal.  
  
I tried to Google it but I can't seem to get any other answer than face blindness aka prosopagnosia, but I don't struggle with recognizing people I meet.  
  
I am quite certain I am neurodivergent, but don't have any diagnosis yet. Don't know if it can be correlated to adhd or autism? Or maybe existential anxiety?

Before the military I was a second shifter for a long time before I joined. To this day I struggle with (falling asleep) not staying asleep or getting good sleep on my days off. Once I’m an hour out from when I should go asleep inside I dread it. I panic and watch the clock minute by minute. Once I miss 8-7 hour window for sleep it only gets worse to the point where I don’t sleep. I’ve done everything from routines, melatonin, alcohol you name aside from drugs. Nothing seems to be working now to stop and I’ve gone just about once a week with no sleep. Like right now. I’m tired of it. I don’t feel like a normal human. People tell me I look like shit and I should just sleep. Which leads to extra anxiety about sleeping the next night. I’ve had this for 3 days before. I used to think I just had some insomnia but it’s not. When I sleep I sleep great. It’s the thought of having to be in bed asleep and up for work.

193xlv3,Anxiety,2024-01-11,So I have 2 weeks taking a combination of some supplements (vitamins) and they’re actually working along with other things that I’m doing to better myself like meditation and some light exercise.. also eating healthy foods.. I’m going to recommend my regimen down below 👇🏼,"First and foremost I’m no doctor! And I get that everyone is different, different anxiety disorders different bodies, But as a person that deals with anxiety I want to at least help people somehow with my personal experiences. Again talk to your doctor before taking these vitamins.. I recommend doing at least 10 minutes of meditation daily.. some type of exercise at least for 8 minutes the more the better. Stay hydrated all day. Drink two cups of tea one with your first meal (green tea) and the other when going to bed (chamomile tea). The vitamins are K2+D3, B-Complex, omega fish oil and magnesium glycinate.. I’m going to list the links for these types of vitamins on the comment section. And again first talk with your doctor and check these types of vitamin levels.. Take the K2-D3 along with one magnesium with your first meal.. Take the omega fish oil with your last meal along with your B-complex or you can take the B-complex  in between meals.. At night when drinking your chamomile tea take another magnesium, this will help falling asleep in a calmer state.. This might not work for everyone but I know how horrible it can be dealing with an anxiety disorder. Hope this helps at least one of you guys.."

We went and had a few beers with him and he directed most of the conversation at me. He asked me what I want to do for a job etc and we talked about lots of stuff about trying new things and so on and I told him I’m not very motivated because my mental health isn’t good. 

I told him mostly about my anxiety and what caused it and depression and so on and I teared up. He helped me and gave me his phone number and told me to ring him anytime I need help. He made me feel so much better. 

He hugged me and helped me when I cried and told me that he cares and that no matter what happens I will never burden him with my problems (which is a fear of mine).

 This didn’t make much sense but I’m too tired to think at the moment but I just thought I’d share because it made me feel so much happier. It feels good to be cared about when you think no one cares about you.

193x9re,Anxiety,2024-01-11,hypochondriac?,"not sure if this is the correct sub for this, but I’ve seen others talk about hypochondria on here so. (Sorry if this is a huge wall of text) 
Ever since middle school I’ve had severe anxiety regarding just about everything, but especially when it came to contracting things or having health issues/scares. (For example: I didn’t go to school for a week and a half because we got a letter someone in our class had lice and I laid awake at night with phantom itches for that entire week and refused to go to school.) My mom used to joke all the time that I was a “hypochondriac like her”, and I always thought it was something to joke about. When I reached high school it just got worse, and I came to realize my mom was not a hypochondriac at all (at least from the way she acted, always waving my fears off and telling me I was overdramatic when I came to her with fears of health issues such as cancer or whatnot). My fears only got worse as high school went on. I’m now graduated and it’s the worse it’s ever been. There hasn’t been one night where I haven’t kept myself up on the verge of a panic attack over a health scare/issue. Here’s the thing though: it’s not as bad as I’ve seen other people have it. When I read up on hypochondria it’s always people checking themselves over 100+ times, or “planning their funeral”, etc. I just get so anxious to the point I drive myself to a panic attack and shut down physically and emotionally. Would anyone consider this hypochondriac behavior or even in the realms of it, or just mere severe anxiety? Sorry if this was a stupid question, but I don’t want to call myself a hypochondriac if that’s not what this is, I feel that’s unfair for people who may actually be a hypochondriac."
193x6rl,Anxiety,2024-01-11,"My extreme lack of focus could be due to anxiety, not ADHD?","To keep it short, I have general anxiety disorder, occasional depressive episodes (thankfully, not for a very long time, hope it stays that way) and ADHD. I was diagnosed with both by mental health professionals. I used to think my inability to focus is caused by ADHD, but now I think it's anxiety. I severely worry about health and everyday stuff that's out of our control. The state of the world doesn't help. I've recently lost a few pets to sudden illness, and I have some anxiety over starting a new career at 35 after quitting my long time profession. Thankfully, I no longer watch tv or news, as it's honestly too much to handle mentally.But, and this is the problem, I basically constantly check my phone and e mail out of fear something bad might happen if I'm not around to answer a call, message or an important e-mail. I used to think it's about the usual suspects of terminally online people like dopamine hits from social media and bad habits in general, but it's actually not about that. I wish to be free of this fear of missing something important and being scared of bad news constantly.I'm also very fearful about sudden illness and health in general (my dad died very shortly after being diagnosed with cancer a few years ago) and lately traffic accidents. There are days I can't drive out of fear of an accident. I also fear financial inability to take care of myself, especially since I quit my long term job and switched to a new and more insecure career path in a field I actually enjoy and feel is authentic.I have some better days and bad days. Sometimes I can finish a task and do everything I planned more or less, but on a bad day I can't concentrate if I have something planned later in the day, I constantly overthink about everything, I'm late with my deadlines and constantly procrastinate which makes my fear of bad consequences worse. And then I fall into this endless loop where I put off things but also tremble in fear of what will happen if I continue putting it off. Health checks being one of those.

I used to think I know how anxiety works, because it usually manifested as panic attacks and some mild catastrophizing, but this is becoming executive dysfunction hell and I need help. None of my therapists ever focused on this or asked question about it.

How do you cope?

Edit: I forgot to mention I was prescribed benzodiazepines (Helex - alprazolam) which helped but I extremely disliked taking them since they made me feel very drowsy. I'm not on any meds now."
193wz6j,Anxiety,2024-01-11,panic attacks/anxiety attacks everyday for the past week I can’t sleep nor eat i don’t know what to do to make it go away.,"so i’m 17 years old i have suffered from anxiety my whole life. there was only one time i had gotten this bad with panic attacks which was summer of 2022. i was sick that summer and the whole summer i had panic attacks just like this. i couldn’t sleep or eat but now it’s happening again. i recently started a new high school in august it’s a huge school, looks like a college. i’m a junior this year and i graduated early next year. when i first started school i was scared but not this scared, i eventually made friends and had a great first semester. but then christmas break came around i was out for 2 weeks and 3 days. i just started my second semester yesterday. 3 days before is when i started getting super nervous about it, because new classes and i don’t have that many friends. turns out i have no classes with my friends nor do i have a lunch with any of them so im all alone. the school is so big that i still don’t see them throughout the day till dismissal in the car rider line. my panic attacks started 2 nights before i went to school. i figured maybe once i got the day over with my panic attacks would go away so i took my anxiety meds the night before and when i woke up. it only helped a little. i still didnt sleep but for 1 hour the night before i had to go to school even after taken the meds. i got the day over with and i thought i was doing pretty okay when i got home but then i decided to try to take a nap and woke up panicking. now im not getting any sleep tonight and i have to get up for school in 3 hours. i need advice pls. i want this feeling to go away. i keep trying to tell myself that even though im alone in all my classes and at lunch dont mean it will last forever. but my body thinks otherwise. pls help."
193wq7z,Anxiety,2024-01-11,My anxiety and OCD was caused by a Bartonella infection that went misdiagnosed and untreated for 2 decades,"Bartonella infects the endothelial cell and evades the immune system causing low grad systemic inflammation, especially in the brain. This can result in almost any symptom but many have anxiety and OCD. After treating with long term antibiotics and opening up the NRF2 gene pathway (for detox) my OCD is gone. If you have other symptoms besides mental issues like fatigue and insomnia, tendon pain, heart, or eye issues it could be bartonella. The issue is average run of the mill doctors are not trained on how to properly identify, diagnose and treat a bartonella infection. To make it worse, infectious disease doctors are part of the problem due to their status quo they claim it is a non issue and use non sensitive antibody testing to confirm (false) negative testing when the best testing method is not covered by insurance, usually never ordered. The best testing will be looking for the RNA of the bacteria with a FISH assay. I tested negative via labcorp/quest antibody tests but positive with Igenex FISH assay and Immunoblot IgG which is more sensitive then regular western blots. 

  
Here is a write up of scientists finding bartonella in the blood of a patient with schizophrenia.

193wois,Anxiety,2024-01-11,Does anybody else just go into freeze mode ?,"When I’m feeling on the verge of a panic/anxiety attack I go into freeze mode. I can’t walk, I have to sit down or lay down, I can’t eat, I can’t do anything. I try to focus on my breathing and I try to focus on “not dying”. 
My panic attacks tend to be severe, I’m embarrassed the hospital staff is familiar with me. 

Unfortunately a lot of the times I can be really anxious all day, and sometimes I will lay around all day waiting for my anxiety to go away. If I try to walk around I get winded, I start to get short of breath and my heart rate shoots up high af."
193w9md,Anxiety,2024-01-11,I worry that everyone on earth will randomly disappear… any tips on how to manage this?,"First of all, for clarity: I do go to therapy and see doctors regularly. Not looking for medical advice, just general advice. 

So my whole life I’ve had horrible abandonment issues which turned into separation anxiety, thinking that the moment I lose track of people I trust/safe people, they will leave. I used to think they would on purpose, like they hate me and just pack up and leave. But it turned into thinking that everyone on earth will just randomly disappear when I’m not looking. So when I wake up and I don’t know where anyone is, I panic. When I’m alone for a while, I panic. I can’t stay home alone for the same reasons. 

I don’t actually believe it to be true. I know it’s irrational and I know it’s OCD. But that doesn’t change how it feels. 

I know it’s because I don’t think I’m capable of handling things on my own. I don’t think I’m strong enough to handle my emotions by myself at all. So trying to imagine a situation where I’m all alone forever and no one to help me is terrifying. But I’m also afraid of the anxiety itself. So I’m afraid of checking to see if someone is still there and they’re outside or somewhere I don’t know, so I freak out. 

My main issues right now are waking up in the morning and being with people but they’re in a separate area (like in the basement, aka somewhere where I don’t know exactly where they are)
The more I try and resist my compulsions the worse it is, because the longer I go on without getting confirmation that people are “still there” the more I think it’s true. I try and distract myself but it’s like a burning fire in the back of my mind and I can’t get it to stop. 

Anyways. If you have any advice or just support I’d greatly appreciate it."

193v55u,Anxiety,2024-01-11,Acceptance vs. Complacency,"Acceptance vs. Complacency

More often than not, people confuse complacency for acceptance. 

Complacency is often being aware of something in our lives that might bother us but lazily choosing not to do anything about it whereas, acceptance is more about mindful awareness and also recognises our desire to do something about it which requires both consciousness and courage. 

It requires being honest to ourselves but that can only come with true acceptance."

I don’t have them all day everyday, but I experience them frequently. Right now, I’ve been feeling them on and off for about a day. They are never really, really high either. 

However… if I check my heart rate, it’s almost always within the normal range (60-100 bpm). So, I don’t know why I can’t just accept the sensation and not worry too much about it anymore. 

Don’t really have any other symptoms. In the past, my EKGs and routine labs have come out normal. I’m only taking vitamin D supplements because I was deficient of it. 

Anyone else experiencing the same? Please provide advice. Much appreciated!"

197hpkj,Anxiety,2024-01-15,Too nervous to see a therapist,"I (17M) think that I most likely have anxiety. Looking at some of the posts on this sub, I follow similar symptoms to most people. This is really affecting my daily life. I have been trying to face my fears a little bit - for example I try to put my hand up for at least one question per day in school, and I’ve also tried making basic conversation with strangers, like asking for the time or something (even if I already know it, just want to practise going up to people). Generally, one to one social situations aren’t as bad for me as it seems they are for some people on here. 

My main issue is public speaking. I once gave a presentation in front of just one teacher and absolutely despised it - tried everything I could to avoid it and when I couldn’t, was shaking and my voice was trembling the whole time. Something about reading stuff out in front of people just really gets me for some reason. For my computer science class, we each have to give a presentation to the rest of the class and I’m genuinely terrified.

I kinda want to see a therapist, but I don’t want my parents to know that I’m seeing a therapist or that I have anxiety since they will make a massive deal out of it. I don’t know how to tell them that I want to see a therapist. I think having an actual mental health professional, and also being able to access drugs like propranolol for this presentation (among other things) would be a lot more beneficial to me. I also want a job, but I’m far too nervous for all the social interaction. I do genuinely want to get better, but I can’t see myself giving a presentation in front of the whole class without drugs. 

Does anyone have any advice regarding therapy, or generally overcoming these fears? Thanks"

Basically my mother has been a severe alcoholic for 40 years, had been picked up by the police numerous times for being drunk in public or for being called for welfare checks. She has been taken to the ER but released when sobered up. She refuses treatment or getting help. She constantly calls me drunk, leaves nasty messages etc. 

I have hyper vigilance, controlling tendencies, can’t sleep, retreat to be alone often. Don’t have fun, can’t concentrate enough for tv or books anymore, have lots of muscle aches and tension, headaches, et etc. I thought that was just my personality but I’m realizing now it’s severe anxiety. I thought that because I could function, do chores, exercise and go to work that I was fine. My doctor prescribes me trazodone for sleep which is helping but also suggested I add in Zoloft. I’m really nervous about the side effects and can’t deal with feeling off/insomnia while also working full time. That itself is causing me anxiety. I’m considering taking a medical leave from work to allow myself time to adjust to Zoloft without needing to work. I really need sleep so this might be best for me if it causes insomnia. I guess what I’m asking is how long should I try trazodone alone before adding Zoloft? Would adding Zoloft with trazodone be a good idea? Is taking a leave a good idea?

Until one day, last summer, when I ate a meal and took the time to chew the food... and that meal called my whole life into question.  
  
After about twenty minutes, I felt a subtle sensation, as if I'd extracted the energy encapsulated in the food, whereas usually I just ate for the taste, and then the food weighed in my belly. In this case, I had a real gain in energy, as if I had accumulated the electricity of the food through chewing. It was incredible, I felt good for the first time in my life, no more anxiety, no more bloated feeling, a fiery energy, as if my blood was finally awake. And above all, for the first time in my life, I had felt true serenity. Normally I'd eaten like a goose, but no, I'd eaten a small amount, which gave me considerable energy, and I clearly knew that I was no longer hungry.  
  
It was great, I went on with my life and didn't look any further.  
  
To this day, it's all I think about, all I look for, but I can't get the energy out. It's like I'm missing a variable.

196e13y,Anxiety,2024-01-14,I Am Feeling Fed Up And Could Use Some Advice,"For starters I am a 21yo female and I have made a LOT of strides with my anxiety/fear of going out/socialization in the last couple of years - I finally lost my virginity at 19/went out on dates, tried meeting new friends off bumble bff, and worked my first few jobs (both in and out of the house), and I also do way better with phone/video calls now after long exposure, and I also sought out therapy and mental health help..  
  
On the flip side I lost all my insurance and cannot afford anything right now health wise, I still am trying to get my drivers license but keep failing the written test due to anxiety/adhd (adhd meds fuck me up and ive been trying my best but it's hard depending on my parent for a ride when they hate going anywhere anyway), and going out is hard when you are broke and have nothing to do so your only interaction is your family (I do college but it's online and the online clubs and such I participate in are online), and finding a job has been the WORST.  
  
I feel like I am never going to get my license to the point it just makes me angry every time I go to the DMV just to fail it honestly makes me feel like the dumbest person on earth.. it's also hard with the job situation because there are jobs near me (live in a bad area), but they are ALL super physical, retail, or restaurants... (I have chronic pain, tried working at a restaurant and didn't fit in with the go, go, go personalities and high school clique attitude and I sucked at food service because I couldn't keep up with my adhd and my anxiety turned me into a mute), I had another job from home at a call center basically and it lasted longer (2 weeks instead of 2 days), but the main guy I talked to drove me to a breakdown and the company was really awful.. and the first job I ever had I worked at for 4 months as IT Support and could have seen myself working there longer but my boss gave me an insane workload and we didn't see eye to eye with certain things so I had to move on.  
  
So the driving situation sucks and honestly speaking I hate when people say ""Just work for exposure therapy it'll get better!"" .. Not saying it's not possible but I know my limits.. if I can't do remote work I could see myself doing data entry, stocking jobs, phone/computer/paperwork jobs outside of the house but it's hard to find those sorts of jobs and I know with my issues it's basically a dumpster fire if  
  
I chose a job that required heavy social interaction with tons of people in my face everyday that would drive me to insanity.. but I feel intense guilt about having these limitations (even as a secretary/receptionist that would be hard because you have to greet people ALL the time and I know how cliquey those environments are).  
  
I just would love any support/advice that makes me feel like less of a loser lol, thanks. :)

TW: mentions of health

so, I (19F) have very recently been dealing with some pretty nasty anxiety and mild depression. I had my very first panic attack on halloween this year and i haven’t been the same since. these attacks i’ve had have sent me to the emergency room about 4 times already. i am so angry and frustrated with this because growing up i was never SUPER anxious or anything crazy, at least i think, and this one night i suddenly felt like i was suffocating like i was getting enough air and i started hyperventilating and i had to go to the ER and they did so many test and i was totally fine and the week and a half after my life was hell because i had no idea what was happening and no one mentioned anxiety. i genuinely thought i was going to die because everyday i had this sense of impending doom and unease and i didn’t feel like myself at all along with some derealization. it was all so scary and i felt so so so alone, but a after that week of hell i had a coworker mentions the company HERS and mental health and it sounds like anxiety. She has struggled a lot with mental health after suffering some traumatic shit like the loss of 2 sons under some awful circumstances. i then took the little test on HERS and it said i seem to struggle with severe anxiety and moderate depression and that was some bad news but also a huge weight off my chest because i thought “oh thank god i’m not alone this is a common thing just some anxiety!” but i was wrong it is so much more and it affects the people around me too, not just myself, and that hurts the most. i hate seeing what it’s done to my parents and my poor boyfriend who has been my rock during all of this, he has helped me through some of my worst moments, i hate seeing how hard it is on the people around me. i feel so riddled with guilt because why has this come on so suddenly for no reason, there was no stressor i was just watching TV and eating candy i and now my life is so different. i can’t enjoy food anymore without thinking it’ll kill me or ill have an allergic reaction, i can’t get my heart rate up too much or i think ill have a heart attack, if my breathing feels off i feel like im suffocating, i become so hyper aware of any sensation in my body, im scared of medicine for some reason? and i haven’t been officially diagnosed and i haven’t been able to talk to a psychiatrist or a doctor about this and its all so frustrating and i feel so alone sometimes and like im trapped in my own mind and i want my old self back i want my own life i want to enjoy simple things again i am only 19 yet i feel like my life is ruined…"
193udi7,Anxiety,2024-01-11,Heart flutters from anxiety?,"I have a phobia (which is a type of anxiety disorder) which I overthink things all the time and get super nervous when overthinking, I don't have severe anxiety because I have only had a few panic attacks, but I do have anxiety, but I've notice that my heart flutters almost like it skips a beat, like once a day, this also happens to my cousin who also has anxiety, but sometimes I also get chest pains in the center of my chest, I'm wondering if this happens to anybody else."
193u3zp,Anxiety,2024-01-11,Depersonalization/Derealization,"How can I mitigate these feelings?

I have struggled with the feeling of “not being real” for over severe years now. I was diagnosed with GAD, OCD, SAD, PTSD, pretty much all of the anxiety disorders known to man. I take Zoloft to manage my anxiety but the one thing has lingered is my depersonalization/derealization. I was relieved to find out that there was a name for what I was feeling as you all know it is almost impossible to describe. 

That being said, it is still hard to pinpoint exactly how I feel when I go through this depersonalization. It often happens when I am driving (especially alone) as I have car anxiety from being in accidents. I feel as if I am not real nor is the world around me. It is so hard to explain as it is such an unsettling feeling. Are there any tips on how to mitigate this?"
193u3cg,Anxiety,2024-01-11,I have alot of anxiety about the future of my family.,"I'm almost 30 still living at home. My dad is in the hospital he almost had a stroke and might have organ damage because he apparently hasn't been taking his meds for the past few years, my sister is basically non functioning due to mental health issues. We're not well off and my mom has health issues she's definitely hiding from us. I personally deal with my own mental health issues and I don't want to tell my family because it won't help anyone and it doesn't change anything. I feel so helpless that I can't do anything. I don't even know what to say. 

I'm not very smart or skilled and I feel like I'm running out of time before I have to watch my family suffer because I'm not strong enough to help. If I could make more money or if my brain wasn't all screwed up I could do something worth wild. I want to give up but I know I can't."
193u03i,Anxiety,2024-01-11,I don’t know how to explain how I’m feeling but it’s incredibly awful,"I’ve been feeling this way for the past week and it’s just gotten worse every day, I’m not sure what/why, and I’m not sure if it’s an anxiety symptom or depression or some mix of both. It’s like I’m “in between” two separate sides of me and it’s causing me to become restless. 

First of all, I’m mentally exhausted all the time, but I have a strong desire to do things. I get both on and off but now it’s all the time and it’s so intense I feel like pulling my hair out. I really really want to be making art and cleaning and other stuff… but my brain is just refusing. I have the motivation but not the capacity. Which is making me feel like a failure and sad because I genuinely want to do things and can’t. 

Second of all, I’m always super hungry but have no appetite. I can feel my body just wanting food and wanting to be satisfied but I have absolutely zero appetite for anything. Unfortunately for me, if I don’t have an appetite for something my body will physically reject it and I’d break down in tears before I could force myself to eat it. So all I’ve been eating is like pretzels and stuff, which isn’t enough to satisfy me so I’m feeling so unsatisfied and uncomfortable all the time. 

Thirdly, I’ll randomly just get so restless and there isn’t anything I can do to relieve it. It causes me to bang my hands against the wall or even slap myself. Like so much pent up energy that can’t be expelled and it’s physically painful and clouds up my brain. I can’t sleep or eat or do anything. Nothing feels enjoyable or relaxing. 

Idk why exactly I’m writing this, but if anyone has experience something similar I’d appreciate hearing about it."

Not much pain though, got checked by doctors and my blood pressure is normal, blood tests are normal, brain imaging is somehow normal, but it feels like when I’m just in the quiet and trying to relax that a phone is just playing a tinnitus video against my ear, it’s actually torture. Atp im convinced I have some rare disease thats gonna kill me, ive hade this gor a year now and can’t really tell if it keeps getting worse but generally it’s just bad. I feel alone, the only thing I can’t hang onto is that im not in any physical pain unless my neck maybe has a little ache."
193ttap,Anxiety,2024-01-11,I want to quit my new job,"Hi folks. I just started a new job on Tuesday, it's a dog grooming position. My first day was okay but you can tell ive kind of walked into a shit show. My trainer was talking poorly about the bosses and made it seem like they're really mean, and because they were short staffed I was just told to start drying these dogs without any instruction. I dried 5 dogs and brushed them out but had pretty much no idea what I was doing. The whole place is so loud and stress inducing and it is so exhausting to work with these animals. I thought it would be perfect because no dealing with people, just dogs, and I love animals, but this place is family owned and has way too many clients to workers. 


I called in sick today because as soon as I heard my alarm going off I was in an instant panic. They were nice enough about me calling in but now I have to go back tomorrow and I'm freaking out. I so badly just want to tell the manager that it's not for me, but obviously I don't have anything else lined up. I know it's not much but I have about $3k in savings so I could cover myself until I got a new job. 


I guess I'm writing this for someone to tell me it's okay to quit, lol /: thanks for reading either way. What kind of jobs do yall have??"

193tkb5,Anxiety,2024-01-11,Calling Off Work,"TL;DR: Is it okay to call off the rest of this week when I only worked 1 day last week? I do not feel great but I guess I could work? 

hey guys. So I've been genuinely sick (bad case of bronchitis) for like 2 weeks. Doctors didn't treat it properly the first round, so they threw me on some steroids. Also, I started a job in the beginning of December (I hate it, I cry and shake my entire drive to work). So last week was a 4 day week, I worked 1 day, Got sent home 1 day, and called off the other two. I still felt horrible beginning of this week, (before I was put on 4 new meds) I got sent home Monday. I have a doctor's note for Monday and Tuesday but I called off today, and I feel like my world is falling apart if I even think about going into work the rest of this week. Like I cannot even think about this job without bursting into tears. I have an interview for another job Saturday. (The thought of quitting also makes me panic because I'm unsure of how to do it professionally.I hate face to face confrontation)

 I just want to know what some other peoples thoughts are on calling off, am I being dramatic? I don't want to get fired but at the same time it wouldn't be that bad because I hate this job. It's a desk job and my heart rate  will be 120 all day sitting completely still (very high for resting for me). and then I'll cry my entire lunch break. I cry the entire drive home, shower, eat dinner, cry myself to sleep and then repeat the cycle. The manager is nice, the pay and benefits are great it is just not a good fit for me at all. I've been struggling finding a good job since I moved  about 10 months ago. 

I don't know I just feel kind of overwhelmed and feel like I'm milking being sick but at the same time I have a nasty cough still. 

any advice is welcome. I'm feeling kind of down in general. Thanks!"
193tjq4,Anxiety,2024-01-11,I think my anxiety is ruining my life.,"I have extremely severe and genetic anxiety. I cannot remember ever not having anxiety, even in kindergarten, I would call home daily due to anxiety symptoms. I am on high doses of multiple medications that truly do help me, but I still am constantly anxious. I go to therapy every other week. I just lose out on so much. I feel like I am forced to give up on opportunities that I really want because my anxiety makes me feel like I am going to die any time I try something new. It makes me so complacent, because I just want to feel comfortable, even thought that does not exist for me. I have people who hold my hand through every task because if I do not, I get so overwhelmed that I freeze. I try to push myself out of my comfort zone at least once a week, such as going outside, going to an event alone, messaging my friends, small stuff like that, but this does not help me feel more comfortable. If anything, it makes me more anxious because I start thinking about everything I did and every interaction I have with people haunts me. 

I just do not know what to do at this point. I am in my early 20s and I just feel like I will not be able to live well if I continue this path. I think I am going to ask my therapist about group therapy. I already have lost so many years to anxiety and other mental illness. I do not know what more I can try. I feel bad constantly asking for help, which makes me anxious (of course) because I feel like my friends and family will eventually find me to be too much. 

If you also feel like this, I understand you. "
193tf3i,Anxiety,2024-01-11,Questions on Lexapro and hydroxyzine.,"I’m 20 with anxiety. I’ve been on these meds for about a month or two now? Maybe almost 2 months. Before getting on these meds one night i felt like i was about to have a stroke/heart attack, not sure if it was because I have heart problems or if i felt something in my body and my mind just panicked. Once i feel the slightest thing going on with my body my mind just goes into overdrive. I was also bullied in my early teens so i think that’s why i had anxiety, i didnt act like the stereotypical black guy + i’ve been jobless for 4 months and i didn’t have these issues… well i still had anxiety but not oh shit i’m about to die! anxiety. I’ve been feeling like my heart rate is too low or too high but maybe it’s because I’m nervous about dying. Lexapro makes me drowsy and kinda calms me down and hydroxyzine turns me into a zombie until i try to fight to sleepiness off. Can someone tell me about the symptoms because i honestly think i’m living out my last days."
193t7xd,Anxiety,2024-01-11,Life troubles,"My name is Jack. I live in supported accommodation for people with mental health that accomate people with mental health, I am on the benefits system and I do have Personal independence payment. 

Recently over the past 6 weeks I've been suffering with overwhelming stress, depression &amp; anxiety. I work 14 hours a week on a construction site.

Im not sleeping at night I wake up every hour of the night and everday there always seems to be a stressful issue for example,

My mother/ father have fallen out over me wanting my inheritance money from my. Granmar, everyone else in the family have received it but me. 

Not so recently a guy living upstairs from me who takes alot of drug's has threatened to stab me with a knife, -(I did report this to the police) 

I need this money for me and my wife to help us move out of this supported accommodation but my familys reasoning is that I will spend all of the inheritance money

Me and my wife need to move out of this supported living but we are on a very low banding so it's going to take a long while before we move out, we have looked at private renting but again we are both not in employment, I'm only doing work experience and most private landlords require at least someone to be working and have a gaurentoor if our credit is not 600 plus.

Im really struggling with life and my wife has accidently read my private journal which expresses how I'm feeling, it's hurt her feelings and she's processing them right now. 
 
Every day there always seems to be a problem or a growing pain, I like to go to work experience because I want to make an effort in life and have a good house and future for our family. 

We are trying for a kid but my sex drive is so low at the moment because of what I'm. Going through. I almost feel that every week. There is a problem or multiple problems thrown at me

I have written down my feelings and expression down on paper which has helped me a little bit. 

I am taking a SSRI called Trazodone and I go to the hydro pool (basically a very large jacuzzi with other features) I sometimes go
On walks at night with my wife but I'm still struggling so much 

Ive tried going to a mental health charity and using the samaritans but neither have been good for me. 

If anyone could suggest or help me in my life
Please do so in the comments. 

Jack."

I’ve managed to stop feeling all my physical symptoms, not worry about my health, I still have regular anxiety often but it’s not quite health anxiety where I think I’m dying. I do have the flu right now though. My fever has been anywhere between 99.4 and 102.9 when I was under a bunch of blankets. I’m so anxious about this fever and what it could do to me and being sick in general. Im horrified of having Covid because the first time I had it I literally thought I was going to die and I had been vaccinated and worked with people with Covid from 2020-2022 and never got it until I quit my CNA jobs. COVID really fucked up my health anxiety and turned my “hypochondria” as my family would say into full blown health anxiety about EVERYTHING. Illness is always the one thing that will guaranteed bring me back. The nurse line asked me to take my o2 and my pulse ox is a huge trigger for me so I had to hide it after I used it so I’d have to get up to grab it to use it which I do not want to do rn.

For context, they schedule you with different doctors depending on availability. The last doctor I scheduled with prescribed me 0.5 mg clonazepam for a 30 day supply with no issue. This time around, the doctor I was assigned to said that due to new legislation citing clonazepam as a controlled substance, that I would need to go into their clinic in person in order to get a refill. 

Is this true? I have severe anxiety and insomnia and have run out of meds. My in person appointment isn’t until next Saturday. I’m struggling with anxiety and sleep - haven’t slept more than 3 hours each day in the last 5 days."
193sfqa,Anxiety,2024-01-11,Anxious,Hey everyone! I’ve had generalized anxiety my whole life with some depression sprinkled in. I’ve been on Lexapro 20mg daily for 2ish months and I’ve been prescribed Buspirone 2x a day but I haven’t started yet from anxiety over side effects of a new med. I’ve been okay but today I had 2 back to back panic attacks in the store with my 2 year old son. The first was intense and I have no idea how I didn’t pass out from it. I made it outside but my son was so upset we abandoned the cart and his new blanket and chips. I felt it pass so I went back in and started to get in line to check out. It happened again. I made it to the bathroom and called my husband. I somehow managed to check out and make it to the car before absolutely breaking down crying from it. Almost didn’t make it home from residual anxiety symptoms and had to pull over a few times. I feel like an absolute failure and like this is a huge set back in my mental health. I haven’t had a panic attack in so long and this puts so much fear into me about leaving the house again. It all happened today but I almost feel like i can barely remember it? If that makes sense. I know it happened but my body is so physically and mentally and emotionally drained from it that my mind is almost blocking the day out. I barely remember checking out or getting home or the rest of the day. I’m in such a high anxiety mind right now.

Sorry if this post has already been made, im new to how reddit works. But I need some advice man, its been years and I still feel this debilitating anxiety, you know the racing heart rate, sweaty palms, ect. 

I've been seeing a therapist for around 6 months and nothing has changed!!! I tell him im tired of anxiety, the constant loop. But then somehow he changes the topic and I leave the sessions with NOTHING!! I just go back to my anxiety filled life. Im also a senior in high school so you know anxiety everyday kinda thing, and its just I cant control It! People say constant exposure but having been in school you would think I would start to ease up but no its just the same thing.

I've also been in a situation where i thought i was going to die in 2020 i had that ""health anxiety""  i thought i wasn't going to live to see today yet i still feel limp at the thought of speaking in front of others. I've been doing it every day yet nothing changes im still limp at the thought. 

Sorry for the paragraphs but i gotta try something i gotta presentation tomorrow, but not just that my entire life is going downhill. Im borderline passing, got finals, and I have NO ONE!! not even one person I can call a friend. People somehow know my name but dont even look at me. And i constantly have that feeling that they are. Its weird like depression/anxiety kinda thing.

(Yes ive been diagnosed with depression too.)

any advice helps"
193s37f,Anxiety,2024-01-11,Severe avoidance anxiety about checking important emails and messages,"The longest I've gone without checking my emails and messages (text messages and discord) has been months on end - it gets especially bad when compounded with severe depression, where I can't get out of bed for months on end (I'm already getting mental health support and restarting my medication dosage but it's literally not enough)

I try to tell myself that it's going to be okay, just read the email , but I always delay it- After delaying it, I will give myself the very same prep talk the next day but then I just avoid it more and more

I am self-conscious and very emotionally sensitive- I have a great deal of fear surrounding opening emails/checking messages/checking online posts I've made (e.g. reddit posts) because I fear that I will receive some bad news, that people will negatively judge me in some way, or that they will end up ignoring my text/email/message (at certain points in my life, I've sent out important messages/emails/texts only for them to be ignored by the person I sent them to)

Should I just ""suck it up"" and boldly open my emails without hesitation and read them and expose myself to the fear?

Has anyone been in a similar situation where they have avoidance fear of opening emails/checking messages because they're afraid something bad will happen, because they're afraid others will judge them negatively, etc.? I feel like I'm the worst case situation in the world because I never hear about cases as severe as mine"

193rzlj,Anxiety,2024-01-11,insanely tense neck and shoulders,"i’ve been struggling with tense shoulders for as long as I can remember at this point. I have CPTSD and I’ve had severe anxiety since i was a child. I definitely hold all of my emotions in my shoulders.
I started trying to do something about this a few months ago. I started getting massages and after a couple of them I was told that the muscles in my shoulders were locked and that massage alone would not help. 
So I started seeing a chiropractor, and they told me that my C5 vertebrae was a mess and that the muscles in my shoulders were having to manually move my head. So I started seeing the chiropractor once a week and getting a massage once a month- I saw a huge difference in my posture and a small change in discomfort. But my shoulders are still so tense that people actually gasp if they touch them. Described as trying to massage a brick wall. I still cannot figure out how to get my shoulders to relax.
Some things i’m doing: 
Started wearing my night guard every single night for TMJ. 
Doing about 15-20 minutes of guided stretching before bed (after a hot shower) 
Overall working on reducing stress 
Rubbing tiger balm (menthol rub) on neck and shoulders nightly 
Laying on a heating pad 
I go to therapy regularly

Im honestly not even sure how to relax my shoulders. i’ve tried doing PMR and i can tense the muscles more, but when i release them they still are just as tight.

I’m looking for advice for a couple of things if anyone is able to help- 

For the life of me I cannot relax my muscles when I get a massage focused on my shoulders. The environment is comfortable, I don’t have any issues with being touched. Full body massage is not a problem at all but as soon as they touch my shoulders everything tenses up, the feeling of the muscles being pinched and moved around literally makes me nauseous with discomfort. i’ve tried going sober and going high, i also always take a hot shower beforehand to try and relax. Apparently tensing during a massage makes it pretty counterproductive. Is there anything else that I can do to reduce that discomfort and relax?

I have been told that sleeping on my back with a thinner pillow will help with shoulder tension. I have been a side and stomach sleeper my whole life, any tips on making this transition?

Any stretches i should definitely not be missing out on?

any advice at all would be appreciated. thank you so much in advance"
193ryiw,Anxiety,2024-01-11,Need some suggestions on my past anxiety story,"Hello everyone, today I want to share with you my journey as a long-term anxiety sufferer, hoping to find resonance and understanding through communication.  
My journey with anxiety began in high school, at a boarding school. At that time, my fear of making mistakes led me to constantly check my work, hoping everything would be perfect. As time went by, this anxiety and obsessive-compulsive disorder gradually worsened, affecting my studies and life, and brought me a deep sense of defeat.  
I would like to share two events that particularly affected my mindset:  
Once, I woke up in the middle of the night to find my pants had been taken off. Because of the tense relationship with my roommate, I began to suspect that he played a prank on me at night, perhaps taking off my pants while I was asleep and taking pictures of me to mock me. I was very sensitive about the size of my genitals, which made me even more anxious. Although I tried to convince myself that this was just my imagination and unrelated to my roommate, I could not find any evidence to dispel this thought. This suspicion cast a shadow over my entire semester.  
Driven by the sense of defeat from anxiety and OCD, I began to indulge in visiting pornographic websites, trying to escape reality in this way. On the other hand, I joined the school's drama club, trying to escape my anxiety through acting. However, it wasn't long before my activity on pornographic websites was discovered by the school and spread among my friends. I felt extremely ashamed. I had always thought of myself as a positive person with a good image, and this incident completely shattered my self-image. To maintain my image, I vehemently denied it and claimed my computer had been hacked. I received support from my friends in the drama club, but I knew I was lying. To this day, I am still afraid of being associated with topics related to ""sex"" because, in my subconscious, I am constantly trying to prove that I have nothing to do with those websites. I fear that being linked to them would confirm the lie I told in the past.  
Although these events happened over a decade ago, I still find it difficult to fully accept myself. I want to share my story here and hear your thoughts and suggestions.  
Thank you!"

The thing though is that my anxiety is REALLY bad and 24/7 just at my baseline. Just the thought of taking this pill, my body is reacting in activation. My body is constantly stuck in fight or flight. This would be my first SSRI. 

- All of my muscles feel like they are glued and locked tight. They constantly twitch. 
- I never feel like I can relax. I feel like I need to jump out of my skin. 
- I pace my house constantly because I can't relax 
- Air Hunger 
- I have constant looping dreadful thoughts. 
- I have horrendous insomnia where it feels like my entire body has restless leg syndrome.  
- severe depression where I no longer connect or feel joy

193r2de,Anxiety,2024-01-11,Is this a symptom of anxiety?,"Hello, I’ve been dealing with anxiety for about 5 months now and it’s centered around my heart mostly I catch myself checking my heart rate 12 times a day and if I see my heart rate in the 100-90s I think I’m gonna have a heart attack, anyway I’ve been experiencing symptoms like weird pressure in my throat and sometimes it’s sudden like as if someone took there hand and push really fast on my throat. It scares me some cause I’ve been experiencing since my anxiety has begun and I’ve had all kinds of heart test ekg, ECG, echocardiogram, heart monitor, bloodwork, enzymes test, heart ultrasound etc so I’m confident my heart is ok and lastly my PCP started me on 10mg Paxil which is helping some but I still experience my chest pain and such as so with back pain that radiates to my chest and vise versa. But yea if anyone has experienced this I’d love to know and see how you cope. Thanks"
193qwyn,Anxiety,2024-01-11,Tongue and jaw pain,"Does anyone else clench their jaw so badly they end up in physical pain? I grind my teeth at night and bite my tongue. When life is hard and my anxiety peaks, I do it during the day uncontrollably as well. I won’t even notice I’ve been doing it until I am sore everywhere. I also shove the tip of my tongue between my teeth and have a pretty much permanent cut there because of it. 

My clenched jaw gives me head and tooth aches as well as bite marks on my tongue. The jamming of my tongue into my teeth eventually makes the muscles of my tongue sore and I can’t get my tongue to lay comfortably in my mouth. If I tense like this all day, by the end of the day I can feel pain all down through my neck, into my jaw and on all the edges of my tongue. I’ve even strained the lil connector string (lmao I always forget what it’s called) on the bottom of my tongue. 

How in the world do you control this? I already do it quite often even during normal times, but currently my partner is life threateningly ill. Every day is quite scary. My already existing anxiety cannot seem to cope with it and I cannot unclench my muscles and am in so much pain.

All advice appreciated. 😅 And yes, I am currently trying to seek help. I have no health insurance and have been practically begging the state insurance people to call me back for weeks, lol"

193qt1g,Anxiety,2024-01-11,Hand Sweating,"Hi guys,

So I wasn’t sure if this should be in r/hyperhidrosis or r/anxiety but whenever i’m not doing something that is keeping my mind focused, my hands sweat. Whenever i’m not doing anything that like completely occupies my brain, I think about my hands sweating.  It’s not like dripping sweat like I hear most people with hyperhidrosis get, just my hands get very moist and gross. It’s super embarrassing, especially in school and my social life has been not so great because of this, and I think it’s starting to make me depressed. It’s almost constant in my life, even when i’m trying to relax. The only things that seem to stop it are taking a cold shower or washing my hands (especially in cold water) or sometimes after I go to the gym. Even then it only helps for a little while. I’ve tried some antiperspirant stuff and even baking soda at night. It makes it a little better but not much. Wondering what solutions you might have, I haven’t gone to the doctors yet but I would not be opposed.

Thank you so much."
193qp2b,Anxiety,2024-01-11,Obsessing over every single physical sensation!,"Like everyone I get natural stomach pain, excess gas, occasional reflux, sometimes feeling a pill as it goes down my throat, things that everyone experiences naturally however, when these things happen, I tend to fixate on the sensation causing me to go into overblown panic!

Like the other day I had minor stomach pain, went to the bathroom and then, because I was anxious about other things, it became a full on bout: multiple trips to the bathroom and I even threw up once.

Another time I was taking a Tylenol (which is not the biggest pill) and I felt it go down, it triggered dysphagia and went into panic vomiting etc.

And recently the doctor told me I had some tightness in my chest and prescribed a short term inhaler (it may be due to allergies) and it caused me to hyper fixate. I never felt the tightness before but after the doctor mentioned it, I felt it!

Currently I’m on an SSRI, 10mg of Escitalopram, I’m wondering if I should talk to my doctor about increasing it or try and find a therapist (hard to come by here in Canada it seems :/)"
193qogg,Anxiety,2024-01-11,My anxiety is slowing me down heavily.,"I (23M) have always dealt with anxiety my entire life, I used to not want to leave my mother in my elementary days, during middle school didn’t really have a hard time with it. In High School, I had a bad episode it lasted about month a half of heavy anxiety every single day to the point where I couldn’t even step outside, would sleep about 3 hours a night. Fortunately I overcame it. 

My current situation now is, I’m a father of a 2 year old, I currently had a really rough patch with her mother and we split for about 4 months. All of that has now caused my anxiety to go crazy, Im an electrician helper in the industrial field, so I usually have to travel and work states or 4-9 hours away from home (better money). The main problem i’m facing is, I cannot for the life of me leave home now, mentally. I’ve received so many job offers with great pay out of state and I just cant do it, my anxiety kicks in so hard and I overthink way too much, my main worry is not being able to sleep, I suffer from insomnia too. I went to Mississippi for a job 3 months ago (alone, I usually always had my daughter and gf travel with me) and I didn’t even last a complete 2 days because my anxiety kicked in and I could not sleep, went a full 48 hours without sleep. I’m at the point where I havent had a job for about 3 months now, my savings is slowly draining, I just wish I could really get rid of this."
193qgaz,Anxiety,2024-01-11,"Stress induced nausea, lost 9lbs in a week. Any tips on gaining my sense of being human again?","I often get nausea related to anxiety and stress but i've never had it this bad before. However a really unfortunate thing just happened in my life. There was a lead up to the event, knowing something bad may happen. The event was Tuesday, yesterday. Starting last week I was becoming really anxious about Tuesday and the nausea got worse and worse over the weekend. By Saturday I had pretty much completely stopped eating. Because every time I eat, I get an immediate feeling that i'm going to vomit. This mixed with an almost recovered fear of vomiting has made the stress insanely hard to deal with. It's not just a little nausea, it's mouth watering, hot flashes, I could vomit any moment type of nausea. And it lasts hours. 

I'm in this vicious cycle of being starving, eating and then wanting to vomit for hours until i'm hungry again. The nausea is so intense that I've just been choosing to sit in hunger for as long as I can bare before I finally force myself to eat a few saltines. Which is basically what my diet has consisted of since Saturday. Various types of crackers, water and Pedialyte. I did a regular weighing of myself about 1.5 weeks ago and I was 112lbs, my normal. I was looking in the mirror yesterday and just felt I looked slimmer, so i weighed myself and i'm at 103lbs today. No vomiting at all, just can't eat. 

I figured after Tuesday passed that it would get less intense. Tuesday didn't go as bad as it could have but it didn't go great either. So there's still a lot of stress and anxiety related to what's happening. I finally caved and took zofran this morning (the side effects are often not worth taking it) and I feel a tad better today but not much really. It's 7pm and all i've eaten is a handful of Ritz and saltines. 

My therapist recommended I do some yoga targeted at the vagus nerve which I plan to try in a bit. I've been keeping a playlist of calming music playing, lots of deep breaths but again, just still feel like garbage. I truly don't think this is anything physical/medically happening as I don't have any other symptoms, no fever or anything else to be concerned about. I am just miserable. On top of dealing with the life event, not sleeping well, now not eating, having 2 young kids.. I am just a mess and want to not feel like a zombie."

Well I went threw about a week of straight terror feeling almost non stop. Kept stressing about my health and everything felt unreal. Well it finally cleared up but i would still get symptoms but it came back about a month later hard. My jugular vein feels like it about to pop out my neck, I get dizzy randomly for like a second when a thought pops into my head, my heart beats really hard A LOT now. I keep thinking about my dad dying and what ima do, keep thinking about how things aren’t real and questioning religion does anxiety just start like this for people, my dad has it bad  But I’m not mentally “anxious” about situations just my health gets it going bad when I think about it. Like I’ll walk up the stairs and my heart will be pounding and it’ll lead to me thinking I have heart disease etc etc Idk what triggered it but since I was a little kid I was a hypochondriac. Like my hands felt weak and weird elier when I tried moving them. Took me 20 mins convince my self it was from being out in the cold for a while which it was.

I have been getting 8.5-9 hrs of sleep per night, yet by 2 pm I am utterly knocked out and can hardly function, making it hard to complete my work.

A couple of days ago I was home with a friend. It’s important to we were the only two home. We’re in the living room watching tv and I wanted to take a quick Power Nap before running an errand. I got up and went to the bathroom to pee. I noticed my robe hung in the bathroom and upon checking realized my vibrator was in one of the pockets. When I was done peeing, I took my robe out the bathroom and just threw it on a chair in the hallway. Laid down, took my nap &amp; got up ran the quick errand. When i returned I was like okay I should move my robe from where I had it at. I did just that. Moved it to my room with my stuff. I didn’t actually check to see if my vibrator was in the pocket still. Fast forward later that night, I want to m********* &amp; I’m looking for my vibrator and of course the first place I check is my robes pocket…it’s not there. It’s not where I left it at in the chair, I’ve damn near rearranged everything right there. It’s not at the second place I left it with all my other stuff &amp; now my question is…where tf is my vibrator. I’m losing my mind because I don’t and can not see a reason for my friend to take MY vibrator like that’s tooooo low down &amp; dirty to put past her but I just don’t know what to think. It’s big enough to where if it would’ve fell I would’ve heard it but then again even if it fell, if it’s not touched it wouldn’t move. It doesn’t have legs. So where is my vibrator. Is there a spirit f*cking with me or is there a weird chance my friend stole my vibrator ? 🫠

&amp;#x200B;

So long story short I signed up for online coaching with a fitness influencer who is really lovely, paid the first monthly fee, and then realised it wasn't for me because mentally I wasn't in the right place / had impulsively made the decision and regreted it. 

I then explained this to her and eventually asked for my spot to be replaced and for a partial refund. She had already done my exercise and nutrition plan etc. so she agreed to a partial refund only. She seemed upset that I'd become overwhelmed and triggered by the concept of having a coach track my calories etc. even though I assured her it was nothing she had done wrong! We have both suffered from EDs (hers a long time ago which led her to become a trainer) but I just didn't realise mine was still affecting how I react to calories etc - but she probably thinks she has triggered me. 

I then saw on her story a post she had made about crying on the train and an inspirational quote about getting through your bad days, which I think is about me because it was at the exact time of our conversation and she said she'd process the refund later because she was travelling. 

I feel so incredibly guilty for making this person cry who I don't know well. I feel awful."

193o31u,Anxiety,2024-01-11,Never Experienced Anxiety Like This Before,"So a little bit of background: I've had some degree of anxiety for as long as I can remember. For years my anxiety was around sleep and would manifest in insomnia, but through a lot of work, i'm happy to say i've been able to get past the underlying cause of that. Unfortunately, that has just changed my anxiety from anxiety about sleep to anxiety about my health.

Over the holiday period I had a fair bit of anxiety because an old health issue had flared up again, but over the last week or so, everything was back on track and have actually been feeling great. For the first time in a while, nothing for me to feel anxious about.   
Yet the other day, i'm driving home from the gym, I stop at traffic lights, and suddenly there is this ""rush"" feeling in my body, like this energy and heat is rising from my chest. It feels like there is something really wrong in my body and my brain is desperately trying to stop it. Scary stuff. After a bit of googling, I realise that this is probably a panic attack (never had one before).

I was kind of confused by this, because I genuinely didn't feel anxious, i'd had a really good day. Anyway, what has been particularly strange is that every night since then, i've had a smaller version of that almost constantly while i'm trying to sleep. I'll get to sleep, then wake up feeling hot and my mind racing through a million different thoughts, restless all over. But unlike a typical panic attack (as i understand them), this feeling just stays there, all night. Waking me up every few hours. Outwardly I feel calm, i'm not worried about anything, it's all internal.

I've had anything like this  before even when I used to have sleep anxiety. I guess I just wanted to vent because it's something new for me. But feel free to let me know if you've experienced anything similar! "

I hate the naive part of me that is like a retarded child constantly making mistakes, I want to tear that part away from me and watch it die in agony. I'm so afraid of making mistakes, I don't understand why I even try to do something right! There will always be someone who will do it better and replace me, I am just wasting resources that someone else could use better. Now I'm so stressed that I can't breathe, my stomach hurts and everything is itchy and I just want to disappear. The point is that I did something stupid when I was 14, and my parents keep reminding me of it in a cruelly degrading way, they keep questioning my feelings and things that are important to me. I read books? According to them, I read crap, I pretend to be someone I'm not and it's not important at all. I want to choose my religion? I'm stupid and deluded, ABSOLUTELY NOW I MUST read some article about atheism being better etc. I want to date a friend? He's bad for me, I have no right to do this. I'm 21 years old and it happens every day, there's even a fight about the wrong color of my sweater. And if I even admit that I made a mistake, I am reminded of it in an accusatory, offended tone at least a dozen times. My mother once even shouted that I should cry when I did something wrong, because I didn't seem to feel bad about it. I'm not crying but I feel like I'm going crazy, I don't know who I am. I'm so afraid that I would agree with anyone who is smarter than they would think I was wrong."

193lts4,Anxiety,2024-01-10,What.,"Hi everyone,I posted abt my anxiety on the anxiety help subreddit before and I wanted to write about my experience of getting “help”..
Basically,I’m 15 years old so I rely on my parents for anything like therapy,mental health etc so when I finally had the courage to explain to my mom abt my anxiety she said “oh I know a therapist who can help”,witch I was like “great,I’ll finally get this sorted”.So after school yesterday (Tuesday) we head off for this “therapy” appointment,the appointment starts normal,the girl is nice and she just asks basic questions abt my anxiety,what triggers it etc but then she starts mentioning hypnosis…
I was immediately so confused and a little hurt my mom never mentioned this too me but I didn’t say anything because i didn’t want too come off as rude,so basically she starts doing this guided mediation and is telling me too visualises and I can’t visualise for the life of me and she just keeps going on and on abt how I’m in hypnosis despite me being wide awake and I literally just stopped listening half way through because my ass was hurting and I had was bored but she wasn’t saying anything important if that makes sense,just talking for the sake of talking,then after like 2 hours she told me too “wake up” despite me just faking it the entire time and then she started acting like I was cured.
So after I tell my mam what happened (she had done this before) and I told her that I don’t think it worked at all,so my mam starts getting all offended and saying “oh it takes a few days to starts working” but I know in my heart and soul that it’s not going too work because I literally had a panic attack over having to get in the shower this evening,though when I told her she kind of just shrugged it off
I think now that I went too miss hypnosis lady she assumed that my anxiety is cured now and she doesn’t really care,like I love her too bits but I want her to care,I told her this evening that i was still anxious and all she said was “your just tired” witch I’m not and then yesterday when I left the appointment she goes to me “I don’t want you texting me in school anymore” because during the day I had been telling her I felt like I was going too throw up so now I feel like I shouldn’t mention any anxiety too her anymore because it pisses her off.
I’m so frustrated"

Im 19 years old and I have a strong family history of mental health issues. Bipolar, anxiety, and depression mostly. About a year ago I noticed that I was getting dizzy, shakey, and this almost confused feeling at work. At first, I thought I had hypoglycemia, but a few months ago I started to think I may actually be experiencing panic attacks. I’ve noticed that for the most part, they happen in public. I start to get dizzy, shakey, and hot in public. i’ve tested that it’s not hypoglycemia by eating and testing my blood sugar before I go out and it’s fine, yet I still start experiencing these feelings in public. I don’t think I have social aniexty because I have no problem talking to new people in public, I actually love meeting and talking to new people. I think it may just be the overstimulation? I don’t know, what do you guys think? I want to go to the doctor and get on medication, but I honestly can’t afford it right now, so i’m just looking for advice on how to cope until i can get on some medication. Thank you! 🤎"

-tension headaches 
-stomach aches 
-back pain
-shoulder pain 
-shortness of breath 
-heart palpitations
-blurry/circles in my vision?
-my left arm go numb sometimes 
-my entire body go numb/weak

My head and shoulder started hurting. My body started aching again. I’m currently lying down and the shar pains aren’t going away. I just feel sick all the time. I’m also dissociating a lot. I’m not really present in reality at all these days. Didn’t even know what day of the week it was today.

Is this just from stress/anxiety? If so, are there ways I can manage the physical pain?"

My husband has been my rock during all of this and helps calm me down or listens to me. I was crying to him today and he just looked a little tired of me. He never acts annoyed but I understand how exhausting this all is for him too. I can’t help my health anxiety but I hate that that’s what almost all our conversations have been lately. I imagine having to calm someone down every night and help them can be repetitive but I can’t just keep my anxiety inside. I hate feeling like I’m burdening him
193jod1,Anxiety,2024-01-10,I dont know what to do,"I am an IB student in the first year. Mock exams (midterms) are coming up and it is very stressful time. I struggle from stress, lack of sleep and trouble with concentration. Besides of studying I also think a lot about my future. I have no idea what am I going to do after I graduate. I am not even sure if I will ba able to graduate. I am surrounded by people who have visions, plans, know who they wanna be and most importantly are motivated. I dont even know who am I right now.  
  
For a while I thought I was going to study business in college. Than I decided for psychology. But I am not even sure if I wanna go to college. But I have to, I would be nothing only with graduation. That is the pressure from my parents. My dad is a doctor and my brother is going to be one as well. I dont know what I wanna do. Once I am so passionate about some dream that I come up with, but in a while a forget about it. This keeps going for quite some time now. It is very frustrating not knowing what is coming and what to expect.  
  
I dont wanna study. I dont wanna dedicate my life to one purpose. I dont wanna lock myself in an office, lab or anything like that. But I want my life to have sense. I want to create and enjoy my life. But dont know where to start. The pressure from the society is too much to take. I try to tell myself that if I try hard enough a can make this little dream of mine come true. That I am going to come up with a way how to work on my own without the need to be pinned to one place. How to make money to help my mom leave her current job a find a better one she is going to enjoy.  
  
I know that probably everyone has been in the same situation at some point and that I am probably overreacting. But it just feels like to much to take in. I am 18 and feel like there is no way out but work my butt of for something I dont even wanna do. I have already spend so many days and nights googling ideas how to get out of this stereotype but so far no success for me. Its not like I dont wanna work hard and put effort into what I do, but I need to know that it is worth it and that Im not going to regret it.  
  
Im really sorry if this does not make sense but I just write what comes to my mind and am not planning on checking it because I could change my mind about posting. Also Im sorry about any possible misspells or grammar errors.  
  
This evening has probably been the last drop. I needed to express my struggle and emotions as I have never talked about this with anyone. I am not a person who is able to talk about their emotions in person. Thank you all who finished this and would appreciate any advice, peace of support or just ensure that I am not the only one with such feelings."
193jg0x,Anxiety,2024-01-10,How to stop ruminating and catastrophizing the small stuff?,"There was a period of very heavy rains where I live, and my recently renewed roof developed a few small leaks, none of which seem to have a straightforward fix. 

It has been challenging trying to find a solution and the process has dragged on a bit, but for some reason this has really taken me for a loop.

While I know it's not a big deal, I can't stop thinking about the problem and it takes my mind in all sorts of tangents, like:

- How I'll never find a solution, how this will cause irreparable long term damage, how this will affect eventually being able to sell my apartment one day and the financial implications of that 
- My own abilities and competence (like being thorough in assessing the house, choosing roofers to fix my roof, how I deal with roofers to fix these problems)

While rationally I know my response is disproportionate to the problem, I feel like I can't 'resume' my life until the problem is fixed, which isn't a good response.

It also makes me worry how I might respond to something that might happen in life that really matters, rather than mundane home maintenance.

I’m a senior in hs and earlier today I accidentally backed into a car in the parking lot. Initially, I drove off because I was so freaked. Then I thought it over and realized I should leave a note even though there was no one in the parking lot and no cameras. I left a note with my name and number but since I’m so young I’m terrified the person is going to want to go through insurance and it will drive up my premium. My parents pay my insurance so I’m terrified they’ll be mad or upset.

193ipbz,Anxiety,2024-01-10,Chronic Anxiety Since 2018 and Health,"I’ve wanted to make this post for a while now. Being one who has struggled with their health anxiety as more or less the main culprit of their anxiety struggles since 2018, it is hindered me from doing so. There are real and important benefits of talking to actual healthcare professionals, and to my best ability I’ve done so in extensive pursuit lately. However, despite this, I can’t shake a couple of things that are truly bothering me and I need some reassurance— whether in the form of someone else who may have a similar experience, or confirmation of my anxieties, etc.

Here is some background. Please bear the long explanations here and feel free to skim…

 Health and mortality have always troubled me. I remember struggling with these concepts even long before I was self-aware that I dealt with this mental illness. As things progressed, and the ability to Google symptoms came about, these anxieties reinforced themselves deeply into my psyche. Now I’m nearing the end of my college career at the age of 21 feeling just as hopeless as I did then, though now with much more responsibilities, less lifelines and much more tired. My health anxiety had been so-so in comparison to where it would eventually lead me at the start of college. This past summer even it wasn’t nearly as burdensome. Now, my daily physical sensations and anxieties about them have been amplified to an unbearable level.

Around September, I got a pretty rough case of Rhinovirus. My girlfriend took me to the ER (unfortunately a scratch of that hypochondriac compulsion to do so) and they took my blood, told me I was sick, and gave me a $1500 bill. Yet at the time I felt absolutely in dire condition. This feeling of being in “dire condition” has persisted since I got sick then, though has manifested in numerous different ways. My panic disorder got so debilitating that after this I was hardly able to get myself to class driving in the morning without needing to pull over. Then, my anxiety heavily latched onto the choking near-death experience I had back in April of 2023, and rendered me in pure fear of trying to eat solid foods. All while my chronic chest pains and palpitations that I’ve had for years continue to drum along. Of course, I got a lot of these things checked out. I had a holter monitor on in 2022 for a week, three EKGs done through 2022 - 2023, various blood work, a barium swallow test, new medications, etc. Yet, I still feel trapped by my very painful and debilitating pains I feel every day. These pains aren’t just chest pains either. I get strange stabbing pains in my head at different spots, my extremities get very sore, including also my back, sides, legs, and even jaw and wrists.

Anyway, I say all of this to say that I just feel utterly trapped by these physical sensations and by my body. When I’m not experiencing them, I feel a hundred times more at peace. However, they’re so frequent, painful and intrusive that I’m not sure where to go health-wise. Right now my main concern is with my GERD. I was diagnosed with it at a young age. At times in my youth it was deeply troubling and painful. Now, eating is made difficult with the pains I get, constant burping, regurgitations, and such. I’m just concerned that my GI has something seriously wrong and that checking it out will reinforce my anxieties and amplify my pains more."

I had a test today, my final exam, i was caught trying to cheat or more like they are still suspecting me for cheating. I was finished with my test but intentionally didn't submit the test. I planned to get out of class early and fix some lf my wrong answers outside because the test was done on google form. unfortunately for me, one of the proctor actually timed it when people submit their form and leave the classroom. 

So after i left the class i went to the toilet and did the rest of my test there. After that, i opened up my phone and realized the proctor was actually calling my phone for the last 5 minutes. I was scared as fuck, so i went back to the class and tried to give an explanation. I said that i was having stomach problem and had to get out of class rightaway. and by pure clumsiness i forgot to submit the gform inside the classroom. She said that she will report it to the professors and let them handle it. 

For the last 12 hours I've been going crazy out of my mind trying to give myself a reasonable explanation for my behavior to the professors IN CASE they are questioning me later. I have thought of dozens of different outcomes and the worst outcome keep coming to my head. I dont want to get expelled. I am not a dumb student, but i know i am lazy as I've always given the lowest effort possible. I am now sitting on my toilet regretting my decision. I'm not trying to get sympathy, i just need people to hear me because i don't think i can handle it. my head is dizzy and my stomach are hurting so bad."

193hv5z,Anxiety,2024-01-10,Can’t cope with anxiety of uncertainty need advice.,"Hello everyone. Hope you all are being able to manage your anxiety very well. I need your help/advice to fight my anxiety. Please read along.

I have been an anxious person and a pessimist all my life mostly due to health reasons. Like when I was 16, I was anxious about the way my nose looked. Then when I turned 23 I got bout of severe anxiety about my hair loss which lingered for about 2 years. Then last year in the fall, I went into another episode of serious anxiety when one day I suddenly started having spells of dizziness lasting whole day when I was awake and continued to happen for about 3 weeks straight. Within that time I also started to experience slight left hand weakness(like difficulty in lifting something) and tremors for the first time which made my anxiety extremely high. The weakness subsided after a month but I for the peace of my mind asked doctor(GP) for brain and spine MRI just to rule out anything serious. Brain MRI was ok but cervical and lumbar spine came back with mild disc bulging issues. This was a bit of a relief but over a  month past that I started having slight numbness in my hands, feet and face and also tremors continued to happen, all this primarily on my left side which made me rush to a neurologist who is a specialist in movement disorders as well. He checked my hand movement and also tremors and diagnosed me with health anxiety and prescribed venalfaxine and propranolol. Then after a few days upon some random googling and forum reading, I came across Parkinsons Disease. Athough I did not have symptoms like rest tremor and slowness, my mind fell into the trap of over analysing and I started to become even more anxious. This happened for about 2 more months till I came across a forum about AL* which sky rocketed my anxiety even more and made me relate AL* symptoms with my past 4 months old symptoms of hand weakness. I don’t have clinical weakness, cramps or regular twitching but now even random muscle fatigue makes me super anxious very quickly. I need help in trying to think positive for once as I feel dead inside and do not enjoy anything anymore due to uncertainty of some serious illness. How do I find hope and positivity? I have tried CBT for 2 months but it didn’t help."
193hqhe,Anxiety,2024-01-10,Tremors or anxiety amplified heart beats?,"Hey everyone,

I have been having some odd symptoms which I think are amplified by good ole consulting Dr Google. My issues started about a week ago, where every time that I would fall asleep, I would be awakened by what I would call a shake or vibration in my back. This of course led me down the Google rabbit hole of do I have MS, Parkinsons, etc.

Over the course of the last 3 days, this has blown up to full blown panic attacks and lots of over thinking and other symptoms. As of now, my symptoms are the same thing of falling asleep with the vibration feeling in my back, whole body tingling, general feeling of being unwell, and the weirdest one - whole body “tremors”. 

The only weird thing with these so called tremors, is that I feel I may be getting them confused with my heart rate and anxiety making it worse. The “tremors” can be felt in my neck, back, arms, and hands, all at the same frequency which makes me think it may be my heart rate? The only thing is, my actual heart rate can be around 90BPM, where as the feeling I get in my neck, back, and arms feel more like it’s at a 140BPM. The other weird thing is, when I check my pulse with my fingers on my wrist and focus on that heart rate, the fast tremors I feel other places align with the heart rate I feel on my wrist.

Does anyone know if it’s possible that the anxiety, general shakiness, and panic attacks are making the regular heart rates feel super fast and intense, almost as if they were a tremor? The fact that I feel the fast shakiness in a bunch of different places makes me point more towards amplified heart rate and anxiety versus an actual singular tremor that I feel at the same frequency throughout almost my entire body. This is my first time dealing with actual full blown anxiety and panic attacks, besides general medical anxiety, so I am hoping to get this figured out.

Any thoughts would be much appreciated. Thanks everyone!"

My life is over.
Also I've had sleep paralysis 6 times roughly in past 6months. I moved to uni which was scary transition but I dread sleep alot now due to it. I'm scared I will die in it, will go mental, will never sleep again, will stop breathing, hallunicate, will become paralysed when awake and moving, narcoelpse....the list goes on. When trying to sleep I meditate and listen to relaxing music, I don't eat before, I exercise in day, drink enough but till get it. I am very anxious w sleep tho. I get scared I'll either mever sleep due to overthinking which causes me to stay up and have panic attack or I'll be scared of overthinking and think I'll have sleep patais as I'm still too uous for sleep and I'll be stuck. Last night I randomly got SO. I just hate ur and I'm scared I'll see stuff and I'll dread sleep so much. How to I reduce SP? How do I reduce anxiety. I have constant anxiety alot and have had body sensations and just overthink so much. I'm scared I'll become paralyzed when I'm not sleeping smwhch is horrible.

I went from Prozac to Wellbutrin with Buspar and I just feel so unmotivated and like I don’t care about anything. I find it very hard to find the motivation to even go to the gym which is normally my happy place. I also got laid off recently and am finding it incredibly difficult to even look for a new job and get my finances in order.

Pre-medication I feel like I had a ton of drive and ambition and a willingness to work and be fast paced and now I’m incredibly sluggish. I feel like being on nothing, staying consistent with therapy and working out would be more helpful at this point as long as I have my drive back. My lack of drive is also causing me financial issues and the impulsivity too. They say I have anxiety then they say I have ADHD. I feel like nobody knows anything. The psychiatrist literally reads notes from a book and rattles off side effects when prescribing me meds lol."
193gj6w,Anxiety,2024-01-10,New here,"Hey everyone I (29M) am somewhere on the “high-functioning” end of the autism spectrum and one of the comorbidities with that for me is severe crippling anxiety influenced by OCD. I used to have severe depression but after having that treated with TMS therapy, ironically enough my anxiety seems to have taken center stage. I have never felt what they call “constructive anxiety”, (yes school was pure hell) I can’t compartmentalize it and it floods every fiber of my being, and it seems to be getting worse with each passing year. The things I struggle with mainly are issued relating to politics, world affairs, climate, dating and romance, anything with the word school attached to it, and extreme weather forecasts, the last one being especially hard for me since I’m a gardener and my plants are my life. I have tried all the different coping mechanisms that people have recommended and none of them have really worked, and when I have attacks they end up becoming my family’s problem, luckily they are supportive and understanding but I still feel bad burdening them with it. I don't really tell my friends the full breadth of what I deal with and only allude to my struggle in conversation without giving too much detail, so they don't really know what happens to my mind and body behind closed doors, though it can sometimes show on my face so I'm asked a lot if something's wrong. At this point I would say even my baseline mood is slightly anxious and feeling actually at ease is kind of rare for me, even though I don't experience the severe crippling depression like I used to, and I should add that sometimes I fantasize about never being anxious again and just having numbness and blankness where that feeling is supposed to go, because anything would be better. I guess I'm hoping to find an understanding and supportive community of people who deal with similar stuff as me and hopefully we can help each other get through our toughest bouts somehow, because ultimately it’s only us who truly understand."

This caused me to go into a deep and horrendous anxiety-episode which has lasted for over a week now in which I have been almost constantly anxious about this stupid right temple.

Now I rationally know that nothing really changed (Actually had the same anxiety attack about a year ago) but in the back of my head there's this almost neurotic conviction that something did change and that I'm about to lose my hair. 

Managed to make some progress in combating this Anxiety Episode but still can't quite overcome this feeling of dread/fear.

Anyways, despite the minor time differences. (The max being 3 hours for two of my friends) They're always sleeping or about to fall asleep when I'm up and panicking. Which SUCKS for me.

i haven't had any issues with anxiety in the past few months - in fact i did reaaally really well most of 2023 and went very optimistic into 2024

sadly, i tested positive on the 1st of January and am on my 9th day now

i had a couple of other symptoms like exhaustion, coughing, sneezing and tinnuts - but strangely enough also a whole load of anxiety

not anxiety about covid or my health - but rather a general sense of impending doom, like loosing it all, having fucked up my life etc.

has anybody else experienced this with Covid? how can i calm my nerves?

The first couple weeks were fine but then I started to get really bad anxiety being home. I started having a like sinking feeling or like falling feeling that I’ve never felt before. I started thinking irrational thoughts like the world is falling or just weird thoughts like that. Time also started moving very slow again. Sometimes I feel like I can’t grip myself onto anything anymore. After coming back to school I thought it would help my anxiety but it didn’t. I can’t even sit in my hour long class without my mind going crazy with thoughts. I am going to see a therapist thru the school next week but in the mean time, what are good ways you guys would cope.

As long as a feel “healthy” my anxiety is ok.  But I unfortunately do have health issues including  benign PVCs (heart palpitations where it feels like your heart skips a beat) as well as IBS and GERD, and any time one of my health issues flares up so does my anxiety. 

But ultimately it comes down to me being scared of dying and I don’t know how to get over that.  And honestly it feels like such a dumb problem to have. It feels like everyone else just walks around not thinking about it and I think about it daily.  Why?  I can’t control it.  I’m just so sick of it and tired of feeling this way.

193acy1,Anxiety,2024-01-10,New here and dealing with this buildup of anxiety for trip coming up,"So I just joined this group and felt bad venting about anxiety related stuff in another group for Bipolar disorder since it’s not really a space for that even though others have no issue venting about it. I wanted to ask someone who does deal with GAD (mine is on a severe side as I does affect my life decisions and prevents myself from doing things that could be fun).

I am weird about flying on planes. Even though I have been on a plane before and I have been fine in the past, I have a reoccurring fear of being in a plane crash. But strangely this isn’t the fear that is most consuming this time. It’s leaving my cats behind (I still live at home-I am an adult in college) and my family being responsible to care for them. This last year 2 cats (I have 3) have been attacked twice by the same dog we have in our house. We have gates up and everything so the dog cannot get to them now, however, the 2 cats got attacked the second time most recently in this past November and lucky didn’t need to go to the ER this time but still got punctured wounds that are still healing. One cat had to get a shot cause he got an abscess. The first time both got attacked on separate occasions, I wasn’t home and was at a friends. I was guilty and upset with myself because mom wasn’t around to comfort them. After my anxiety calmed down after months, I managed to be ok to leave the house to stay the night at friends again. Then in November, again on 2 separate occasions, both same cats got attacked and I was home but was asleep and woke up both times. 

My grandmother requested me to come care for her after her surgery and I leave this weekend (out of state). I’ll be gone for a week for now because I’m not sure how long I’ll stand to be away from my cats before I start having nervous break downs. The hypothetical scenarios are just constantly crossing my mind and the 2 I’ve narrowed down are them being attacked and them being so depressed that I’m gone. I am home all the time so even though in the past they have been left at home (other people are there) and I have come back, I still feel guilty leaving them. Like I’m a bad pet parent. 

How the hell am I supposed to do this? I am currently having a mild anxiety attack and I’m on my work break trying to forget about this so I can focus. I don’t know how to self soothe myself that it’ll be ok and that I cannot keep letting this prevent me from living my life."

Teeth clenching, Gum problem, Wisdom tooth, Swollen lymph nodes, One side neck so tense. Hard time breathing. Tension headaches. On off knee pain and now my balls feel uncomfortable from time to time.

I had my lymph nodes checked yesterday ENT said it was because of my gum problem and probably my wisdom. And the tension on my neck is probably how I sleep. I had the same thing checked last Aug. 

Today I had my eyes checked ran some tests and it was normal. Doctor gave me some eye drops.

the thing worrying me now is my knee pain and my balls feeling uncomfortable from time to time. Dont know if I’m just thinking about it so much.

I also feel like I have a lot of privileges in life, that should make things “easier” per-say. I even have days when my brain feels like I’m not stressed, but my body does. I get tension headaches, extreme fatigue. My doctor says I’m fine, no blood work was extremely out of ordinary. The only conclusion I can come to is that I am not cut out for modern society and life. Sometimes all I think about is escaping somewhere rural or a forest and getting rid of my smart phone. My therapist said that seems extreme, and like I’m just trying run away. But I’m just so tired of not feeling good every day, and all the stress I feel from life. I want to try out living somewhere rural and away from modern society and on my own, but of course I have some anxiety about that all too. Idk, am I crazy or does anyone else feel this way?"
1938rri,Anxiety,2024-01-10,Anxiety or stomach issues?,"Hello everyone! I, F(23), suspect I could have a hernia or something else wrong with me. Otherwise it could just be my anxiety.. I do have an appointment with my psychiatrist on Monday to see where to go from here but would like some opinions and maybe options of what it could be. 

I have been on medication for anxiety and depression since I was 14. I’ve been in wellbutrin 300mg and Nuvigil 150mg for about 2 years. I was taken of exsira 100mg about 3 months ago and then given Trazadone 50mg to take instead to aid in sleep too. Since around that time period or just there after I started getting quite bad symptoms with my stomach. I have always had a sensitive stomach so thought this would subside after settling but it hasn’t. My symptoms are getting worse and it’s just unpleasant. No - I am not pregnant. Ive taken multiple pregnancy tests (8) over the last few months and they’re all negative/say not pregnant - my period is regular too and I have an IUD. My symptoms are the following: 

- Consistent nausea - some days are fine and I don’t feel sick at all; others I can’t even get out of bed or leave the toilet because I am Vomiting or just so nauseas. 
-No appetite most days
- I am having reflux - it’s feel like cold/warm and chunky coming up my chest sometimes
-Shortness of breath some days 
-Going between runny stomach, constipation and no bowl movements
-And the weirdest and latest is like a fluttering/pulse in my stomach. It’s the weirdest feeling and I don’t know how to describe it other than something is pulsating around my stomach.
-I’ve also lost 10kgs and now weight 58kgs and am 172cm. 

Please advise and give suggestions. Thank you in advance."

193895q,Anxiety,2024-01-10,Help! Is this anxiety?,"I’m writing here for some advise from people who live with anxiety, after having been told by more than 5 doctors that I have anxiety but I’m just not convinced. So, I have an elevated heart rate, tingling in my head and shortness of breath AT ALL TIMES, especially when I wake up in the middle of the night, or just lil bit of exertion like bending, or eating food. I’m scared it could be a heart/lung/ neurological issue. My assumption is that such symptoms should show up ONLY when one is having a panic attack and not all the time even when mentally one is feeling calm? I’m just not sure if this is anxiety and so I haven’t started taking the meds prescribed by doctor. I got some blood work and heart tested , and doc says it’s all good. But I’d really like to know if anyone else feels the same way all the time or is it only me?

1937uy7,Anxiety,2024-01-10,"How do we feel about health tracking apps, specifically heart health apps.","I’ve had health anxiety for as long as I can remember. Though I’ve been able to manage it somewhat as I’ve gotten older, it’s still there. For most of my twenties I used alcohol and drugs as a way to distract my brain until I started notice its toll on me. So I quit all that jazz a few years back. Most recently stopping using weed a few months back bc I just felt bogged down and felt it was making my anxiety worse. I’ve always eaten really clean (contradictory to the drugs lol) and have been exercising for I’d say the last 6mo or so regularly. 

Would you all say that you find these health apps useful or detrimental? I’ve been monitoring my heart rate and hrv to track my progress and recovery and have generally found some info useful. However I recently got a reading saying I was in poor health (even though heart rate, stress and energy were great) and it’s got me freaking. Starting to wonder if I should not use those apps and just track what info my watch tracks without the third party apps. Any insight is appreciated"
1937orz,Anxiety,2024-01-10,Can't stop comparing myself to other more socially successful people. HELPP!! Tips?,"So, I have been recently comparing myself to other more socially successful people which has caused me intense and excessive anxiety. 

I can't study properly without this thoughts intervening in my head every 3 minutes. 

I don't consider I have a shitty social life. I have a few groups of friends here and there and I love them. We hang out whenever we can, go out or maybe stay in to watch movies or drink and gossip.

However, I still compare myself to other people. Specially people who aren't that social now but were back in their young times. Like my mother or aunties or father even. I know they lived in another time where people used to leave their homes more often and hang out in bars all together. Now these days people like to stay at home more, connect through social media and maybe get a drink or two 1 a week or not that often.

I know there is people a bit older than me that do go out every day. Like my mother used to do. But I don't and I compare myself with those people and I am terribly upset because of it. I realize that maybe I am not that sociable and extroverted as those people. Maybe I was not designed to follow that way of life. But it seems that everyone around me does in my family and I feel like a loner because of that. Even though I do have friends.

I do want people to see that I have friends and I want to stop comparing myself to those people. How do I stop this and be comfortable with what I got. I won't be happy until I am."
1937nn4,Anxiety,2024-01-10,Has anyone felt this?,"Sorry in advance for the long post…

So for a bit of background in early December I had a horrible panic attack while taking a shower and since then I’ve struggled. After the initial panic attack I was fine for a few days then had another small one, it was so weird because I don’t normally have random panic attacks. I’ve suffered from anxiety for as long as I can remember (24 now) but they’ve always had some sort of trigger (storms, loud noises, too many people). So after that I spoke to my GP and she gave me 10mgs of Prozac which was awful I had horrible side effects (increased anxiety, loss of appetite, sleep issues, feeling like I couldn’t breathe, heart palpitations, derealization, depression, weakness, and crying fits) I stuck it out for 3 weeks before she switched me to Wellbutrin which was even worse before taking me off medication completely. 

Now I’ve been off all medication for about a week and I feel a little bit better. I can leave the house again for short periods of time and I’m slowly getting back into my normal routine, but now I’m faced with another problem that I’m not sure where it’s coming from. I can eat again and do light activities but I constantly feel fatigued, dizzy, sometimes confused, easily agitated, my throat feels tight and I feel like I’m not breathing properly, and I experience derealization from time to time. Besides that I’m sleeping better and feeling more like myself. My GP said it’s just anxiety not I’m tired of hearing everything is “just anxiety”. Maybe I’m worrying too much but has anyone else felt like this? It’s making me nervous which probably isn’t helping. Thank you for making it to the end and any help or advice would be greatly appreciated 🩷"

I heard this year there will be a solar storm that's gonna fuck everything up. I pointed out there have been solar storm warnings around this time of year for the past few years and people told me that this time it will be bad and we're all probably gonna die. I heard it's gonna knock out all wifi which would activate all nukes and it would knock out all power and we heavily rely on wifi and electricity to live. I'm too scared to research it more because I'm scared it's completely true and I'm gonna find something I don't wanna find. I find it weird I've only heard about it on tiktok, but I don't wanna go searching for it more if it is true. I don't know what to do. I'm scared.

1937cy0,Anxiety,2024-01-10,I beat social anxiety disorder,"Hi, 
This is weird to write but i think its important for me and anyone who might be reading this to hear.
Ive always been prone to anxiety, however around a decade ago I experienced multiple life events that lead me to having SAD - Social Anxiety Disorder. Although I was a happy, energized and extroverted kid I slowly fell into deep depression from my inability to present it (SAD controlled my life)

Years after, i was in a better environment which made me open up a bit more. It wasnt perfect, strangers still actively gave me panic attacks and people still considered me a snob for being too silent however it was the best i knew, and the best I thought it was going to get.

That was until 2 years ago, when my whole world turned upsidedown- I had to meet a lot of new people in a short span of time, speak up for myself, show emotions and seek help from strangers. My GAD (Generalised Anxiety Disorder) was at an all-time high, thats when i was finally went to get a diagnosis and medication.

I showed up to a new environment again, a good one. I now had my psycologist, medication and a fresh start.
I tried my best to ""be the one in control"" as people loved telling me- it never really worked..
However with enough good experiences i started craving social interaction instead of fearing it. I did things that made me feel good like helping a stranger on the street. Those positive interactions gave me motivation, i wanted more, even needed more!
Even simple goodmornings (that i said) in the morning started my day with a smile! In previous years i was always so quiet, that whenever i did speak i would have to clear my throat because it wasnt used for actual hours.


Today im okay, today  i try go embarrasse myself and it never WORKS
I no longer care about what people think about me and im just out here enjoying life.
It feels unreal, but it is. If you reached this far i hope this story gave you hope for a better future :)"

19376y7,Anxiety,2024-01-10,Holding Space for Anxiety,"Lately I have been trying to shift my focus away from questioning why I have anxiety (either in the moment or as a general statement) and suppressing it, towards holding space for my anxiety by acknowledging that it’s okay for it to exist, that I don’t need to hide parts of myself to “fit in”. I have been reading some anxiety-focused self-help books and working with my therapist on how to safely hold space for anxiety without having it take over my daily life. So far, it has been liberating to take the pressure off of myself to not be anxious because it’s unrealistic for me. I now go into most situations expecting to be anxious and trying to be okay with it instead of telling myself “you better not be anxious”.

For those of you who have engaged with this practice, what methods did you find helpful in holding space for anxiety in your life? I also completely acknowledge that not everyone is comfortable with this or willing/able to do this and that’s okay!"
19371ur,Anxiety,2024-01-10,Is it possible for anxiety to manifest in unexpected ways?,"Last year (Sept.-Late Dec.) I had a terrible bout of  existential anxiety. I would think of death daily and had the usual symptoms (shoulder and back aches, strain on my neck, pinching chest, bouts of depression). Since then, I feel like Ive been doing a lot better.

But even after feeling okay, these early days of January (about the death stuff at least), a new problem has arisen. I feel like saliva has been pooling in my mouth, there are abunch of times when I feel hungry even after eating 3 full meals a day (dunno if its related to the saliva thing), constantly gassy (burps and toots), and sometimes I sweat quite a bit (unsure if its from worrying or its a symptom of something else). Should I be worried and contact a gut doctor or is this just me being paranoid as hell? Has anybody had something similar? What can I do about it or do you have any advice to give?"

I have had high BP due to my health anxiety.  Or who knows what it is caused by!!!!!   At its wore when having a panic attacked my BP was 198/154!!!!  I went to the ER for that....then it calmed to 150/100 and then eventually got normal readings after a week or so....at its best it is 103/63 (when all is good and I am calm).  I have worn a 24 hour monitor to check and it was fine....but cant help but wonder how my BP can just shoot up so high.

My latest health anxiety is I have had pain in a tooth when I chew something hard.  I had an xray last year and nothing came up.  I have seen the dentist a few times for cleanings, check ups and mentioned the tooth issue.  They checked etc and she thinks its probably a tiny crack that can not be seen (this also came up in my research).  But you want to know what else came up in my research.....BRAIN TUMOR!  Apparently something a tumor can cause freaking pain in the tooth or jaw.  ARGGGHHHHH.

I have an entire list of crazy health worries and diseases I thought I had - leukemia, diabetes (even though bloods were fine!), kidney disease, thryoid disease etc....the list goes on.  But my latest worry because of this tooth issue is so annoying.  Its not like I am imagining the pain when I chew somehting hard in one tooth.  I pray it is just a crack that cannot be seen."

I ve been diagnosed with severe depression, anxiety and borderline personality disorder, I used to take 8 a day meds (that didn t helped even just a little) and go to therapy, but have to stop both cause i didn t allow those no more cause I m broke.  
  
Even if rationally I know I will be okay if I send a CV or go to a interview, I can t to that, I m that scared that i will watch an website of jobs and after 5 hours I will not be able to click the send a cv button. I don t know how to explain it to you guys, I can t imagine myself doing these things. At first i tought is only the anxiety, but my then pshychiatrist told me that with all the therapy and meds i should ve be able to calm and little bit and be able to go to an interview, and she thinks now this is paranoia and dellusions not anxiety alone. It s so frustrating becuase i never met someone in my life experiencing this thing, I just can t send a cv and imagine myself going to an interview, im morbidly scared, even If i try to manage my symptops with dbt from a workbook or trying to break the paranoia thinking into rational thinking in my journal, finding all the proof I can do this, I didn t, even when I was on xanxax or other benzo, 2-3 pills a day, i couldn t put myself together.  
  
I never managed to finish college cause of pandemy and my mental health.

Next on Saturday we are organising a bigger dinner for the closest family, around 15 people in total, because it is more in my comfort zone - to schedule that after the big day, when emotions will go away and I prepare mentally to participate.

And here it starts. 

Our parents are offended that we invited them only for the big dinner to celebrate, but not for the 15-minutes ceremony 2 days earlier. I have a solid public speaking anxiety, hate when whole attention is focused on me and don’t want to ruin my wedding with that feeling. Also we are not close with the parents - we live far from each other, meet only on birthdays or some special occasions which happen maybe 6 times per year? We do not trust them and can’t really relay on in case of the emergency, there is no really a bond between us. They are not giving us money or anything in regards with the marriage. And of course I cannot tell them that I have anxiety in front of my family - this is totally beyond of their understanding.

Coming to the point - because of their reaction now I feel guilty. Even though I know that their presence would ruin my wedding day…"

It has come to a point where I get really bad anxiety even if they're just on the same floor and I actively avoid being around them when they're together. It feels like I'm walking on eggshells around them. The slightest breath can send them into a frenzy of shouting. 
And when they do argue, my anxiety gets so bad that I find it hard to breathe. My lungs won't expand and I can't get full breaths of air. The worst part is that I freeze up. My body won't move so I just sit there, forced to listen to everything. 
Over time I've developed a coping technique (which really isn't the best). Whenever they start arguing I just go on my phone and try my best to ignore them. This technique barely helps but I don't know what else to do. Besides, I've been unable to do things that I'm supposed to be doing (like studying) just because I'm curled up in a corner with crippling anxiety and my phone.

It is insane to me that the people in my life are actually in my life and not just people I think up(including family, friends, etc.) It gives me anxiety thinking about literally anything and everything, even more so at night but it is relevant in the day. 

I feel dissociated practically 24/7.  I don’t even know if I’m depressed anymore. I know I used to be every single day and I genuinely don’t remember if I have been recently. 

My anxiety is not crippling, though. I normally just say “fuck it we ball, I’ll deal with anxiety” to activities that will give me anxiety. Even to those things that shouldn’t give anxiety.

I talk to no one, I have no friends, I just sit, read, play chess, build legos, workout, and that’s fucking it. I’m nothing and a nobody and will be remembered not. I’ve had only a single serious girlfriend and have only got laid once. I have done a lot of drugs. I’m the most mundane person you will meet. I try to fly under the radar so people won’t notice me because I’m crippled by anxiety. I feel everyday I’m losing my grip on reality slowly everyday feels like I’m reborn  in the worst way possible.

1931hrk,Anxiety,2024-01-10,I don't know how to keep growing and live for my future.,"I don't know how to keep growing and live for my future.

I (20m) need help figuring out how to move forward in my life. I'm graduating College next year and don't know what I want to do with my life or even how to do something with my life. I've always struggled co-existing with other people throught my life, I was diagnosed with clinical depression and high-functioning Autism a few years back and I've never in my 20 years had someone I could call a friend. I still don't have my license due to a fear of driving and haven't been able to hold a job long at all. I'm crippled by my extreme social anxiety and can't even hold conversations with others consistently. Therapy the past few years has helped, but nothing has really changed in my life and my anxiety seems to be getting worse.

I'm realizing now as I sit here that I will be a college graduate in a year, one who should be well adjusted and ready to join the workforce and start a career, and yet I've never had a first kiss, a best friend, still can't drive, and am terrified of extended human interraction. I feel lost and don't know what to do. Most nights I end up staring at walls just wondering what will become of me while staving off panic attacks. I'm not depressed enough to ""attempt"", I'm just scared and sad I think. I'm not really expecting any solutions here, but maybe I'm not alone, maybe someone can relate to what I'm feeling."
1931d39,Anxiety,2024-01-10,How am I supposed to live?,"I don’t know how I’m supposed to live. I’m 18 and almost never leave the house. I’ve been in therapy since I was about 12. Year after year both my depression and anxiety got worse and worse. It’s gotten to a point where I’m scared to go out in public. You kinda of HAVE to do that in order to be a functioning adult. 

If I go to a store I hyperventilate, burn up, and get super shakey and dizzy. I’ll have to hide in the bathroom until my mom is done shopping. Once I went on a date where I was going to take him to a sushi restaurant he wanted to go to. I walked in and was so nervous. It was packed. We went upstairs to see if there was any room up there but the second I saw how many people there were I just froze. He turned back at me wondering why I wasn’t following him and I tried smiling and playing it off but I was already crying. I was so shakey and hyperventilating I couldn’t stand. I had to sit in the hallway for a bit to stop crying and get my breathing back to normal. 

Sometimes I’ll feel okay in public. But I’d have to both want and choose to go. I’d probably have a panic attack for a half an hour or so, but eventually my body adjusts and I can just have fun. That’s VERY rare though. 

I can’t even hold a job. If looking at a restaurant is enough to break me, the month I spent working destroyed me. I don’t think I can ever be the same again. The people there had shunned and bullied me. I’m searching for remote jobs but it’s so hard. 

If I can’t get a job or money I’ll never be able to move out. I don’t know what I’m supposed to do or where to go from here. I feel so trapped. It’s like I’m suffocating. I can’t find a way out of this mess."

1930ssn,Anxiety,2024-01-10,"New job, impostor syndrome and anxious all the time","Hi. Just started a new job in a professional environment. My boss and coworkers are all very nice and helpful. But I have had impostor syndrome since before I started.

In grad school I knew I was capable of doing this job, but unlike most of my classmates I was the first in my family to attend college, let alone grad school. Everything was new to me, but my classmates seemed to know everything and be familiar with all the etiquette and terminology. In this time I developed severe impostor syndrome—even though I knew I was smart enough to understand the concepts, figure things out or otherwise, I thought that one day, I’d make a few mistakes or so in the workplace and be “discovered” that I’m actually a fraud and can’t do it. Almost like I would’ve been lying to myself that I could do it.

In my profession, my job is known to be coveted. It’s temporary, but usually reserved only for people who have exemple my academic credentials. I didn’t end up having stellar credentials. I went to a good school and placed around median, but the other people who got this job tended to be near the top of the class and almost reliably from families of professionals.

Since stating this job, I’ve continued to have impostor syndrome. I constantly am anxious about getting fired for the slightest errors or because I’m still adjusting to how things are done. I also feel like if I say “I don’t know” in response to my boss’s question, even if it would be the truth, I would be found out to be a fraud. This leads me to try to guess the answer as though I know it confidently. When my boss asks follow-ups, I get flustered and eventually change my mind after looking into it further, and the boss ends up more confused because of my inconsistent premature responses. I’m trying to get used to how my boss asks questions, but I know some of the problem comes from within me.

Do you all have any advice or experience dealing with impostor syndrome? How do I teach myself that I’m qualified and am allowed to make mistakes/not know something? My coworkers/boss tell me I’m qualified and just need to stop being so nervous and anxious. I want to gain my confidence back."

I build an amazing physique these 2 years all the while having great genetics being 6'2, i took pride in being an amazingly strong individual and thought none of these ""losers"" could step on me and that i am better than all of them, but alot of people were extremely jealous of me and started picking on me, i managed to fend of the weak ones but then someone came that wasnt scared of me and actually wanted to fight me.... there i realised how fucking weak and trash i am because i was actually scared of physically fighting him even tho there was a 100% chance of beating him.... i gather like 10 dudes and go at the guys workplace to scare him,
he got scared but didnt apologize... then someone lies to my friend that he has guns and shit, so i decide to go with my uncle the next day and we solve things with the guy (poor guy was just scared) and he ends up respecting me... but then a ""loser goofy short dude"" ( thats what i thought of these people on my mind, comes along ) i was playing voleyball with my class and he comes to bother us and throw insults, i stand for the class but we dont really heat the conversation, later a small situation happens in which i almost was about to get into a fight with him (didnt talk just gestures)
Some days later i was outside the school and notice something which started my anxiety...
The dude i was about to fight was about to have a fight of like 25 people vs 25 people and was perfectly calm.... i realise then that if i had gotten into that fight i would have crumbled and it would show me how truly weak i was because they would have beaten me since i would fall under the pressure.. since then i am in extremly down mood because i feel so weak theres a constant pressure in my chest because i have opened my eyes to how weak i am to these trash that do nothing but talk to each other all day, i realise that if i make one mistake and piss of one of these wannabe ganster trash lowlifes they will gather their groups and pressure me and i will fall under the pressure  because i have no experience in fightings...
I cant live with being weaker than everybody and keep thinking about it all day, weirdly at times i regain all my confidence and feel like i can beat them all but i know that the anxiety which makes me feel weak will come back everyday, i feel inferior to these dogs that act tough and do nothing all day because they have groups and can beat me at school. I have been testing myself and actually interfered in the game of the guy with 25 dudes which right now is probably the strongest at school but its not only about him i want to be stronger than everybody and fail under no pressure or my life has no light, its killing me inside why i am like this and so mentally messed up and have been trying to find god but i have basiclly 0 belif"
196lc6a,Anxiety,2024-01-14,Depression/anxiety becoming too much to handle anymore and I’m scared for myself.g,"
Hi there, 

I’ve been struggling with depression and anxiety for quite some time and I use to be able to control it. I needed help because I was borderline suicidal with uncontrollable panic attacks and was admitted into a mental hospital for 2 and a half weeks without being able to go outside or sleep a full night without someone coming into to my room to shine a flashlight on me to basically make sure I wasn’t killing myself.  This was a few years ago now but I fear the experience somehow made things worse. I was experimented on with many different kinds of anti depressants at a high dosage and none of them seemed to work. Now I’m back to where I was before. I don’t have much of a family or friends  because of the sad situation of their own alcoholism and outright evil things they’ve said and done to me both mental and physical. Some of the things are almost unspeakable and literally makes me just start crying because I can’t fathom the love I had for them and the things that were said to me and it feels like an unbearable pain. The saving grace I have is my amazing fiance, I love her so much but I can never give her the full love I want to because my heart just doesn’t know how to love anymore and I feel like just a complete empty shell of a person. Part of me wants her to just leave me and find someone new and more successful that she can be happy with. Another part of me is scared for myself, I just want her to be happy and I’m getting closer to just taking myself outve the equation completely and finally ridding myself of this pain and planet I feel I have zero connection to at all. I’ve never felt more alone than in these times and have completely lost all human connection, and as a 35 year old man… no one cares."

196jzhg,Anxiety,2024-01-14,Anxious for business trip,"I'm facing a dilemma about an upcoming meeting in two days that requires me to take two flights. In the past (before COVID), despite my nervousness, I frequently flew without much issues. However, I haven’t been as anxious as I am now before this trip. My anxiety worsens by my IBD and IBS, which I am afraid could complicate both the flight, my time during the meeting and the two nights there.

The meeting was initially cancelled, but last week, I was noticed that it is happening anyway. It's a hybrid meeting, allowing for both in-person and online participation, with half of the attendees being there physically.

Given my anxiety and the potential effect it can have on my health, I'm leaning towards canceling the flight and attending the meeting virtually. I'm thinking I should maybe take it slow by first taking a shorter flight to visit family as a way to prepare for longer journeys.

Should I cancel and take it slower? I am afraid I should feel guilty doing so.. Thanks for your support and advice."

Anyone have advice?

At least I think it's anxiety. 

When I'm depressed I can still do stuff I'd just have low energy and maybe question motivations. Anxiety definitely more on the hyper side of it mentally but it feels like there is no motivation. 

Sure there's a lot of energy but it due to stress, and maybe way too much energy or bad energy. 
Sometimes I can't even calm myself down. It also feels like my head gets migraines as well and I feel like I can't sit still.

I avoid people during this because I find I lash out.

When I was 18 I got some help, spent some time in a psych ward, got a BPD diagnosis (now I suspect they misdiagnosed me, most of my behavior and thought processes are in line with autism, but it's still just a suspicion), I got on antidepressants and antipsychotics both of which I stopped on my own since they were causing me a lot of trouble, but I have not been suicidal for a while which I consider major progress and I can say that I've never been more mentally stable, but in contrast with how I was mentally stable for me might not be what it is for most people. Currently my anxiety just keeps increasing and it is ruining my life. I'm unable to attend my classes because if I do within 20 minutes I'll feel an anxiety attack coming and all the physical symptoms I'm gonna get into soon, and I just have to get up and go (that causes me a lot of anxiety as well, getting up in a full room and leaving, it draws attention and it makes me want to bash my head in). My relationship is causing me tremendous anxiety as well, I recently broke up with my bf and took him back quite soon, I knew it was a mistake then and I feel the consequences now but I can't leave again right now, I just have to figure out the next steps. The physical symptoms started few days ago, it was my birthday which is absolutely the most depressing day of the year surrounded by a whole bunch of trauma, because, you know body keeps the score, and it's the first time I had a panic attack in a while, I genuinely thought I was dying and having a heart attack. Since then, those symptoms keep persisting throughout the day. I've had some of them leading up to the panic attack, but now it keeps increasing. Random stabbing chest and abdomen pains, fast heart rate while I'm resting, heart palpitations, throat tightness, face numbness, muscle weakness, especially in my legs, shaking, hot and cold flushes, eye twitches and blurry vision and so much fucking lightheadedness and dissociation - it makes me absolutely miserable and impairs my ability to do anything, as well as increasing my health anxiety, making me think I have 20 different illnesses. How do I get rid of these symptoms, it seems quite hopeless, I absolutely can't afford going to a therapist, I've contacted free counselling clinics but they're all full, and all the therapists I had before let me go because I was too complicated for them and they couldn't help me. I've cut down on caffeine and consider starting meditating more regularly, right now I just smoke weed all the time because it calms me down and helps with my pain but I'm starting to rely on that too much and need a better alternative.

Practical worries are the situations you can solve and move forward from, hypothetical worries are the situations that you can’t change the outcome of, meaning it’s out of your control and you should try to let the worry go. 

I’m finding those lines are becoming blurred when I look at the state of the world these days. Every night I go to bed with a sense of crushing existential dread, and it doesn’t seem practical or hypothetical. I can’t do anything to change it, but it’s definitely there and happening right now. It’s so prevalent and real that it feels like I have to do something but there’s nothing I can do at the same time. Look at the wars, climate change, the cost of living, the increase in violence between people, the poverty, the hate. I just don’t know where to put that worry anymore. I’m terrified of the news, I turn it off whenever I hear it. I am holding my daughter whilst she sleeps and all I can do is cry because I don’t know what her future looks like, I feel like I can’t even guarantee my own.

Nothing on the weekends.

**Focusing:**  According to Harvard Health, focusing on anxiety symptoms can make them worse. The more you focus on them, the more alarmed you become, and the more intense your symptoms become. 

**Accepting:** According to Harvard Health, focusing on anxiety can make it worse. When you focus on anxiety, it can become more intense and alarm you, making it difficult to do much more than worry. 

**Fighting:** According to a Harvard psychologist, fighting anxiety can make it worse. Psychological research has shown that avoiding anxiety through distractions can make it worse over time. 

**Avoiding:** According to psychological research, avoiding anxiety can make it worse in the long run. This is because avoidance can trap you in rumination, which can create more stress and anxiety. 

**Medicating:** Although this sounds contradictory, anxiety medication does have the potential to create more anxiety in some cases. Sometimes, you may experience these side effects in the first week of taking the medication. They tend to subside as you adjust to the medication.

These ""solutions"" are also brought up by doctors, mentors, therapists, weirdos, friends, family, and strangers on the Internet. ""Just do X, Y, Z."" Contradictory, and none of it works.

194qv53,Anxiety,2024-01-12,"Pseudodysphagia, Severe Anxiety, Weight Loss","I am 20 years old and I have severe anxiety.

I was diagnosed with severe anxiety when I was 11 years old. I had issues with eating - feeling like was always going to choke on everything. I felt like I could feel every single little grain that went down my throat. I was feeling tingly throughout my whole body, very dizzy, I would shake uncontrollably and dry heave. This anxiety disorder just randomly hit me out of nowhere. I was in out of hospital on ivs because I wouldn't eat. I basically lived on protein breakfast shakes. I was very underweight. I was prescribed Prozac, I took it until I was 15. Since I had an issue with eating.. I wouldn't take pills so my medication was in liquid form.

4 years later (15yo)... I stopped taking the prozac because I started to feel better and thought I wouldn't need medication anymore. I was okay for a little bit but my anxiety came back within a year of being off of it. I was put back on Prozac and my dosage was increased. I took the medication again for 2 years but stopped at 17 because i had a tolerance to Prozac. By this time, my eating had gotten a lot better and I was able to gain my weight back (145 b) so my doctor and I decided I would be okay without my medication.

After I stopped taking my medication (17yo), I thought I had been gaining weight because I was eating good again but I went back to the doctor and I was diagnosed with hypothyroidism.
Hypothyroidism is basically where your thyroid doesn't produce enough hormones and you gain a lot of weight. I was prescribed Levothyroxine which is a pill but I am able to crush it. I am not able to get off of this medication because it helps regulate my thyroid. The only downside to this medication, is that I can't gain weight when I am on it. So the (145 lb ) went down to (120lb).

Last year, I gave birth to my daughter and she is exclusively breastfed. Since have been pregnant with her and after giving birth, I have been the same weight (95lb). I am 5'0 for those that need that info.

Recently, I started to feel really bad again. I started freaking out about choking and I would wake up in the middle of the night sweating and my heart pounding randomly. I would get really nauseous &amp; feel like I was burning up. I go through spells where a burp will feel like something random is lodged in my throat. I have also been diagnosed with GERD which is basically a really bad heartburn disorder. I take Omperazole for this which is a great help. But my doctor has mentioned that GERD is a factor of why I feel things in my throat - the acid or gas can sit in my throat and my anxiety makes me think I am choking.

I have been taking lexapro for about 5 months now and it has helped me so much but I am still struggling a little bit with the whole eating thing.

It's very hard for me to stay on track with my meds which I know understand is my own fault. I have been trying to gain weight for the past 2 years but nothing seems to help.

Please give me any advice or suggestions.
Anything will be greatly appreciated. Please do not comment rude things but I also don't want things sugar coated. Thanks in advance!"
194q5ug,Anxiety,2024-01-12,Anxiety back after a long time /new symptoms,"I haven’t had this bad health anxiety since 2021 after my father passing but now it’s come back since November 10 and now it’s peaked 

I started getting new symptoms, like chest tightness, shortness of breathe , dizzy, gagging/dry heaving like throwing up, Weird heart thud or loud heart idk.

And when I’m relaxed it feels like my body is “vibrating” or floating.

But does anyone get this? Even randomly? It’s the worst causes me to spiral I’m 27M
I’ve gotten heart workouts like EKGs, heart monitors for a week and ECGs X rays and blood tests back in 2021 and 2022 and stress test and everything was good. But these new symptoms make me so nervous I had to quit my job. Especially the random chest tightness and shortness of breathe then feeling like I need to throw up is so scary. I also been having bad GERD and indigestion lately and IBS like symptoms . I take omerpazole and tums daily. Someone please what should I do?"
194edw6,Anxiety,2024-01-11,Anxiety about investing/money in general,"Hi, 

I’ve been having anxiety lately over not knowing how to allocate my money properly to hopefully make more money. I have a car loan that I thought I would pay off earlier than the loan term, but after talking to my dad and brother who are pretty good at investing, they don’t think it’s a good idea because a car is a depreciating asset. They think it would be smarter to invest into like my Roth IRA due to the better returns. I do value their opinion a lot but I also like to get rid of debt as soon as I can. I also want to open up a High Yield savings account to earn more interest but I’m kind of nervous to move the savings amount that I have just in case there’s an issue in the transferring process. Does anyone have any suggestions on what I should do? I just want to be as smart as I can with my money with not a lot of risk either though. 

Thank you"

193jufx,Anxiety,2024-01-10,terrible school anxiety and homesickness,"hi everyone. i’m currently going into my second semester of sophomore year at college, and i feel terrible. i’m coming back from winter break, which i spent at home with my mom and dad who live in a different state. i am very close with my parents—they are my best friends and an amazing support system. i have really great friends at school, i get great grades, i have a therapist, and i’m on medication. i try to do everything right, but no matter what, i can’t seem to get better. every time i come back to school after break, i hate it. it is genuinely the worst feeling in the world, which makes me feel silly because i don’t have a lot of “real world” problems. i’m very blessed but i’m still incredibly unhappy because my mind is a cesspool. 

i know that i hate coming back to school because school is my number one anxiety trigger, and my biggest support system (my parents) is 2000 miles away. i try everything to get better, but the transition is so hard. i love being home because my parents are the only people i feel i can be myself with, plus i don’t have to stress myself out so terribly over school work. it is genuinely my happiest.

i want to be an adult. i want to be a grown up who can go to college and have a good time and live away from my family but it’s SO hard. my mental health is just killing me. i know the semester will eventually get better, but i hate this feeling so much, even if it’s temporary. and even when it does get better, i’m still not as happy as i want to be. 

i don’t know what to do. i am going to my dream school, and it’s a great one. i have friends here that i love. i want to grow more. but i also want to leave so bad. but then i think about how unsuccessful i would be if i left and transferred to a less prestigious school closer to home, and i think about how people will judge me and how i will be excluded from my friends here. it feels like there’s no right answer.

sorry for rambling—this is my first time actually asking for advice here. i’ve wanted to but was too scared, now im thinking, what do i have to lose? any advice is appreciated—what i should do, possible ways to improve my shitty brain. thank you in advance!!"

193aiqs,Anxiety,2024-01-10,Physical Only Anxiety (Any help is appreciated) 19M 190LB,"I am a 19M and I’ve had anxiety since I was probably 10. I’ve never had any racing thoughts or freaked out in my mind during anxiety. My chest feels funny, I guess you could say it’s tight but there’s almost never any pain. It’s such a weird feeling it makes me want to clutch my chest or put pressure with my hand as if I am pledging allegiance to the flag. Much recently I have been experiencing a lump in my throat that makes me gag every time I am presented with a situation such as a job interview or something along those lines. It’s beginning to debilitate me because as the anxiety worsens and turns into a panic attack(been diagnosed with panic disorder) the gagging gets so bad that I will throw up. The gagging happens every morning which I theorize is due to natural high levels of cortisol in the morning and when I am driving to a stressful situation. I have had to pull over to throw up multiple times.

I’ve been to an internal medicine doctor and all they recommended was peppermint because it relaxes the throat, i’ve tried with varying degrees of success.

Basically I’m asking if anyone here has had any similar experiences and If they have found a fix without going on any serious meds."
1932dgk,Anxiety,2024-01-10,anxiety waiting for cardiologist appointment,"Hi everyone! i hope youre well. For the past year ive struggled with the worst heart anxiety after my granparents passed from heart attacks. Tachycardia pain impending doom ive had it all. Im only 20 im a healthy weight although i dont exersise and have no health issues. My parebts always stress so much when i get anxiety attacks too and that just makes it worse. 

  
On friday i started getting chest pains and went to the hospital. They thought it was pleurisy but had me check in w my doctor. She doesnt think its pleurisy, i think it was an anxiety attcak cuz ive gotten pain with anxiety before but tbf this time it was extreme nothing that ive felt before. My tropnin and ddimer were perfect and my ecg was makred for sinus arrythmia, ive also had 2other ecgs in the past and a 72 hour holtor moniter which were also clear. 

  
My doctor is reffering me to a cardiologist to make sure nothing is wrong and that is making my anxiety so much worse but she said it could be 3/4 weeks before i hear for them to make an appointment. The fact that she thinks something could be wrong is stressing me out so much ive been crying ever since i got home. The waiting along with the possibility of smth acc being wrong i feel so helpless right now. I was also getting such bad anxiety all last night and all day about the appointment and now i keep convinvg myself it was omen a bad one. 

  
If anyone has any stories about sucessful cardiologist trips or ways to cope and reassure myself right now i would be so grateful. Im so exhausted im only 20 this is no way to live anxiety has left me as a shell of the person i used to be and that is literally one of the shittiest feelings ever. "

Sometimes it’s in my the pressure travels to my nose? The side of my nose? I feel a throbbing/twitching there, my teeth and in my eyes too ???????? And then it goes back to my head again. It’s mostly in my sinus (middle of my eyebrows). Sometimes at the back of my head and it’s frustrating. I have twitches in my body too, spasms, shakes and such. 
Palpitations and I can sometimes feel my heart beating. Head pains in random locations. Pain random parts of bodies, burning sensation (mostly in legs) I also developed visual snow and it’s litany of symptoms. I feel disoriented and unbalanced because of whatever the hell im feeling. I’ve visited 3 ophthalmologists/optometrist, an internist (for my diagnostics, blood test came back NORMAL), and recently a neurologist. She says it’s anxiety and I’m on day 3 of sertraline 25 mg now. And I still feel my symptoms it’s so frustrating. I feel like I have dpdr too and nothing feels real :( I haven’t felt normal in ages. This has been going on for over a month now. I spent the holidays feeling the WORST. I didn’t expect my life would be like this. I’ve developed HA too. When does this nightmare end :( I’m planning on getting a CT soon and I hope it pushes through. I’m scared of having a brain tumor/brain cancer/brain cyst/MS/ALS or any other scary neurological disease. And if I get diagnosed with something bad, I wouldn’t know how to deal with it. I’m only 17 and I’m barely 18 yet. I still have a life to live and I can’t believe I’ll spend the remainder of my life feeling terrible terrible and awful. I’ve still got hopes and dreams :( On top of that I’m thinking of the hospital bills we’ll accumulate. We’ve already spent a fortune on doctor visits (I live in the PH, no insurance). And the mental and financial strain, well experience if I get diagnosed with something terrible. I feel so lost and I can’t endure this any longer."

I stupidly decided, while painting a closet, to have no ventilation whatsoever. (This took around 2-3 hours) Of course being in a closet made the situation worse as it’s super enclosed. After a while the fumes got to me and I felt super dizzy and just “off”. The dizziness made me come to my senses and realize the mistake I was making so I opened all the windows and stepped outside for a bit until I was feeling better. I don’t feel dizzy anymore, but I do have a headache presumably from stressing over it. I’m a major hypochondriac and hella paranoid about everything. Am I going to be alright?

I’ve since then had non stop symptoms such as a tight chest, tight throat, lightheaded and dizzy, always tired, heart palpitations that seem to never go away, loss of appetite, you name it. I have been seen by doctors and cardiologists, who’ve done blood, ekg, 2 echos, x rays, a holter monitor, and currently on a wait list for a mri… only thing found was LAFB which they consider benign… I constantly think I destroyed my heart with what happened and even with doctors telling me I’m okay I still think I’m not and continue to get these symptoms, I can’t even drive myself to work in the mornings… what’re your experiences?

Last July, a huge fire broke out in the apartment diagonal to mine, causing zero damage (thankfully) to my apartment but completely destroying the apartment of the person who accidentally lit the fire. After that day, I have been smelling phantom smoke. I open a window (like I did that day) and will randomly smell fire smoke and start to panic and get ready to run downstairs.

I think I’m gonna go get checked out at the hospital but I need to vent first. So I’ve been having really strong Deja Vu for a while now. Sometimes it hits me and feels like I have lived that single moment a hundred times over. I always had a theory that it was memories from a life I lived before or something more than mental, but one day I had a really strong episode and a date popped into my head. February 14th. Idk why but I had a feeling that was the day I would die. Idk how or why, but I keep getting strong Deja vu, and then frequent weaker Deja vu, like all the time. I feel like I’m crazy and now that the date approaches I keep thinking that I’ll have more and more memories of the moments before I die.

I had similar symptoms in September and went to the doctor to get checked out but turns out I was all fine. I think I was just very anxious waiting for some standardized test results to come back to me in September and my symptoms were a physical manifestation of that. 

The thing is, right now I don’t feel very anxious mentally, but all the physical symptoms are there. It’s like there’s some sort of disconnect in my brain and body that’s keeping me in fight or flight mode. Wondering if anyone else has felt like this and how they treated it? I’ve been meditating and that helps a bit but I still am struggling to breathe and relax my heart rate as a perfectly healthy individual. I am a bit stressed waiting for my grad school decisions to come out, maybe my body is just way more stressed than my mind? 

If anyone else has experienced this, please send tips!"

I’m not really sure whats going on with me, the past 5 days my anxiety has been making me feel so scared to be alone. the thing that seems to be triggering it lately is spending time with a specific friend, we will spend hours playing games and when he leaves i feel this pain in my chest, i start crying and have an anxiety attack because i don’t want him to go. i have no romantic feelings for him or anything, just an attachment. i feel crazy because i only met him a couple weeks ago and i have no reason to feel like this. i don’t know what to do, these sudden panic attacks and being afraid to be alone started a few months ago after a breakup and my psychiatrist gave me Lorazepam because i couldn’t eat or sleep, and i only take it when my anxiety is uncontrolled like right now. the random panic attacks stopped for a little over a month, and now this person seems to be a trigger for me in a way. i have so many things to do but i can’t focus on anything. i don’t have many friends and i was really happy to meet someone that i enjoyed spending time with but now i’m dealing with this. i’ll be seeing my psychiatrist again in 3 weeks but if anyone has any advice for me until then, that would be super appreciated."

I understand now that this likely stems from things like percieved societal expectations and comparisons, but that doesn't stop me from dwelling on it!

Its nonsensical because it's something we have no control over and ultimately doesn't matter, plus i'm actually still really young in the grand scheme of things, but wow i hope i don't have to deal with it every birthday or time i reach an age milestone like 25, 30, 50 etc. I wanna enjoy my life and not focus on age but i can't help but feel insecure for not reaching certain marks in life soon enough, or just generally freaked out that i'm about to be in my mid 20s when it feels like i was 16 only last week.

I'm sure someone else on this sub knows what i mean."

He told me not to too much but I’m still kinda freaking out. He said I have a 1 in 10 chance if any at all of being at risk of sudden cardiac death or cardiac arrest but it’s still got me concerned. After months of having weird symptoms I’m honestly kinda glad in some ways to maybe finally know whats going on. Im doing an echo on Saturday and a stress test at the end of the month. Im currently lightheaded all the time and tired so much. I can barely eat or go on a walk either. Could really use some support. Best case scenario its Tokotsubos Cardiomyopathy which is completely reversible. On top of all this i’ve been Diagnosed with IBD-Possible Chrons recently as well as a Strep B infection in my blood its all got me a mess lately and my anxiety has been through the roof. Im hoping for some good news in the coming weeks. Until then i’ll try not to let every weird sensation freak me tf out. Best wishes to everyone:)

I’m anxious to go because I don’t want to hear any bad news. I know I shouldn’t have but I googled what high bilirubin levels can indicate &amp; most of the answers scare me.

192yv0t,Anxiety,2024-01-10,What should I do?,"I've been diagnosed with OCD and I know I have maladaptive daydreaming, misophonia, and anxiety. 
Im 28m and I worked somewhere about 7 months ago and I have a stay to myself personality. On top of that I wanted to follow my religion and not unnecessarily talk to the girls or make eye contact/smile. I said hi and bye to everyone all the time even if they didn't say it to me. I would just do the work and clock out. 

That made some most of my coworkers upset. I was a dishwasher in a restaurant. One girl started to be very verbally abusive. When I would come to put the dishes after washing them and the baskets to the front, she would angrily sigh at me and turn her back. She even did that when I said you're welcome after i helped a customer get their uber eats order. When I tried talking to her at the end which I never should have HUGE mistake- never talk to people that are rude to you or ask them for help, try finding it somewhere else- so anyway I asked for her mop to mop the floor because I didn't have one. She let me use it and then as she was going somewhere, I said it's small meaning my area. Her abuse got to me that's why I spoke to her. she literally sighed angrily EVERYTIME I came that night, before she only did it sometimes. Then I was gonna give back her mop because someone gave me one and when I called her, she said what rudely and then just thanked the other boy and mocked me (because I just hi and bye thank you and you're welcome just talk about the work...). I ended up getting fired a week later because my attitude changed after that night.

So fast forward to now, I'm currently not working, my daddy gave me money. I just have some stuff going on that's why. I like to hangout in the Dunkin donuts near my house for hours. I'm definitely not gonna stay home all day! Okay here's the big surprise, that girl walks in for an interview. Before the interview, she saw me and gave me a cute smile. I just looked at her and then looked away. One thing to add is, she was nice to me that night only if we were alone. But when there were people around, she just wanted to humiliate me. She came in again today just to but kiss. The two times she came in, I had an anxiety attack. I'm not scared of her, but I don't know... The first one lasted for hours she was only in there for a few minutes. I had one again today and was even shaking. My chest had those anxious feelings. My eyes looked sad and my eyes got a little teary. Not a lot though it didn't feel like I was gonna cry at all.

If she gets the job, should I find a new hangout spot? I already have one in my mind, but I just really like this one. Or should I stay? Do you guys think this could be a chance to fight and improve my anxiety? Another big thing I want to add is like I said I have OCD and this has actually been my obsession for a while now! Rumination. Just going over it and over it from morning to night and feeling sad."

Usually, if i have the day off when they leave i take a Benadryl and sleep the whole day or until they call me and tell me they’ve gotten to their destination because if i stay awake i will cry until i throw up  and i just can’t live like this anymore- it’s genuinely so exhausting on top of the general anxiety i struggle with everyday.

He has a great job, and he told me if I ever decided I didn’t want to work anymore, that we would be fine and he could support us. Sounds like a dream on my end, right?

Well I feel so guilty. I would never want to put all the pressure on my husband’s shoulders, so I work. I am currently in school to better my future career, so I currently don’t have my dream job at the moment. I’m just pushing through.

I find myself panicking about even the smallest but necessary purchases. I need new clothes, but anything that will last me a long time will cost $40+ dollars. I need my skincare because I ran out, but don’t want to spend nearly $100 at Sephora. I can’t use cheaper stuff because my skin will break out. 

I never ask my husband for money even though he offers it to me every now and then. I never take it. I feel so bad. The only exception is when he gives me money to go grocery shopping for the both of us. Even then I don’t spend every penny he gives me.

I have also been encouraging her to order her own food as she struggles to talk to strangers and this is a basic skill we all need.

I had to get my gallbladder taken out two years ago because it was functioning at a 16% and I was so sick everyday I was losing an unhealthy amount of weight. After I got it out, I was sick all the time. I could barely eat and when I did try to eat foods they upset my stomach. This started my anxiety. I was so scared about leaving the house and not being near a bathroom because I constantly did not feel good. Since then I have gotten a lot of my stomach issues figured out but it still happens at least once a week when I get sick. But the anxiety never left. I was finishing up college dealing with these issues but I missed as many days as I needed when I didn’t feel good. During that time I worked as a doordash driver because of my busy schedule with school. This also allowed me to not have to drive/work when I didn’t feel good. 
After graduation I was having a very hard time finding a job. It took me around 6 months to get my first interview. I got the job as a probation officer and I was excited to finally have more income than I was getting as a part time doordash driver. The night after my first day I had a panic attack and didn’t feel in my right mind for at least a week after. I was already in not so good of a mindset (having anxiety everyday) and decided that maybe a job that stressful was not for me right now. (They told me it would take at least 6 months to get a full grip on the position). That left me without a job and having to move back to my hometown with my parents because I wanted to focus on myself and I knew I couldn’t keep supporting myself doordashing. 
I got an interview right away as a pe teacher at my old middle school. I figured this was the perfect position for me because there’s not too much stress and there’s a lot of time off involved with being a teacher. I had my first day today and started having an anxiety attack at school. I was tempted to go tell the boss I couldn’t do it and I needed to go home but we ended up getting evacuated and let go early anyway. Now I am having so much anxiety and not wanting to go back tomorrow. I know it seems so silly and simple to just go back but in my mind it’s a lot more work than that. It’s leaving my safety at home near a bathroom where I’m free to not feel good. (No one likes not feeling good in public). I guess what I’m trying to figure out, should I stick with the job and hope that my anxiety goes away once I’ve been there for awhile or should I just focus on my mental health and maybe get on disability?"
192xrqz,Anxiety,2024-01-10,Just started meditation,So I (17 M) have suffered with HA/GAD For many years now and it’s just become too much so I made the decision to go to my doctor who has put me into 1 on 1 therapy and put me on sertraline 50MG just wanna know how do people find being on this medication how long does it take to kick in does it stop intrusive thoughts all together does it calm you down what side effects do have when it first starts?

192xpd7,Anxiety,2024-01-10,Heart anxiety?,"So a few months ago I went to the doctors to get a physical. Long story short, I really don’t like my doctor’s office. They’re so unprofessional and known to be scammers or misdiagnosing. Anyways, my friends are nurses and I’m scared of doctors as it is and they gave me the rundown on what to expect at a physical. (Touch your toes, check your eyes, ears, reflexes, etc.) and my doctor did none of that. She just checked my heart with a stethoscope. To add, I have really bad anxiety and I felt my heart beating really fast. So she told me that she heard an extra heartbeat and my heartbeat sounds very abnormal and was asking me if I ever get shortness of breath, chest pains, all that. I told her no. I run for half an hour no problem, I exercise, I eat healthy. She made me do an ekg and the nurse told me she always sense patients to the cardiologist. Ever since, I’ve been having really bad anxiety with my heart. All those symptoms she asked me, I can’t even tell if I feel it or if it’s all in my head. Recently, my friend had checked me with her stethoscope for a good two minutes and she told me she didn’t hear anything unusual nor the third heartbeat the doctor said she heard. But I’m still scared. I don’t know what to think and my anxiety has been really bad ever since. I can’t help but think if something is wrong with me."

192wv1o,Anxiety,2024-01-10,60-50 BPM when sitting/standing/laying down,"18 yo male, skinny and not very active. But lately I've been moving more. Had anxiety since about 6 months and right now my heart rate just sounds too slow. It's mostly in the 50-60 range, had some palpitations throughout the day too where the HR would drop a lot! Whenever I make sudden moves etc, the last 2 days I've had a bit of dizziness/weakness and difficulty breathing (mostly because of stress/anxiety) 
Yet doctors said everything is fine. I've done 6 ekgs in the last months and 2 echos. Everything fine. But this heart rate is not letting me focus on anything. Idk if it's the ""healthy"" bradycardia but I'm not very active! Also this started just the last days. +the classic panic/anxiety symptoms (numbness, difficulty breathing and chest pain) can anybody with experiences help? Thanks"
192wqip,Anxiety,2024-01-10,It’s a cycle 😢,2023 was just an awful year for me.  I have thousands of dollars in medical bills because I think every little ache and pain is something serious.. as soon as I go to multiple doctors and have multiple tests and find out it’s nothing.. I’ll be good for a day or two then a new ache or pain pops up and here goes that vicious cycle again. It’s so exhausting… I don’t have a quality of life. I’m always worried about things I can’t control. I hate it :(
192wkb0,Anxiety,2024-01-10,Anxiety about politics?,"I’m pretty sure that my anxiety related to hearing/knowing anything about politics comes from my troubled childhood but does anyone know how to cope with something so unavoidable?

There’s some situation in a country mine is close to (geographical ofc) and my anxiety is just going up with thoughts about random dangerous situations where I’m harmed. 

I feel my chest closing and I need to do stuff but I never found any mechanism to cope with uncertainty in general. While I understand that there are some activities I can do (and that I will certainly do!) I feel like it should be about time that I start to learn how to cope with uncertainty or just things outside my control, since I usually just give in to “rituals” that would contain it for a bit.

Thanks a lot !"
192wjgv,Anxiety,2024-01-10,I cant stop crying,"I don't know why but I keep crying with no specific reason, just everything makes me want to cry, especially at night. I don't know why this is randomly happening to me as I don't normally struggle with any mental illness. 

I don't know if its because of exhaustion, I haven't gotten much sleep in the past two nights (maybe because I'm technically jet lagged? I just came back from Japan. I have experienced this before after coming back from Asia) 

I hate it and I don't want to cry everywhere like this, I don't know how I'm going to go to school. Help :( I worried its going to persist even after my body adjusts to the timezone."

192w6j5,Anxiety,2024-01-10,Panic /Anxiety back after remission on Sertraline,"45m here. Have had anxiety and panic disorder since the age of 14 (diagnosed). This disorder eventually became exacerbated due to substance abuse throughout my 20s which eventually hit rock bottom, thus leading to my sobriety and seeking out therapy. 

I was prescribed 100mg of Sertraline which virtually cured me of all anxiety related issues. That was around 10 years ago. Just recently I suffered a severe panic attack and have been swimming in full blown anxiety for about a week now. My strongest thesis at this stage that my medication has finally petered out after such a long window of use. - anyone here with the same experience? If so, what have you done going forward? 

My anxiety symptoms / experience is as follows: Initial panic episode which includes excruciating fear, terror, doom, hot flashes around my back, derealization, depersonalization, dizziness, slightly increases heart rate, numbness, gut and stomach issues. After initial episode, I have days or weeks of agoraphobia, severe depression (loss of pleasure in anything), loss of appetite, fatigue, fear, worry and relentless cycle of negative thoughts that all seem to ebb and flow. There seems to be a very long tailwind of the above symptoms after the initial attack that can last indefinitely or become worse with triggers. . 

Can anyone relate to this type of panic disorder? Also medication suddenly not working? And if so, how did you manage or what are your take aways? Would love to discuss."

I have a lot of issues simply having my cycle because I struggle with the principle of having one (that’s another story lol). My issues are, any hormonal bc seems to raise my anxiety. I just started and stopped the nuva ring because of it. Taking hormonal contraception in general gives me anxiety because of the health risks and I’m so anxious about my health. Please anyone out there with any advice ?? I usually do continuous birth control, no placebo or off week. Should I just suck it up and do the off week? Has anyone noticed a drop in anxiety from that?

My heart has been looked over countless times with EKGs, ECGs, Xrays, Echos and even a catheter and they all say my hearts fine. But my brain keeps telling me I'm gonna have a heart attack or a stroke or something.

192vplh,Anxiety,2024-01-10,Not sure if I should see a cardiologist or not,"So I’ve been pretty sedentary for about a year and a half. I was barely getting even 1000 steps daily. I put 30 pounds on in like 4-5 months ( a little concerned about that as well). 

I’m wondering if my heart rate is normal or not. 

So my resting HR is usually anywhere from 70-90. If I’m standing it’s usually 102-108 doesn’t seem to go below 100 (I don’t like that). I’ve recently started waking on my walking pad because I’m trying to lose weight. Walking at a speed of 3 my heart rate can hit 144 and it will stay at that until I stop. If I go a slower speed my heart rate can be like 125ish. 

But my heart rate goes up extremely easy. If I get out of bed it’ll shoot up 30 beats. If I walk up stairs it’ll jump a ton. If I lift heavy things my heart rate can hit as high as 180 (which is extremely uncomfortable). 

I don’t know if this is normal since I’ve been so sedentary or if I should look more into this. I just want to be healthy again and lose weight and live my life. I’m not going to stop exercising because of this, I just want to know if it’s okay for me to exercise and if exercise will help lower my rate. My resting rate seems to be fine, but my standing rate and exercise rate seem to be a little high."

192vfqx,Anxiety,2024-01-10,So I had anxiety without knowing,"For about a year of so I have been feeling a pounding heartbeats almost every day, mostly at night. I was almost certain it's sleep apnea. I did a sleep study and it turned out I'm perfectly fine. Went to my GP to tell him this (haven't seen him in a while). HE WAS 100% CERTAIN I have severe anxiety. He asked ""do you ever have a need to cry?x 'I told him I'm not sure but I do feel empty a lot of the time, especially at work"". He gave me some herb pills now and it did calm me down just a little. Apparently they don't work all the time cause I just woke up now at 2am with again pounding heartbeats.

Any advice? Any lifestyle change? Routines etc.?"
192v92c,Anxiety,2024-01-10,My whole body...stings,"It's like a needling feeling in extremeties and my head just feels like a dull sting, I know that's an oxymoron but it's hard to explain. I know it's anxiety, it's annoying AF. I think it's the cortisol. I'm tapering off of Lexapro so that probably has something to do with it too. It's like gentle needle pokes all over."
192v2ii,Anxiety,2024-01-10,Anxiety and stomach issues are making me depressed,"I had plans to see my boyfriend today, but I had an episode of severe stomach cramps and diarrhoea last night from 1am to 4am. I woke up feeling better, but my sore stomach was still there. It felt like my stomach acid was burning through to my skin.

I got ready as fast as I could when I woke up (8am) to catch the bus at 9:30am, but when I got ready in time and started thinking of catching the bus I got the wave of stomach cramps again and missed the bus by sitting on the toilet. I felt so fucking guilty.

I told myself I'd catch the next bus at 10:55am, which I got ready for, and 5 minutes before the bus came again I got hit with needing to shit again, which made me miss the same bus a second time. I sat on the floor and started crying, and I still am. I live in Australia and this is one of the first good days its been this whole holidays, as its been raining and storming almost every other day. Today was the most perfect day to go outside and see him and I was too much of a pussy to force myself to get on that bus. 

Now that I'm sitting here, regretting my choices of just standing still knowing I could've ran 2 minutes down the road to catch the bus, feeling less sick and my stomach is miraculously feeling better. This shit is so annoying to the point that I can't even go outside anymore or simply THINK about going outside without feeling intense stomach cramps and nausea. I get that I was unwell last night but oh my god, I seriously can't help but cry my eyes out knowing I could've seen him (when I've been waiting all week super excited) and I just threw it away because of a simple need to shit. 

He wants to understand, but I don't think he can and it makes me feel so bad. I feel so bad promising him and talking to him a couple days before that we're gonna have so much fun only for me to miss the bus TWICE all because I get stuck on the toilet.

I don't deserve this shit and neither does my friends or my boyfriend or my family always keeping up with my problems. I always cancel plans last minute because of my anxiety, stress and lowkey depression and stomach issues and I feel the only thing I deserve is to feel more pain. Why should I feel good when everything I eat puts me in immense pain, and when I want to go out and be healthy and enjoy the lovely weather that I get cursed with this shit? 

It's not every day where I'm able to go out and do what I want. Theres two or so weeks left of the school holidays and I'm throwing it away by fucking sitting here, crying over missing my bus twice and feeling so sick. I want to genuinely just be able to see my friends and my boyfriend without the fear of me throwing up, shitting myself or crying. "
192v1oe,Anxiety,2024-01-10,I haven’t been able to even touch my tension issues for 6 years and they’re destroying me. What do I do?,"I have extreme ear/head tension that pretty much forces me to be bed bound. The brain fog and fatigue that it causes are extreme. I can’t take it anymore. I need something that can help. Benzos, muscle relaxers, nerve blockers, and Botox does nothing. Help. Me. This is horrific. I need help. 

I don’t feel the anxiety, it’s all just physical.

EDIT: heat/cold doesn’t work either. Sometimes I can get a tiny bit of relief by baring down hard on the top of my head and sometimes the sides of my head."

192uwe9,Anxiety,2024-01-10,Tell me how to care less about what people think?,"Sorry, this might be long. I struggle a lot with what people think of me, but for whatever reason, I have even more anxiety about how people view my loved ones. My parents own two local businesses, I manage both of them, so I see my parents everyday. Between both businesses, we have about 50 employees. All of which know me of course, as well my parents. I LOVE my parents and think the world of them. They are the hardest working people I know and are so giving and caring. I know I am their daughter and am biased, but I have people come up to me left and right telling me what amazing parents I have. I am very proud to be their daughter. But, there will always problematic people out there, and some of them end of being our employees. I could give a million stories, but in general, I have a lot of anxiety when it comes to people straight up lying about situations that have never happened. Since I am the manager, I am often in the room when my parents handle problems with employees. So I am always aware of the problem, as well as what was communicated between both parties. My parents are very calm and understanding people. I have seen employees do some of the most crazy, disrespectful things, and never have my parents raised their voice, call them out in front of others, etc. they always handle it privately and professionally. I will then be walking in a hallway to hear “said employee” telling their coworkers the most wild, outlandish, lie I have ever heard. I will always go stand up for my parents in these situations, but it keeps me up at night wondering how many stories there are out there of my parents that I haven’t happened to overhear that simply never happened? I have this large fear of someone thinking my parents are terrible people based on something that wasn’t true. How do I work through this? I am a 23 year old female and my parents are both 45."
192umpv,Anxiety,2024-01-10,My boss said the smell of my lunch lingers and now it's just going around and around in my brain...,"I don't know if this is the right place for this or not; please let me know and I will remove it, or I won't be offended if it is removed and someone points me in the right direction.

Quick-quick overview: Female, married, grown children (moved out), mid-fifties, job, had anxiety at some level my entire life.

I work in an office in a one-story building, which is about 9,000 square feet US. We have a head boss, an assistant boss, me (Administrative Assistant to the head boss), a custodian, and a handful of other employees who drift in and out. Not a big operation, but we specialize. Head Boss (HB), Assistant Boss (AB) and me work in an office area about 1,500 square feet. We each have our own office, and there is a separate conference room/break room with a microwave, coffee grinder and coffee pot, mini-fridge, and conference table. I usually eat my lunch at my desk, by personal preference. I also usually work through lunch, also by personal preference.

I have several food allergies and intolerances, so it is very difficult for me to just grab lunch at a restaurant. On days I work, I also tend to make lunch my meal of the day, and have just a light supper (or skip it altogether). Therefore, I normally make my lunch and bring it in. It is usually something I can heat up in the microwave; a gluten free chicken pot pie, a bowl of vegetable soup, a bowl of gluten-free spaghetti, a package of pre-made gluten free chicken fettuccini alfredo. In the summer I often do gluten free sandwiches or salad with a piece of chicken breast that I've heated up in the microwave. So far, none of this has been a problem...or so I thought.

I spent a good part of today out of the office, at another part of our campus. I'd heated up a little cup of microwave oatmeal [(this oatmeal cup)](https://www.bobsredmill.com/shop/oats/gluten-free-brown-sugar-and-maple-oatmeal-cup.html) and was able to scarf that down before I had a meeting and then had to leave at about 11 AM, but I worked through lunch. I didn't get back to the office until about 3:45 and I'd not only had no lunch but no coffee. I'd brought a bowl of homemade Vegetable Beef Soup and gluten free crackers for lunch, and some chocolate pudding cups to keep in my desk for desserts. That bowl of soup sounded like the absolute tastiest thing in the world right then because I was **STARVING**.

I knew that HB was going to be having a group meeting in the conference room with AB and the other floater employees at 4:30. I just wanted to make my coffee, heat up my soup, and hide in my office. I mentioned how hungry I was to HB. He said, and this is pretty much a quote, ""Could you heat up your food in \[custodian's\] microwave? Your food has a very definite strong smell. It lingers.""

The custodian's area is all the way on the other side of the building from us. I really didn't want to carry a bowl of hot soup from one side of the building to the other. Plus, I was all of a sudden just hit with...the smell lingers? It *lingers?* Does it smell *bad?* Is it a *terrible* smell? Does it smell *gross?* Has it been smelling gross and lingering *the entire four years I've worked here and nobody has told me??? WHAT DOES HE MEAN, THE SMELL LINGERS??? OMG, I'M GROSSING OUT MY BOSS!!!*

I just stood there. I didn't know what to do. I finally just stuttered something like, ""Uh, okay, sorry,"" and went into my office and tried not to cry. (Failed, but at least it was quiet.) I already had my coffee, but I was still hungry. I finally just ate a pudding cup and some of the crackers that I brought to eat with my soup. I was so looking forward to that soup; I made it myself and it is good soup, but now I don't even care about it.

I understand that HB didn't want food odors hanging around while he was trying to have his meeting. They do close the door of the conference room and whatever smells are in there are just trapped there. I get it. And HB really isn't a jerk, even though I may have painted him as one; he's actually a very nice guy who gave me a chance at a job when nobody else would. I'm very grateful to him and I like him very much. He's just one of those people who are very blunt, and he doesn't think about how he could say something nicely or if what he is saying could be misconstrued. It literally doesn't occur to him that someone could take offense to things he says, because to him he is just saying a true fact. I'm sure he just meant that he didn't want a food odor cloud hanging out with them in their meeting.

But...it just hit me like a brick, and I have been so upset ever since. Everyone has now left the office and I'm still here, crying because I'm afraid my food has been stinking up the place and nobody told me, and now I'm afraid to even bring in anything to eat that needs to be heated up. Like I said, I can't just go to McDonald's or Arby's or wherever and grab food that's already cooked for me.

In fact, I've gotten myself so worked up that I feel myself getting sleepy, which always happens when I am overstimulated emotionally (I think I'm somewhat narcoleptic). The doctor gave me Buspirone 5 mg to take when I feel overwhelmed, but it doesn't seem to be doing much. And I feel nauseous, which is probably the coffee on an empty stomach. I need to eat lunch at work tomorrow. I don't know if I can do it!"
192umdw,Anxiety,2024-01-10,The feeling of empowerment I get after making a phone call,"I have phone anxiety, specifically for people I am not close with. I chose a field of work where I very rarely have to make phone calls as a result. However, on the odd occasion I do have to call clients if no one else is able to do so.

There’s something about the feeling I get after I do make a successful phone call (which is most of the time now that I have more experience and know what to say). I feel empowered and that I could accomplish anything in that moment. I feel proud of myself. My best days are where I have to make a phone call first thing because I am on a high for the rest of the day. Though I could just feel happier knowing I don’t need to make any more for the day…

However, no matter how strong this positive feeling is, I still struggle with the anticipation before every call.

Anyone else feel the same?"

192tmqo,Anxiety,2024-01-09,Does anyone else feel ashamed of having anxiety?,"What the title says. I don't tell people in my life I have it, only real close family and friends. I'm scared people someday will know I'm like this. I try my best to hide when I feel anxious or uncomfortable and try to act normal. It's more dificult when I'm having a full panic attack and that make me don't wanna have that much social interactions because I fear having a panic attack and scare the other people. When I'm having a panic attack all I can think about is ""I'm gonna die"" and ""Everybody will think I'm crazy"". My terapist said having anxiety is not that rare, a lot of people have it, is normal, no one will judge, but she doesn't have it how would she know?

192tls6,Anxiety,2024-01-09,How do you manage anxiety in your job?,"I’m specifically interested to hear from people who deal with perfectionism. ‘High achievers’ and/or those with deep fear of failing. Those who procrastinate every slightly intimidating task.

Has anyone left a more ‘complex’ career for one that is less stressful?

Context: throughout my degree and jobs as a researcher and teacher, I (F25) have had paralysing perfectionist anxiety. I’m exhausted."
192tjqm,Anxiety,2024-01-09,Is this just my health anxiety flaring ?,"New symptoms I’m dealing with the last two weeks.

Perceived sensitivity (I’ll touch the top of my head or the back of my neck or top of forearm near elbow and I’ll immediately spiral into panic and obsessive touching because it feels “off” or maybe like it has “reduced sensitivity”. I will then touch the same spot a few hours later and it feels like the sensitivity has been restored. Idk. 

Twitching, especially my feet. More than usual. 

Internal vibrations, which feel like I have a buzzing or vibrating sensation in my legs and chest. It’s not something you can see outside of my body. 

Increased tinnitus, which has really sucked. 

Talking at night feels almost like a chore when I’m tired, like my tongue has to work extra hard and I’ll find myself obsessing about it until I start to stutter or trip up over words.




Could this all be from my hyperawarness/OCD/health anxiety?


BTW-

Here are the symptoms I’ve also had the last 3 months - all of these started when my pinched nerve started, I’m a pro guitarist so I’ve been on high alert anxiety every day for the last 18 weeks as my pinched nerve slowly l heals 

* My daily anxiety revolves around MS, Stroke, Parkinson’s, heart attack or fear of going deaf. - I have gotten a neck mri without contrast, ct scans, EMG, etc.- I am getting a brain mri with contrast but I’m assuming it’ll be negative.
 
* Weird sensation back of throat after waking up with dry mouth

* Tingling limbs like they’re falling asleep or like they’re fizzing underneath my skin (for a week now starting when I started getting sick)

* Fear of swallowing

* The two weeks of hyperaucisis and ear wobbling 

* Fear of becoming schizophrenic 


* Tingling all over body (my cervical radiculopathy hand tingles cuz of the pinched nerve but that’s a totally different sensation of tingling, that’s more intense and triggered by movements)


* Perceived sensation of slurring or messing up words, but everyone says I sound normal

* Feeling like I can’t breath and am having a heart attack

* Derealization


* Constantly testing my voice, recording myself talking 


* Colder than normal, I’m usually always running way too hot and need AC on even in winter - but I’ve also lost like 70 lbs this year. 


* Lowered appetite 


* Can’t sleep - I wake up after 2-3 hours every night so I sleep in blocks 


* Left side of tongue and left corner of mouth tingles sometimes 

* Worry that my hands are losing dexterity and strength so I’ll test them by catching things or squeezing things


* Always testing heart rate with a finger device


* Intense depressive episodes lasting a few hours where I feel hopeless 


* Waking up with one eye blurry and irritated and dry , lasts a few hours and happens every few weeks/started 2 months ago


* Obsessed about the eye that gets blurry sometimes, I’ll film both eyes to test that they close and open at same time 


* Always testing my hearing (I have a disease of the ears, but it’s still way too much and too obsessive)


* Daily rumination of death and non existence which gives me incredible


* Fear of taking pills or new medication because I’m worried it’ll cause horrendous side effects 


* Dry mouth"

Hi guys so i (19F) get this really weird chest feeling sometimes and it’s either on one side or throughout, but it’s like a general discomfort, not really painful. it’s very odd and it’s like i can’t FEEL it there but it’s not on the outside side of my chest it’s like in the middle of whatever side or area i feel it in and i keep trying to stretch or move around to relieve it in some way? idk it’s super weird idk if anyone else gets something similar but it never gets worse or stays for long periods of time like once i stop focusing on it by doing something else or i just forget i suddenly don’t feel it anymore. i’ve been checked like at least 3 times in the past two months at the ER so the crazy heart check up  and chest check ups and everything is fine so i’m certain it’s just my anxiety but it’s REALLY weird and i’m just wondering if anyone else relates"
192t6uz,Anxiety,2024-01-09,Quit my job for my mental health but now worried about money,"Quit my job, but worried about money.

I had to do something very hard today. I had to quit my job. It was not a decision I took lightly. Unfortunately it was my first real job and it was sponsored by vocational rehab, which makes me feel bad about quitting. However, I need to prioritize my mental health. I am a 25 year old individual living with multiple disabilities including type 1 diabetes, adhd and anxiety. The job was causing me a lot of stress and anxiety. I spent 4 hours at the therapy office yesterday. They are also adjusting my anxiety medication, I’m still testing adhd meds. I would like to work but I’m not sure what I want to do. Sitting around and collecting disability is not an option. There has to be something im good at. Both my boss and vocational rehab are proud of me for prioritizing my mental health. However, I am still worried about money, despite the fact that I live with my parents. If I don’t work, I won’t be able to have an income. Money is a big stressor in my life. And I’m also trying to not feel like a failure. Maybe I can craft or sell something on etsy. Or freelance/gig work. There has to be something I’m good at. I’m just not sure what. My plan for now is to priorize my mental health, and I asked my therapy office if I was able to come in twice a week so we shall see what they say. I’m probably not the first one to quit my job due to stress. But I’m afraid I’m
The first one to quit their first job. Thank you for taking time to read this post. It was very hard for me to write."

192p44u,Anxiety,2024-01-09,My parents don't think anxiety is real and don't support meds,"

I'm a 21 year old and I stuggle with decently bad anxiety. I never used to have any type of anxiety and in fact was one of those people that didn't really beleive/understand it at all. About three or so years ago my family completely relocated and went from NJ to NC. I had no friends and my relationship eventually ended due to long distance struggles. Me being 18 at the time I couldn't afford to stay in NJ so I was basically forced to move with my parents. The first year or so I hated it and I worked through it and still was able to work and provide for myself. After about a year I ended up in the emergency room six times in two weeks due to panic attacks and me having no idea what's happening. I've since been diagnosed with anxiety but I don't want to take meds. I've been trying for about a year now to deal with it without meds but it's getting to the point where functioning normally is a struggle. I get up to was the dishes and have anxiety attacks and feel like I can't breathe. I go out with my current partner and can't even bring myself to go into the building to eat. Many people around me tell me I should seek help or medication but I'm honestly terrified. My parents are both 60+ years of age and old fashioned and don't really think anciety exists. My sister's have fucked up on drugs before and I'm the only kid who hasn't. I brought the idea of potential medication to my mom and she just shut it down saying ""any excuse for you to not work"". I'm in between a rock and a hard spot because I don't want to dissapoint my parents by taking these meds they don't support. But on the other hand the reason I can't keep a job or function is because of my anxiety. I feel weak even saying this lol because I want to work. I want to function normally. I'm just not sure how to go about that. The main question is , how do I go about this? Do I just try and figure this out on my own or is medication the best option for me? Because where I stand right now it seems like either way I'm a dissapointment to my parents."

192sf2e,Anxiety,2024-01-09,Why am I like this?,"Quick background info: I'm 32. 15-ish yrs ago, my good friend and I loved to play Red Dead Redeption, Minecraft, COD, and a bunch of other games. A few years later, as I got older and moved to college, I stopped gaming. I was never hard-core into it, but back then, it had been nice.

Fast forward to me now. I started up RDR2 again a few month ago and have now just spent my time doing random RDR2 things, since I've completed the story. It makes me happy and focused when I play, but I have to be in the mood to play.

My boyfriend has tried to show me other games--Elden Ring, Dark Souls games, 2-player partner games, etc--but I can't get into them and have zero interest in asking if he wants to play them.

His best friend has started playing Minecraft together with his wife and my boyfriend asked me if I wanted to try that. I said I was interested, made my character (my favorite part) last night with him, and then we didn't play. I said I was getting tired, which was true, but I just didn't want to play. So I said we could play tomorrow (which is today).

I've been anxious over it all day, and even took a nap to kill time. I do that frequently when I'm feeling extra depressed or worked up. Idk if it's a routine thing that is preventing me from wanting to play Minecraft. It seems so trivial, but then why am I struggling so hard and why do I want to cry?

I don't want my boyfriend to be upset with me. I want to want to play with him and build us a cool house where I can be a farmer, but I simply cannot bring myself to show any interest.

This kind of situation has prevented me from doing things and ""going out of my comfort zone"" in the past. What's wrong with me?"
192sa8u,Anxiety,2024-01-09,I’ve ruined my life because of my anxiety of change,"I have always had a very hard time dealing with change.  I remember the transition from middle school to high school was very difficult for me at first.  

And now ever since I’ve graduated high school (5 years ago now) I’ve had a harder and harder time commiting to a full time job.  

I was staying at my job from high school, but then I had to leave due to society and family pressuring me.  Every job I’ve tried since then I’ve gotten fired at or I just give up on.  All because I’m afraid of change and committing to something unfamiliar.  I don’t know why but I get filled with this huge sense of dread that my “old” life will be over even though I know that’s not true and it’s stupid to think that.

I wish I could go back to my old job but now I can’t.  How can I get over this fear of change that has ruined my life?"

I’m miserable to put it plainly and I want to try and start medication even if it just helps a little. However my parents are against it, they think I’ll get addicted and that this is something I need to overcome naturally as it’s all in my head. I know I’m technically an adult and can start it myself but it will cause tension in my house, I don’t need that. I’m also pretty scared about taking medication myself so I want my mum to support me through the side effects and everything. How can I bring this up, what can I say for them to even consider it? I feel like if they knew just how badly I’m suffering like I’m having some real dark thoughts then they would maybe think about it but it’s so hard to express that to them, any advice?"

Do any of you have similar symptoms as me? Is there a way to fight it? I am just tired of living in fear and anxiety 24/7.

I was really nervous when I had to go to the board and explain one (my luck: 4 problems and over 30 people) but luckily it was one I understood well. I was really nervous but I managed to get everything correct.

After sitting down again I looked at my hand and it was shaking. Not a light shaking that you could compare to vibrating. It was really strong. I'm just glad it started after going back to my desk, I don't think I could ever go to that class again if I started shaking while writing something on the board.

I always thought I was just an idiot and imagining things but recently I started think there is actually something wrong with me."
192rx2o,Anxiety,2024-01-09,Transient problem with sleep is putting me on edge,"Basically I think my body is readjusting to a prescription stimulant after a break from it and it’s making me unable to sleep.

It’s Wednesday and I don’t think I’ve had more than 5 hours sleep all up since Sunday.

My anxiety symptoms tend to spike when I’m particularly tired so my throat feels tight, I keep having jolts of anxiety and other bodily sensations.  The thing is, my body is tired, like, you know when you’re tired to the point where you kind of feel drunk?  I have that, but my brain is still wired, I’m somehow mentally alert, when I’m in bed my eyes don’t feel tired and my brain feels frustratingly awake and fresh.  The rest of me wants to sleep.

On top of that, because of the anxiety, I keep thinking “what if there’s a brain tumor keeping me awake”?  Like, obviously not, my sleep schedule was off from the holidays in conjunction with taking a stimulant, I know it’s that but I keep thinking “what if”?

I’d feel better after a nights sleep but I just can’t get that right now."

After I graduated the doc that we get prescriptions from was impressed with how much I had improved so he let me wean off them.   Little did we know

Half a year later I became severely depressed and lost the ability to think or talk.  Sad empty feeling. Then I got sent to a second referral just to be told to go back on them. Lol. 

I still hate the idea of taking a capsule everyday forever like a dependency.   Every doctor I have asked if I can get off them again has said no suggested “No. do you want to go back to where you were back then?” 

Sometimes. I still get annoyed with having to take these stupid tablets everyday.   Do you think it’s worth a shot seeing if I can get off it a second time?"

I work in the gaming/tech industry for a while now and I have this problem where I always feel like I’m going to ruin all of my equipment. For example, I spilled a glass of water on my floor while I was working at my desk. I know nothing important got wet but I basically convinced myself that I completely ruined my pc or that it may be ruined because what if water got inside. I hate that I do this because now I can barely focus on my tasks because I’m just looking for something that may be wrong with my equipment since the water spillage. Or if I’m compiling a script and it take a little bit longer than usual, that is confirmation in my brain that I ruined my stuff. This is all completely irrational and even if something happened I am absolutely capable of replacing any component like nothing happened yet I can’t get past the fear / anxiety that I just fucked myself.

But I did have my first panic attack around last year near at the end of November and my anxiety was just awful and body was in panic mode(though I never had another panic attack).

But I did experience for awhile that when I laid in bed my legs would start shaking like I was cold which would sometimes move up my body.And my heart would start pounding which I would hear in my ear and my tinnitus in my left wear would get significantly louder which caused me to freak out and had to have my mom sleep with me every time it happened.

 This persisted for a while and calmed down  until the near end of December and finally went away completely by December 31st.

But I guess my body got so used to stress that I’ve been experiencing really bad anxiety symptoms(like heart palpitations,  dissociation,depersonalization,dizziness,etc) but those things don’t actually bother me or interfere with my life like it does for some people since I’ve always dealt with those things and kind of gotten used to how to manage them that when they do happen they just go away.

But one in particular has just made me miserable and it usually only happen at night when I lay down and it’s a sort of vibrating/buzzing feeling only in my chest area and it gets really bad when I lay down(especially laying on my left side) and sometimes moves around just my chest area but also goes down a little above the stomach area. It always happens when I either just to lay down or to sleep and doesn’t go away until I fall asleep. 
It’s been pretty bad the past two days and has seeped into continuing during the day.

Has anyone experienced this and if so what have you done or did to either help manage it  or make it go away completely so that it’s  not so uncomfortable and sometimes a little painful?

Also sometimes other anxiety symptoms mix with it making it scarier. I try not to think about it but it’s so difficult. 

I’ve tried meditation, breathe works, but because of the buzzing it doesn’t help at all.

I’m not a hypochondriac by any means but because of this unknown feeling my anxiety always convinces me I’m gonna have a heart attack.

I was given Hydroxazine by my doctor as a temporary solution/treatment for anxiety but it hasn’t really helped at all like it seems to have done for some people.

I was recommended by my dad since he suffers from panic attacks to take  Ashwagandha(more specifically the Goli gummies)to see if that helps? 

I’ve already went ahead a purchased some and I took only one gummy(150mg) last night an hour before I went to bed just to try it although the bottle recommends 2gummies(300mg) which I’ll do tonight.

I don’t feel like I’ve gone a single day without experiencing some type of anxiousness. It gets to the point that my anxiety gets to be obsessive. Especially with obsessive anxious thinking. 

For about 5 months now I been dealing with the biggest depressive/anxious episodes of my life. I feel so incredibly drained and always on edge. The reason for this is that my dad has started to act out like he did in my childhood. I have a covert narcissist father and during my childhood he caused me a lot of trauma. I won’t get into it because a lot of it is extremely triggering but to say the least it was bad and very repetitive. His behavior has left a big impact on my life and he refuses to take accountability for his actions. 

The past 5 months he has been repeating this behavior and it has honestly put me into fight or flight mode. It has been incredibly exhausting but I honestly feel so anxious all of the time and also very agitated. I have gone from healing myself to falling right back to where I was before if not worse. I’ve been such an anxious and angry mess that it’s beginning to feel like I’m not even myself anymore.

Need Opinion / Advice / Suggestion...

This might be wrong forum but i m taking the risk. I (31F) had a long suspicion that I may be on some / low spectrum of ADHD. I did a few online tests which told me I do have ADHD but I didn't purchase the whole diagnosis so again I am not completely sure about this. I have anxiety and do feel depressed sometimes which I thought might be because of ADHD (I might be wrong). I took the official ADHD test after my therapist suggested it, but while going through the test I felt that not all the questions were relatable for me. Like I am super detail-oriented but then again I like structured things, same pattern stuff, and I am not able to focus nowadays. I feel I am at a total loss here as I don't know how to go ahead after this. My therapist is suggesting to start Anti-anxiety and Anti-depressants but I am not sure about this.

I used to be extroverted, life of the party, and had no issues with body weight or metabolism.

Now I'm overweight, dread going outside and everything in my body hurts. The transformation happened very quickly since 2019 and I haven't acclimated to my new reality where I wake up with dread every day. 


If I do go outside or attend a social gathering, I'm constantly met with people who are shocked and will ask ""what happened to you?"", because my hair, face, eyes and body are no longer what they used to be. 

I worked out, did yoga thrive a week, lifted weights, but the weight comes back when I stop spending 20 hours in the gym every week. 

My diet is clean but I can't seem to fix my situation with just diet or exercise. Therapists have told me that my coping mechanisms are healthy so I have no recourse over there. 

I feel hopeless and I am worried that my best days are far behind me.

192o75q,Anxiety,2024-01-09,Might’ve finally found a sleep solution…,"Found the “Brain Food” playlist on Spotify as a double whammy: 

1. Insomnia - historically, it’s taken me 1+ hours to fall asleep at night. I’ve used it the past 3 nights in a row for falling asleep, and it’s worked every time - I’m asleep within 15 mins. Maybe because it forces my brain to concentrate…. On sleeping lol.

2. ADHD - i have so much trouble with focusing on tasks at work, and this playlist has helped me activate hyperfocus. It puts me in a hypnotic state and somehow, I just get shit done now lol.

This stuff might not work for you, but just wanted to share if anyone else has or has had similar struggles :)."
192ntbi,Anxiety,2024-01-09,What do you do when you actually have a reason?,"Have always had anxiety but now I have a really real reason (mom just got diagnosed with you know what). So now it feels like my life was anxiety training and this is the anxiety Olympics. I'll call my gp tomorrow but in the UK they don't really do much for GAD and I'm not sure they'll offer anything. Meanwhile I'm so anxious I truly didn't think it was possible to feel this way. I can't sleep more than a couple hours at a time and I'm radiating anxiety. 
What a fucker eh?"
192nq35,Anxiety,2024-01-09,I’m 45 and I decided to take charge of my anxiety.,"I’m not sure what’s going on with me this last year. I started having daily headaches around my birthday last year and I still don’t have a diagnosis. Since then I’ve had a rough year but I’ve also had some good things happen. I got on anxiety medicine that’s actually working. Cymbalta. I feel, for the first time in my life, what it’s like to live without anxiety. Or mostly. I still have some but nothing like what it was. And I realize that it has literally been with me for my entire life. Since I was a child. All of my childhood behaviors that were so weird and unexplainable even to me, suddenly make sense in the context of anxiety. Nobody bothered to diagnose me with anything back in the 80’s. I was just a problem child. I had behavioral issues. I lashed out. I couldn’t control my emotions. No emotional regulation at all. Probably ADHD. No diagnosis on that either. Nobody cared to determine why I was the way I was, they just disciplined me which made my anxiety worse. I was labeled weird  and a crybaby. I’m probably neurodivergent but, again, nobody bothered to find out. And I’m having to figure out my own brain in my 40’s.  

I decided I’m not going to let anxiety rule me anymore. I lost my whole life to it. I refuse to lose the rest of my life to it. I’m going to go out and do more things. I love rock and metal concerts so I’m going to go to more. I’m so mad that not one person in my life when I was a kid thought to figure out what was going on with my behavior. Instead I was just labeled a bad kid when I was just trying to make myself heard. I got into so much trouble with my teachers. I got bullied in school. My childhood was not fun. I’m just sorry it took me this long to figure this stuff out."
192ng1w,Anxiety,2024-01-09,Does anxiety make you feel disconnected from your friends?,"I've noticed that when my anxiety is bad (which it currently is) I feel disconnected from my friends. I'm so anxious and in my head that it kind of just takes me out of whatever is happening in the moment. I end up leaving feeling weird and overthinking everything I did and said.

 I hung out with a friend yesterday and it just wasn't fun. I overthought everything I did and said which led me to not being myself and kind of just being weird.

 Anyone else experience this? Tips on dealing with it? I feel like the friend could feel my weirdness and now I'm worried about that 🫠"

192n99l,Anxiety,2024-01-09,Persistent anxiety symptoms,"Total disclaimer first- I am going to see a doctor about this but I was curious if anyone else has experienced this as well. 

I (24F) have suffered from anxiety for as long as I can remember , and I have been diagnosed with GAD and Panic Disorder. Therapy on and off in my life has helped me to be able to manage my symptoms for the most part- until recently. 
I’ve experienced some stressful life events the last 6 months, and my grandfather just passed on Christmas day. I feel like it all has finally caught up to me, and for the last week and half I’ve been experiencing what feels like a mild panic attack coming and going all day long. I have chest pains, shortness of breath, my heart hurts, I have knots in my stomach, racing thoughts and it feels like my stomach is in my throat. Normally I could do breathing exercises or try to calm myself other ways - but this time none of that works. It’s just a persistent, anxiety attack feeling. I wake up with it and go to sleep with it. I’m now worried I’m wrecking my heart because I can’t seem to get ahold of my anxiety. So I’m also giving myself anxiety about having anxiety…. It’s not a great time. 
Has anyone experienced this? Or can give recommendations on what helped them? Thanks in advance!"
192n7a8,Anxiety,2024-01-09,Anxiety,"Anxiety comes and goes for me. Sometimes it accentuates because of some baseline happiness or nitpicky mood swings. But, it was always there. Sometimes its so bad that I would question my place in this world. Sometimes I would drink a lot. Sometimes I would engage in self harm. There was a point that I wanted to die, but, decided that the pain wouldn't stop after death than what I feel now so I decided to claw up and try and live life. Life had these fleeting spots of beauty and I decided to focus on that. I still do. It's hard to do but it's so worth it. That bit of love and beauty is precious. I was aggressive in changing my perception and at 41, am still being aggressive but I can now control the pains in my body and my mind. I try and think of life in it's most vulnerable moment or love in the same way. 

I take vitamins to deal with my anxiety and also practice mindfulness and mediation. My mind does not control me, I control it. I understand it's a bit of separation but when the mind and body come together, it's utopia."
192meee,Anxiety,2024-01-09,Anxiety induced workaholism and over productivity,"I feel like I’m in a constant cycle of overworking to the point of burnt out and serious illness then telling myself that I’m going to change and stop this madness only to fall back into the same hole of despair. All last year I was filling my calendar with never ending tasks, applying to jobs, reading, taking on new hobbies. It was fine though because I was going to therapy which would mean that really I was doing fine, or so I would tell myself. I crashed in December. Became seriously sick and no amount of taking it easy, slow or looking after myself was working. I am still sick writing this. I’m so worried all the time, and so terrified and in pain. Being preoccupied means that I don’t have a minute to stop and think about everything that brings me pain.everything is fine as long as I’m doing 12hr+ days studying full time, applying to jobs, working out, doing multiple hobbies. On the outside, all seems to be fine, but inside I feel like I’m constantly trying to keep it together and I am seriously terrified of losing control."
192lz1h,Anxiety,2024-01-09,Anyone else have similar physical symptoms,"I know that the Internet for medical advice is not trust worthy. I tried calling my general physician with these symptoms and she told me ""it's just anxiety take a valium"". Well, my valium wore off.

In the beginning of November/end of October, I statt3d experiencing heightened anxiety. I've been experiencing these symptoms for about two months. In started with difficulty swallowing water or more watery fruits like grapes or oranges. I would often choke on water. Then I began feeling tightness in my throat. 

Around that time I had a flu, so I'm not sure what is flu symptoms or anxiety.

Awful acid reflux appeared. I read that if you have reflux or GERD it's entirely possible to feel tightness in the throat or to have difficulty swallowing. 

I continue to have these symptoms. I feel as if my throat is narrowing at the bottom and as If I costantly have something in stuck in my throat and as If I have to constantly cough or clear my throat. 

The symptoms worsen in the evening and at night. 

My mom used to have similar difficulty swallowing and throat tightness, when she experienced a very stressful period in her life. 

The symptoms do seem to worse when I panic about the symptoms. 

I just need to know is it possible all this to be from anxiety or should I get myself checked out?"

192l6sj,Anxiety,2024-01-09,Coffee helps my anxiety,"I always wake up with a certain amount of existential dread. Heart pounding, physical anxiety where I feel exhausted despite having just woken up from sleeping for eleven hours. 

Coffee doesn't just give me energy, it also undoubtedly soothes this anxiety; I can come off the verge of a panic attack after a cup. I don't really understand this, as for many people, caffeine seems to do the exact opposite. I've been drinking at least three cups a day due to this, like a form of self medication, and even on days where I exceed this, I never face consequence for it. 

Does anyone have a possible explanation?"
192l0ex,Anxiety,2024-01-09,Helping wife through anxiety and possible panic disorder,"So my wife has always been anxious - known her for some 15 years now. She had some panic and anxiety periods 9 years ago due to being waked up every 15 minutes by our first child for some weeks. She got through it and didnt have panic attacks since. 

However, work related stress has now triggered some very serious symptoms (constant anxiety, GAD, no sleep and constant panic attacks). We just got her on a benzo for the panic attacks and she will take sleeping pills for some time.

We are in good hands with competent doctors and phychologists amd lots of support, but right now it feels very dark. She will start sertralin in a couple of days.

Im off work to take care of her and my dad takes care of our whole family (shopping cooking etc).

Are we doing the right things?

What do you think will come off this? She didnt have panic attacks for 9 years - do people return to ""normal"" after such episodes?"

192jja6,Anxiety,2024-01-09,Why doesn't this go away? Am I having a heart attack??,"So I've been getting weird flairs that make me feel super anxious, nauseated and also raises my heart rate very quick, like turning a switch or something.
Today I was at work,  attending a meeting when sudden wave of weird tingle like tension or a flush goes through my veins and I sort of feel like my veins tense up?? 

My hr jumped from 70 to 110bpm while sitting still and it started to bounce around 105-130bpm without doing anything. Of course that led to an awful feeling in my body and mind started to go like ""oh fuck, I've had this before but this time it must be a heart attack!!!"". I felt the strange flushing feeling in my veins and around my body while my hr just stayed high. 

Tried breathing exercises, talking myself out of it etc. Nothing worked. I took some propral and benzos and only then managed to get hr under 100bpm after an hour of feeling terrible, fainty and dizzy , still also panicking and feeling very anxious. I've continued to feel anxious and had my heart rate in the 90-105 zone after two 40mg propral and opamox 30mg and it's been 12 hours.

My face and ears feel tingly and hot and I still feel nauseated and tired. Is this typical for an anxiety attack to stuck like this and not go away? What kind of tricks should I try? 

I have been to the ER couple of times before when I felt similar, but they couldn't find anything wrong"

192j1p5,Anxiety,2024-01-09,A little update on medication and trying to get pregabalin,"I posted in December about being denied pregabalin by the GP because I'm child bearing age, so I sent an econsult and told them how much I don't want kids. They gave me an appointment for today (3 week wait) and I thought it was with a different doctor but it turned out to be a nurse. I don't mean to be rude to nurses but I don't see the point in speaking to them about mental health medication when they can't prescribe anything. Anyway, she had to go off and ask the doctor as she couldn't do anything. The doctor comes back saying to refer me to psychiatry. So I'm not being prescribed anything for now and I have to wait an unknown amount of time. 

In the mean time, I've been thinking more about whether pregabalin is even a good idea. I've read about it wearing off after a while and stopping working. Also idk if I'm comfortable taking a class C drug, it'll be annoying when traveling. But if I don't go on it, I'm not sure what my options are at this point. I feel like I've tried everything.

I'm on sertraline which helps but not enough. Others that I've tried and failed: fluoxotine, citalopram, propranolol, quertiapine, buspar, mirtazapine (the worst of them all). 

Feeling like ill never find something to help and I'll forever have my life dictated by anxiety. 

BTW I have been in therapy for years, doing EMDR. Done CBT. Tried meditation, yoga, breathing, all that at home. Doesn't help when I'm in total panic."
192iyxk,Anxiety,2024-01-09,Nausea/Vomiting during morning panic attacks?,"Hi,

First post here. I’m wanting to know if it’s common to have early morning anxiety (I’m talking like 3-5am) and for it to induce nausea and vomiting?

I’ve been waking up at around 3-5 every morning in a complete panic and I eventually vomit every morning. 

Is this common?"
192it9m,Anxiety,2024-01-09,Weird anxiety symptoms,"I have been dealing with anxiety and stress for about 3-4 years now. I have been through a lot of stressful situations(the death of a parent and other close relatives in a short amount of time, breakup, school stuff). I was relatively young when it all started ( around 16-17). Since then I've been struggling with anxiety and stress, plus I have been diagnosed with mild depression. Every day is different for me. I am a huge hypochondriac and I am extremely afraid of hospitals. Since my first time in the hospital ( last year) I have been weirdly afraid of it. I can't stop googling symptoms and looking for answers for everything. 

 Since my first anxiety attack, throughout 3-4 years I have had stomach issues, back issues, and head issues. I have developed IBS, went to the doctor and he told me to stop stressing. I had a weird vibrating sensation in my right ear that used to come and go for about a year, went to 4 different doctors and nothing was wrong but they told me to stop stressing because that was the issue. Had a headache on the top of my head like a headband feeling, went to the doctor and told me it was nothing, but the minute I stepped out it disappeared. I had a heartbeat that was beating too fast, I could hear my heart and feel it move, problems with manual breathing, and felt like I couldn't get enough air. Temple aches. None of them were anything crazy but made me scared and annoyed. 

 Besides these, I felt so tired most of the time, especially in the winter time, I get lightheaded and I am afraid I am going to faint in public, but it never happened. I sometimes have days when I feel like it all went away and then something happens and destroys my mood and it's all back.

My most recent symptom is different and weirder, I have eye problems sometimes and I feel like I can't focus on them. I am not going to lie, I spend a lot of time on my phone and that could be the issue. Sometimes when I am in public (which happens very rarely ) I get the feeling like I am in an elevator or on the trampoline and I am walking on it, it's very scary and annoying. I sometimes feel like I am in a dream and I am watching through tunnel vision, I can't explain it because it's very hard to compare it to something. When I stay in bed I get a sensation like I am moving a bit and I get scared and then it's more intense, I had a period when I was so obsessed with it that I felt it when I went to sleep as well. It's like someone is constantly pushing me. Sometimes I feel like my heart is beating in my brain and I get a rush feeling in it or in the back of my head, all of a sudden. I have never been extremely dizzy or anything like that. It disappears when I go out and I take my mind off of it or when I do something and I concentrate. It comes when I am in a crowded place, like the store or the gym. I know it's anxiety because it happens when I think about it and then it scares me and it worse.

i also sometimes in my sleep have a weird sensation like a head rush and I have to open my eyes because I get dizzy, it happens also when I have a stressful day. And then I have a hard time falling asleep, but this happens rarely. I think I am inducing these feelings because I keep thinking about them, but it scares me so much. My therapist says it's a normal anxiety symptom.

192ibbj,Anxiety,2024-01-09,Women with anxiety had successful pregnancies?,"I experienced my first episode of severe anxiety during the pandemic. My main issue is a vicious loop of anxiety and insomnia. So it's really debilitating when I'm not sleeping.

Thankfully, I got treated with meds and therapy, and since then, things have been pretty much under control. I've even got off meds 2 years ago.

Now my Bf and I have been TTC since July. The TTC journey immediately gave me an uptick in anxiety and sleep issues, but nothing too crazy. We got pregnant really fast and sadly miscarried in the 1st trimester.

Now, I just found out I'm pregnant again, and my anxiety and sleep issues are really flaring up. I can't help it; it's like my body has gone into an automatic fear response of somekind.

I'd love to hear from women who have conceived healthy children even with more serious anxiety.

I am not opposed to going on meds again, I just know that it's not a cure-all. I still struggle even while on them, so I'm not sure it's worth the pain of going on and off and dealing with withdrawals (intense rebound insomnia) again."

192hxqt,Anxiety,2024-01-09,I don’t know what else to do,"I feel like nothing is working.

I feel like since 2020 I’ve been drifting. Had horrible cystic acne breakout caused by a rare, bad reaction to accutane that left me with scars all over my cheeks, sent me into a deep depression where I got to 100 pounds from not eating.

One medication after another that didn’t work for my anxiety. Prozac gave me akathisia and panic attacks. Tons of SSRI withdrawal after being on them for 15 years.

Then comes dealing with a bad edible panic attack that landed me in the ER last December. Depersonalization/ derealization followed, along with nightmares and more panic attacks. When I say panic I don’t mean classic hyperventilation, I mean that weird break with reality where suddenly your vision becomes a tunnel and you feel yourself disconnecting and it’s utterly terrifying and then you can’t breathe and you legitimately feel you’re about to die.

Then I got food poisoning a month later that has lasted up until today - a slew of health issues, finding out I have a benign liver growth that’s the size of a lime, got pancreatitis and was in the hospital again for it (the trauma of a city understaffed ER is another story), found out my gallbladder barely works.

All this, while having issues with family (my sister had two suicide attempts many years ago) me lashing out at my partner out of trauma and causing damage to him emotionally, feeling utterly hopeless, on another SSRI that makes me an emotionless zombie but keeps the panic attacks and existential dread away. 

Somehow maintaining a full time job where everyone thinks I’m this star employee. What a joke, right? 

I’ve gotten to a point where I have no joy in my life. I’m just on autopilot getting through each day. Things that should have made me happy leave me numb. Even thinking about happy thoughts elicit little to no emotion.

The only emotions I can express are despair if I cry and break down, or extreme rage when I’m hurt.

But that’s it.

I don’t know how to fix myself at this point. I’ve been on 15 different psychiatric medications over the course of my life. One of them almost made me break. I am scared to keep trying and being a guinea pig.

I’m scared of the fact that my celexa makes me feel nothing at all most days.

I don’t know what to do."

I have an upset stomach all day, like I really need to go to the bathroom (#2) but by the time I get there, I don’t need to go. So it’s just a battle of do I actually have to go or not. I occasionally get spells of dizziness, just lightly. 
 If I am not moving, such as sitting around or laying down, I feel fine. So it’s kind of hard to get around what I’m actually feeling. 

I have experienced this before and just let it pass but I have a big trip coming up and it would really suck if this is how I felt the entire time.

Don't need medical advice I've already been to the hospital and everything was normal just looking to see if anyone has felt like this before. Some backstory ive been overly aware of my heartbeat for the past 2 years not sure why and around 3 months ago started having pvcs sometimes several in a minute not currently experiencing them.  
About 1 week ago I woke up in the middle of the night and felt confused, I knew where I was but felt like a plastic bag was put around my brain, my body and my thoughts didn't match what was going on when i moved my arm it would would a second later sort of like in quicksand. I went back to sleep hoping it would go away and after I woke up felt a bit better. 5 days ago I woke up with some arm discomfort nothing major but unusual as I hadn't done anything physical for weeks sort of felt like a pulling sensation inside the arm and sometimes like a burning sensation. Then around 3 days ago I stopped eating, I haven't been able to stomach anything, usually if I don't eat I feel fait but I just don't feel hungry and when I try to eat just have no appetite. Since then I've just been in bed 24/7 with my heart constantly beating hard but its never been as bad as this. I have no strength to get out of bed and do anything, even standing to use the toilet I feel faint and have no strength in my legs. Ive not been able to get a good long sleep im waking up a multiple times in the night with my heart racing and beating hard around 90bpm but i just ignore it and just and go back to sleep and my bed slightly wet when i wake up.  
Yesterday I went to the hospital as this isn't normal. The doctor said I was fine, temperature ecg bloods xray normal. likely just stress or anxiety. Today I woke and felt even worse, I tried to get up to feed my cats after being in bed for around 12 hours but my heart started beating hard not that fast and I felt a tiny small pain in my chest when moving, probably from the exhaustion and just collapsed back into my bed and the pain went away. I can't even move my legs they feel so weak and my left arm is burning if I just turn over in bed my heart rate shoots up for a couple seconds then goes back to normal. My blood pressure is elevated 140/85 not the usual 122/80 and I just feel so ill. I've never felt like this in my life i feel like im in a trance and when laying down im not seeing straight. I'm scared that I won't get better I understand it's likely anxiety but I've been dealing with anxiety for the past 2 years and have never experienced this I still don't feel hungry and even though I want to eat to give my body strength and just feel dizzy and lethargic."

i’m terrified of modern medicine (i literally freak over taking tylenol LOL) so i decided to try different natural options for my anxiety, one of them being kava. i had tried it once before at a kava bar and did really enjoy the way it made me feel generally more relaxed, a little giggly, and i had read some articles about kava as a daily anxiety treatment, so i gave it a try. i bought a tincture at whole foods and would take it once or twice a day in a little water. the first couple times it was fine, but i guess i didnt really believe the whole reverse tolerance thing until i experienced it. i would take it in the car before hanging out with friends, and eventually ended up getting heart palpitations and feeling lightheaded almost immediately. those symptoms would just freak me out and worsen my anxiety, and the weird uncomfortable feeling i got just wasnt worth it. i switched to cbd, and its been a total life saver the past couple months. every now and then, ill still use the kava tincture to make myself a few drinks if im with friends who are drinking actual alcohol (i dont drink alc), and i love it just as a fun drink. ill have 3ish drinks and nearly pee my pants from laughing and feeling so light and giddy. but yeah. please dont try it for every day. just wanted to share my experience in case anyone needed to hear the other end of it."
192gxhh,Anxiety,2024-01-09,Post Covid Panic Disorder - Seeking Support,"I wanted to share a bit about my recent experience after contracting COVID for the first time.

After recovering, I started experiencing tachycardia, for which my doctor prescribed beta blockers. Negative POTS test and cardiology cleared organ damage. Unfortunately, this led to extreme anxiety, especially health-related anxiety, and I found myself dealing with multiple panic attacks daily. I tried various coping methods like walking, meditation, and breathing techniques, but they didn't provide the relief I was hoping for.

In the midst of this, I had to resort to immediate-release Xanax during panic attacks, which helped but left me feeling like a bit of a zombie. I'm hesitant about becoming dependent on it and was desperate to find a more sustainable solution.

My doctor recommended Xanax XR 0.5mg for preventing attacks and suggested starting Lexapro. He mentioned that he's seen an increase in cases like mine post-COVID and, based on his experience, around 80% of similar cases have found relief with Lexapro.

I've had my reservations, especially about the side effects, but the constant struggle with anxiety has prompted me to give it a try. I've also tried various natural methods without success, so I'm hoping this might be the next step toward finding some balance.

I'm curious to hear if anyone else has faced similar challenges or has experiences to share."

192g35v,Anxiety,2024-01-09,Please i need help or at least suggestions how i can overcome this trauma.,"27 F
A trauma caused by my father. 
Back when i was a kid my father would always shout or pull and shot a gun anywhere if he losses temper, and it happened many times. It started when i was around 6 y/o, I remember if he goes home late and drunk i would hide because of fear and i would always pray to God that one day  my father’s behaviour will change. He wouldn’t hurt us but the trauma he is giving me is something i can’t take especially the fear. 

March2017 my graduation in college, we invited friends and relatives even our neighbours for a celebration. That time he stopped already drinking liquor, but they got a fight with his brother and again he losses temper. Instead of hurting his brother he pull a gun and shot it in above direction. 

Everyone was panicking, there i started trembling with fear and crying. Not only it caused embarrassment but also another trauma in my life. After this, I noticed my self that I easily get nervous over silly things and i would sometimes feel like me my heart beats fast if i see or hear him mad. 

Just a year ago, I talked to him about this. Fortunately my father changed like 3years ago. But still I’ve got the trauma. My father would join fire shooting competition so i ask him since I’m very scared of gun, I wanted to try it to at least overcome this fear and try using it. So far it helped me, that every time i see him with a gun Im not afraid anymore. 

But now, my problem is i would still dream of it from time to time. Last time i dreamt of it is just an hour ago when i took a nap. There are also times that i would hear myself crying in the middle of my sleep specially if in my dream my father is shooting someone. The worst thing a dreamed before is he took the life of my brother from shooting him. 😭😭 

Do i need to go to psychiatrist now? Or is there any way it can help me overcome this? Thank you in advance. ❤️"
192frit,Anxiety,2024-01-09,Weird anxiety feeling tied to stomach problems,"Hello, 

  
I made this post trying to find someone with similar symptoms as I have. So back in august I had H. Plyori infection. It really affected my health and my first time in my life I had anxiety which was connected to the condition. I was taking the medication for a month and then it got away. It was all good but in the last month I kinda get the similar feeling sometimes when I eat certain food. I got tested yesterday for H. pylori and the test was negative. Also, I did a blood test and the blood is perfect, nothing was off. 

  
Yesterday in the evening I ate some ice cream and that weird anxiety/confusion/brain fog feeling came back. I was outside with my friends and even when I got back to my bed it was still like that. If someone had similar experience with certain food affecting their mood, or if you think it's something else I would like to hear your advice. My doctor today didn't really help me, he said it could be ""stress"" and ""bad diet"" but I'm not someone who is stressed a lot.

  
I was thinking it may be gastritis since my mother has it or it may be Hypochlorhydria?

  
Anyways, thanks for help!"

For the past 2 years, I have been unable to workout properly for more than say, 20 to 30 minutes at best. After a few sets, the anxiety kicks in: feels like my heart is pounding (my garmin watch says my HR is \~120 for example, which is not that high after having completed a set of chest or whatever...

I know 120 is a normal HR when you're lifting weight, but the feeling in the chest is there. I don't know how to describe it... the heart rate is normal, but the strenght of each pound seems bigger... like my blood pressure was going through the roof. Then I get anxious, a bit dizzy, tired and scared to the point I can't lift anymore.

It's debilitating, really. And I can't deal with it anymore. I tried meditation, stretching, the exercise where you place your hands behind your head and look to my 3 pm until my parasympathic system kicks in... none of this stuff works.

I drove home years ago and took a few small hits of a joint during my drive. I smoke weed almost everyday but this strain had been giving me some paranoia which was very unusual. Anyways, i took a few hits and became paranoid very quickly and got scared that i was driving on a freeway at night while paranoid. I considered pulling over but didnt and drove the rest of the way home (3-4 hours). 

When i got home i checked the car for dents or scratches but there were none. For the next few days i was very anxious that i possibly hit someone while driving or caused an accident although my memory has no recollection of anything like this happening. 

I forgot about this driving session for awhile but now the memory of driving high has come roaring back and im very scared that i might have done something wrong. I start therapy in a couple days for what i think is severe anxiety (not just about this driving thing but lots of other things as well) but wondering what you all think of this situation. Can being paranoid cause memory loss such that i dont remember hitting a pedestrian or other car on a freeway at night? Thanks."

Also, I have no car and live in a small country town AND I do work (just not 30 hours a week, NOBODY at my job works those hours a week, it’s a small business). I call Social Services, wait 30 minutes in a queue, get a person, get transferred, then another person, get transferred again, and then that person doesn’t even pick up. I anxiously leave a voice mail. I get a call 5 hours later, this woman says to ignore the paperwork cause they “send it out to everyone.”

Now, I know most people have different worries but isn’t that strange that Social Services deliberately sends out paperwork to *everyone* despite not knowing if said paperwork will cause said person to have a panic attack? How is this “helping” anyone? These big companies and organizations always say they are “here to help” and whatever they believe but they are only here to cause people to get anxiety and give up on the whole process altogether.

The above was this morning, I go all day and I check the mail and now my partner has gotten a letter from social services saying that I “left the household” even though I did not, I simply want my *own* benefit card with *my* SNAP/ Foodstamps on it so it’s easier then juggling around one card! So now I have to call Social Services again in the morning and explain it to them like they are five that I do, in fact, still live at my current address and that I simply want my own benefit card (like I’ve told them three times now). I’ve even told them I have anxiety and one of my anxious feelings is talking on the phone. It’s just so frustrating and I hate it that I even bothered going for SNAP/ foodstamps now, non-stop stress!

1928i4e,Anxiety,2024-01-09,My anxiety is a bit climatic,"Like the Big Bang Theory episode when Sheldon thinks he has appendicitis.  I'm the same way with my nausea.

19287we,Anxiety,2024-01-09,Had a panic attack in a certain situation now I can’t enjoy that situation anymore..,"I just need to rant for a second. 

I have struggled with GAD and a panic disorder my whole life. 

I have been on multiple medications to try and help. They help for a short while but then poop out so then I have to switch to something else… 

Anyways. I currently take Viibryd 40mg and it’s been meh. Not great but not terrible. 

I was on a walk in my neighborhood a few weeks ago, all of a sudden, I get a panic attack out of nowhere (I could feel it building up) and I started to panic on my walk?? My heart rate reached 185 after I started to panic and started running (idk why I did this, I was trying to get back to my house to try and calm down) so I’m sure that has something to do with the increased heart rate, but now I don’t wanna go on a walk in my neighborhood anymore cause I’m so uncomfortable and nervous it’ll happen again. I feel on edge now when I try to walk in my neighborhood, and it’s cause I think I’m scared I’m gonna have a panic attack again?? I went on walks since then but I’ve been on edge every single time and I can’t go for the long walk so used to due to the anxiety? 

I have no problem working out in the morning tho at my gym, it’s just this specific situation I think. I notice I get kinda nervous after taking my Viibryd so I’m wondering if that has anything to do with it."
19287hz,Anxiety,2024-01-09,should i be concerned?,"i was always told i may potentially have a disassociation disorder due to experiencing fazes of loosing touch with reality but i’ve noticed that i have a problem occasionally whenever i get in a car i randomly get slight pressure in my head my eyes start to close slightly like im about to pass out, and my vision gets slightly darkens. also get slightly numb in my hands and legs. it only happens when im in a car (since being in a car gives me a lot of anxiety) but somtimes randomly and it doesent seem to matter what im doing.
should i be concerned, does anyone have any idea what it could be and what i should do about it?
i dont know if this information is needed but i deal with really bad anxiety it hit me out of nowhere and i’ve been dealing with it for the last year, and i smoke nicotine im accully quiting tomorow and these symptoms only really affect me whenever i was smoking. i quit for like 7 months and got caught back up into it and all these symptoms started again (the slight passing out and random bursts of anxiety)"
192862f,Anxiety,2024-01-09,death anxiety? life crisis,"i’m so scared to die. every now and then i think about this and it consumes my life for a while. i’m not scared of it hurting or anything. what i’m scared of is not existing. i know i shouldn’t worry because i won’t know and it will be nothing but i hate the fact that one day i will not be me. i will be nothing and that terrifies me. what is the point of anything then? why am i here? i hate it so much and it gives me so much anxiety and i can’t think about anything else. i know i should enjoy life while i can but what even is the point when none of this means anything? time goes so fast. i feel like just yesterday i was a little kid and now i’m already about to be graduating high school and going off to college. i’m finally the age i always dreamed of being when i young and i just wish i could go back. i don’t want my life to be over the next time i blink my eyes. i’m so mad at the world for giving us so little time to be here. i know sometimes life can suck but i feel like i take it for granted. even through the most horrible and devastating experiences i’ve had, i was still here, alive. i was me. i cannot fathom how one day i will no longer be me. i will be nothing. all that will be left of me are memories that will slowly slip away. and then it will be as if i was never even here to begin with. i know that’s all my ego talking. the more i think about it maybe i’m so deeply afraid of dying because i don’t want to be forgotten…but how am i supposed to get over that? i feel like there’s nothing more human than fearing your existence being erased. i know i will never be important enough to be in the history books but even if i was…every book, every page will someday whither away. one day the sun will die out and we will all die a slow cold death. and there’s nothing we can do about it. this makes me think about bugs. how silly and unimportant they seem to us. but they are living life just like us. maybe they fear death as well. maybe everyday before they go off they hug their bug friends and tell them to be careful not to be stepped on. what about bugs make them any less important than us? why are their lives less meaningful than ours? i wish i didn’t think so much. sometimes i think if i was just oblivious to the world that i would be much happier. imagine how peaceful it would be to not read into the lines of everything. i wish i could just accept that i will die one day for how it is. i can’t accept it. maybe it’s because i apply meaning to everything. everything has to have a purpose right? human life has to be apart of something so much bigger, right? but maybe there is no meaning and that terrifies me. maybe we were just a species that evolved and accidentally gained self-awareness. maybe we are just here to procreate and die. if that’s the case i wish society didn’t force us to work everyday and become a part of this system. how beautiful it would be to just wake up in a field of grass and decide that today you will go pick strawberries. i wish i could live in a world where money and jobs didn’t exist. a world where you didn’t have to have a “purpose”, you could just be. i never know how to explain that to people. i just want to be. i don’t want to go into a certain field or career, i don’t want to live the same never-ending life everyday. i want to be everything simultaneously. i want to create films. and i want to write romance novels. and i want to live in france and eat cute little desserts at a cafe. i want to marry a handsome man and have 3 kids who i love dearly. and i want to be single and free my whole life and travel the world. i want to be a lawyer and carry a cute little briefcase to work everyday and i want to save someone’s life because i am a passionate and focused surgeon. i want to live every life at once and it is impossible..it reminds me of a quote from the bell jar. “I saw my life branching out before me like the green fig tree in the story. From the tip of every branch, like a fat purple fig, a wonderful future beckoned and winked. One fig was a husband and a happy home and children, and another fig was a famous poet and another fig was a brilliant professor, and another fig was Ee Gee, the amazing editor, and another fig was Europe and Africa and South America, and another fig was Constantin and Socrates and Attila and a pack of other lovers with queer names and offbeat professions, and another fig was an Olympic lady crew champion, and beyond and above these figs were many more figs I couldn't quite make out. I saw myself sitting in the crotch of this fig tree, starving to death, just because I couldn't make up my mind which of the figs I would choose. I wanted each and every one of them, but choosing one meant losing all the rest, and, as I sat there, unable to decide, the figs began to wrinkle and go black, and, one by one, they plopped to the ground at my feet.” this so perfectly describes me and how i feel. i feel like i’m so focused on giving my life meaning that in the end it will have none. all i have is potential that is being wasted. every hobby that i’ve taken up that i give up on in 2 weeks. every passion i’ve let burn out because it was too hard. why can’t i stick to anything? sometimes i wish i didn’t feel so deeply but i know that ultimately it makes me who i am. i am someone who feels deeply. and part of me feels like i should be happy about that. i should be happy that the life i was given, i get to feel deeply in. and if this is the only life i will be given, then i am grateful that i was me. maybe i’m so scared to die because deep down i feel like i’m meant to do something important. i feel different. i don’t feel like anyone else in my family or any of my friends. maybe that sounds self-centered but i don’t feel it in the way that’s putting them down. they are all special in their own way. i just feel like the odd one out. i feel like there’s something significantly different about myself but i can’t put my finger on it. i just hope that life means something in the end. reincarnation comforts me. just the thought of me being able to live out every single one of my fantasies comforts me. i could be everything. if that’s true then i shouldn’t worry about who i should be in this life because it wouldn’t really matter then. if i get to live every life for eternity then i will be happy to die. because it will not be death, it will be rebirth. part of me really believes in reincarnation because sometimes i can feel the weight of my past lives. sometimes when i talk to people i feel that i have known them before. i know that in a past life they were my friend or family member, or even my partner. and i wonder if they can feel it too. sometimes you just click with people and yeah maybe it’s just personality’s lining up or maybe it’s a coincidence but it can’t be."
1927z7f,Anxiety,2024-01-09,My journey,"I always promised myself that once I get all the tests done then I would leave a message on here for those who struggle with health anxiety. This all started when I had a stomach bug, I did a cat scan of my abdomen and they said I was backed up and took that as blockage in my colon causing me to be backed up because I was using the bathroom fairly often.. anyway I googled my symptoms at the time it was stomach noises, frequent bathroom use and my stool kept changing. I googled and my symptoms matched up perfectly with colon cancer, after that I developed a host of other symptoms that won’t get into but needless to say these symptoms matched up with colon cancer perfectly. Anyway I was freaking out going to the ER almost everyday begging for a colonoscopy I was crying every night. Finally did my colonoscopy all they found was gastritis and after that my symptoms magically disappeared literally a day later. After that I developed twitching and I googled again and google lead me to ALS and I spiralled again convinced this was what I had I started noticing dents on parts of my body and I drove myself mad again.. l did the  test nothing was wrong. All this stress I think caused me to develop insomnia and I googled again and found what they call fatal insomnia it did a sleep study and it showed everything was normal. I still battle with dealing with this whole sleep thing but I’m trying my best not to spiral as much as I use to. I wrote all this to say that health anxiety is terrible and it will ruin your life but remember that sometimes this is all in our heads.

1927nvi,Anxiety,2024-01-09,16M really worried,"
So with severe health anxiety I often switch between things and Health issues sometimes I come back to one sometimes I just leave it behind and jump to a new one. 

So this week it’s been about chest/respiratory infections, pneumonia, bronchitis those kinds of things after I got 5 nosebleeds in 4 days and got it followed up with TONS of chest nose and throat symptoms that don’t feel normal. I think it’s a combination of a chest infection a respiratory infection nasal irritation and acid reflux. Some of the most worrying symptoms I face are overproduction of SO MUCH mucus and snot it’s crazy. I’ve “choked” on it a little bit but not to total suffocation. 

Questions:

-is it possible to suffocate or choke on secretions from like acid and mucus to death while awake or sleeping?what do I see stories about people passing out from the exact same thing even when they’re young and just have normal congestion?

- if a full airway obstruction(can’t cough can’t breathe can’t make sound)does occur what would I do? Would I just have to you know just die? Would leaning forward or something in this case work?"

Also these days all I do is work and spend time with my family, maybe that is the other reason as I do not want them to worry. The past year I've travelled a lot and that didn't happen to me at all. Maybe I should also consider the stuff I hear and read about Palestine and Israel as well, I know that Morocco is not close, but still."
1927eci,Anxiety,2024-01-09,"I felt at peace for the first time in a long time, despite circumstances that threw me for a loop, and now it’s coming back","I had surgery on 1/5 that I’d been deeply anxious about for about a month and a half. When I was there, I surprisingly didn’t feel much anxiety (my mom was there with me and I was taking lots of notes of what was happening so I could make a Reddit post for those who were like me and had anxiety). The surgery went fine, healing has begun, and my mom was with me for 2.5 days afterwards. 

She went home yesterday and I could feel the generalized anxiety creeping back in. I’ve been alone all day (I live alone) and it’s back to an almost panic level. I just feel safer, more secure, more supported with a person *here*. Not just with the surgery recovery, but in general. My brother was here for a few days during the holidays before the surgery and he just made it so clear that he cared about me and we had fun. 

My mom won’t be back until Wednesday (2 days from now), and I just feel so alone. I grew up in a household of 5, but then my parents divorced and shaved that population to 4. We all grew up and now my brother lives in Florida and my twin sister is in California. My dad now lives in Alabama while my mom and I are in Ohio, 45 minutes away from each other. 

What the hell is someone supposed to do to not be so anxious with the lack of people living with them? It’s not like I’m in danger when they’re gone, it just feels like I’m taken care of and loved more when they’re physically with me. I have friends but barely see them in person. I’m almost too anxious to go out and meet people who could be there for me in person. I’m probably just tired from healing and lack of sleep because of that but I’m also trying not to dismiss my feelings and accept them as valid, in which case I’m back to asking how someone can feel less anxious when they rely on the presence of other people to not be so anxious?"

Anyways, I feel like today was miserable. I didn't know anyone there which was to be expected, but me approaching people and saying HI became sooooo awkward. And I was so nervous the whole time. What didn't help my nerves was me being in bracket.

My first match I won, but then in the second one it came to my attention it would be livestreamed in twitch and throughout the arcade. I became so nervous to the point I was almost gonna have a panic attack.

And I was versing a well known professional in the game. I got absolutely destroyed and humiliated. I even heard people gasping and excited when he was destroying me from the other room.

After that I continued playing losers, lost in the next game and stayed for a while before leaving.

I dropped out of my major in college, I was lucky to graduate. I started a job after graduating, I quit after one month. I just gave notice at my old job that I want to move on from - oh wait, I'm too much of a coward to go on a limb and push myself for something more - so I begged them to take me back.

  
The part that seals my fate is that for me is that I always have an out. When I am forced to face my fear of failure, my life is torture. I can't sleep, I can't eat, every waking moment is just anxiety that rocks me to my core. But if I walk away from my stressor? Poof! I get instant relief. It slowly gets replaced by depression and lethargy, but it beats having to face the possibility of not being good enough, because at least I can say I'm not even trying.

  
It's like being locked in a room where I can always knock on the door and know it will be unlocked for me when I decide I can't take it anymore. Sometimes I wish I could find that room I could lock myself in and not get out of, so I could learn to face what's inside or die."

I had a small anxiety attack this morning and took a little of my emergency propanalol ( I’m prescribed 10mg, but I broke the pill and only took like 3mg). That was at like 9:30 am and I felt off all day afterwards. So I went to cityMD at 6pm and got a checkup and EKG. All was fine in the checkup but doc told me not to drink tonight. 

The issue is that I’m a pretty heavy drinker, I have at least two or three large glasses of red wine every night if not more. If I don’t have any wine tonight I’m worried I might have withdrawal symptoms that will make my anxiety worse, but I also don’t wanna mix downers and potentially make things worse.

I would go to the washroom and pee and as soon as I left, I felt like I would need to go pee again. And it’s been quite constant… pretty much all day, everyday. I just feel like I have to pee. So I went to ER thinking maybe UTI… Test results were negative. But they did find blood (microscopic hemocura) in fact, they looked at all my previous urine test results dating back to September 2022… They found all 4 tests that were dating back to September 2022 were positive for blood. So I went to see my doctor who then tested again… same thing negative for UTI but positive for blood. So I am currently waiting for ultrasound for my bladder and kidney. I had one done a few years ago for other reasons which was normal, but I know stuff can change quickly. I’m having no pains, doesn’t hurt to have sex, none of that. I do notice when I drink water, I feel the urge to go more commonly (sometimes barley anything has came out because I just went 10 minutes prior) I know kidney stones can be a possibility but I’ve had no pains, no fevers… my main concerns is why I’ve been bleeding for so long, pretty much a year and half now. And why do I keep feeling the urge to pee 24/7. Those are literally my only symptoms…. My doctor put me on nitrofurition (UTI medication) he says that it may help me stop the urge in the meantime while waiting to find out what this is… but it’s really not helping… does anyone have any ideas on what this could be?

I've had this really bad itch for about 5-6 years now and the main areas it affects are around my scalp, sides/back of my head, and also around my upper back. Scratching it usually just makes it worse and more intense. The itch usually happens whenever I feel stressed/anxious, such as simply being out in public, as I have social anxiety and always worry about other people looking at me or judging me. Doing anything physically intensive also triggers the itch, such as running, lifting weights, or simply just lifting anything even remotely heavy in general, and this happens whether I'm alone or in public at a gym. The itch usually only goes away once I stop feeling stressed/anxious, like for example if I start itching in public, it goes away once I get in the car and I'm alone. One thing to note that's important but really weird about the itch is that it happens all throughout the year but then it goes away **completely** from around the end of May up until the beginning of November, and this happens consistently every single year since the itch first started happening. No matter what I do or what situation I'm in during this period of time, the itch never happens but once it's past that period, it starts happening again without fail. 

I've tried searching online to see if anyone else has had the exact same experience as me and also for any remedies but I haven't been able to find anything. It's just so difficult for me to function and do things normally with this itch but I have no idea what to do about it and I don't know if it's some sort of condition or health related, or if it's just something simple. If anyone knows of any possible ways to fix my itch, please let me know because I just want to be able to do things normally for once"
1923vlq,Anxiety,2024-01-09,Horrible Anxiety Attacks (hospitalization),"My anxiety has started to get out of control. 

Most of the time it starts from feeling like I can't completely catch my breath or I get the weird dizziness in my head almost like the room is moving around me and I'm going to lose balance. From there heart pounds super hard, my hands and/or feet will fall asleep completely and feel numb and weak and I feel like I can't walk or talk right. I will get all sweaty and pale and intense feelings of something is seriously wrong with me. The ambulance will come and they always admit me to the hospital because my heart rate shows 150s-180s and increased BP. They never find anything wrong and cardiologist has ruled out anything major but they did find out I have {PACS} Premature Atrial contractions which are super mild and not threatening.  I also will wake up out of my sleep most nights 5-10 times with immediate panic that I'm dying or having a heart attack or cant breathe. 

Has anyone experienced anything similar? Has anyone found triggers that make anxiety worse and things to help them occur less. I feel like I'm losing control of my own body "
1923v2y,Anxiety,2024-01-09,not sure what to do,"Just going to start off by saying I (23F) struggle really badly with anxiety, depression, and PTSD from family and their substance abuse. Lately it's gotten much much worse as my dad relapsed on drugs and my mom copes with alcohol and my siblings cope with weed. Anyways, I started IOP treatment last Thursday in hopes it will help with my anxiety. My boyfriend (25M) of 10 months has been so supportive. We do get in little arguments and we had one bad experience that we sorted out really well but we have never actually fought badly until today. We were eating out before he had to go to work and we didn't have a lot of time. For treatment my homework was to tell someone in my support system the things I have learned and ask it they can add to my list of things I fear and things I avoid. I asked him and he just gave me a look like I have so many avoidances that he didn't even know where to begin. Naturally this made me cry bc it was overwhelming to see that he probably feels overwhelmed and thinks I have so many things that I am afraid of and it just felt like a harsh judgement of where I'm at in life. He said sorry but it made me feel so awful. He had to go to work and I called him on the way there to try to sort it out and to hopefully make me feel better. Well he was obviously frustrated and raised his voice and told me that I flake too much bc of my anxiety and he just wants to tell me to suck it up because if i wanted to actually get better, I would, and it wouldn't be so hard. I hung up on him bc those are quite literally the worst things someone could say to me in regard to my mental health. My friends aren't emotional people and aren't the most supportive and my family all struggles with similar stuff as well as things I don't want to be apart of. I'm feeling so down and i lost some trust for him. He has never said anything like that to me hefore and now l'm questioning every time he has been patient, kind, compassionate, and understanding even though he has no idea what im dealing with. Like is this the real him or is it just too much now? I'm scared I deal with too much that he can't handle. I'm scared we have to break up bc what if it gets worse and he begins to hate me more and more because he cant take all this away from me and it stresses him out? Idk. I'm rambling. We're texting about it now but he's working. Half of me wants to just end it and the other half wants to make up. Any support would be nice."

But the more I study, the darker my world view becomes. The world has become so big and interwoven that changing something and for it to actually have an effect on the environment, the scale of humans and countries that need to work together is huge. We can't even keep a third world war from happening at the moment, how will we solve something as complex as the environmental crisis?

I see no hope for humanity. And I no longer see a purpose in my studies, since I feel that no matter what I'll do in my lifetime, how much or little I fight for the environment and for humanity it will all go to heck anyways.

194oh87,Anxiety,2024-01-12,Am I manifesting a bad digestion cycle?,"Warning now for a very TMI conversation about bowel movements:

Basically, I’ve been dealing with some on and off sensitive digestion for about a month now and I’m trying not to let my health anxiety make it worse. I haven’t had that many digestive issues historically, though my occasional instances of urgent diarrhea did get more frequent when my anxiety increased. I started becoming more aware of my bowel movements after learning that someone I followed on insta had ulcerative colitis (and learning about all that entails), which made me a little more nervous whenever I had loose stools. Then, about a year ago, I had a huge health anxiety flare up when there was an out of range result on my blood test (it ended up being nothing), which totally threw my digestion out of whack and caused severe constipation followed by loose stools. This ended up freaking me out so much that I lost my appetite for a solid week, which was the scariest thing ever. I went to the doctor, though I didn’t end up getting extensive tests done because the symptoms just went away on their own. For the rest of the year everything was totally fine health and digestion wise, until the middle of December when my fiancé and I both got diarrhea from eating ramen. I was kind of worried about it because we had an event to go to the next day, so I took a loperamide and it was fine. But then a few days later, loose stools again. Not like ‘full on watery, more than three times a day’ type of thing, just not solid. And since then, it’s been off and on like that. I kind of stressed about it all month because we had constant things to do, and I wasn’t sure if it would ever come a point when it would be urgent. I would get nervous about it every time we had to get in the car or eat a heavy meal. The longer I’ve gone without consistent solid stools, the more anxious I’ve gotten. Nervous bowels (I guess you’d call it ibs) run in my family, so I’m fairly sure that’s what it is, but I’m having trouble breaking myself out of the cycle of worrying about it (and trying to convince myself that it’s not ibd or something more serious).

Today I tried, I went on my final, I was on my way and the weather was horrible and as much as I dreaded all of it-I still went.

And suddenly EVERYTHING went wrong. The world seemed very unusual and scary. The buildings looked scarily huge, too many people, too many voices, too many cars…our car was moving too fast as well…and I begged my aunt to take me back home and so she did.

I feel like a complete idiot, like a complete failure. I have an appointment with a psychotherapist booked in 2 days and hopefully I will get on meds or something because I am incapable of pushing through at this point.

I started to develop anxiety because of noisy neighbors with 3 children. The sound of children running and people talking loudly drives me crazy. It's been about 6 months now. 

I'm moving in another apartment in about 3.5 months, but I'm realizing that my health is getting worse and worse. Even at work, when I think about going back to my apartment, I get very anxious ... at night, I find it hard to sleep when there's no noise, but I have the impression that there is ...

193ddj0,Anxiety,2024-01-10,Can’t tell if my heart is okay or not.,"So for some back story I developed agoraphobia august 2022. I stopped leaving my house and pretty much did nothing all day. I gained 30 pounds in like 4-5 months which is a little concerning to me( I was already a little bit overweight so now I guess I’m considered obese). By like May 2023 I was sitting in my bed all day. I have a crochet business so I’d just crochet all day and barely leave my room. I left my house a total of 2 times in 2023. 

Fast forward to now. I’ve changed my diet, I’m in a calorie deficit and I’m trying to exercise. But here’s the thing, I feel like it might be too late for my heart. My resting rate is anywhere from 70-90 just kind of depends how I’m feeling. When i get up my heart rate will jump 30+ beats. I’ve noticed when I’m standing my heart rate is usually around 102 which slightly worries me because that’s a little high. I have a waking pad and have been walking daily for a couple days now and I’ve noticed my heart rate. I walked on speed 3 for 10 minutes and my heart rate was 150 when I got off. After about a minute it was at 120 and then it slowly went back down to 102ish. 

The weird thing is I feel like I don’t get out of breath really my heart just beats fast. After walking for 10 minutes (might not seem like a lot but I was averaging like 500 steps per day before) I could breathe fine but my heart like I said was beating fast. I don’t know if this is normal for someone who is very sedentary or if I should consider seeing a doctor. I still have agoraphobia and have trouble leaving my house but I’m hoping the exercise will maybe help with that a little. 

I did get labs done by my doctor back in August and everything was normal but that was about 5 months ago so who knows if I’m still healthy or not. All I know is I need to lose weight and honestly I already feel better about myself after I’ve started walking. I’m getting about 7-7500 steps a day, I’ll work up to 10000. But I literally went from 500-1000 steps to pretty much 7 times that within a day. 

I have a few other symptoms/ things I’ve noticed (unrelated to my heart) that make me wonder if something is going on. But my doctor isn’t taking me seriously so I’m kinda at a loss."

I understand there is lots of information out there to help support. However, I found that when I was at my lowest points, I either did not have the capacity to understand any of the information or did not want to spend my very little energy searching around the internet.   
I am not trying to self promote here. I am only trying to share a channel I have created, hopefully gaining an audience where they can understand they are not on their own. I have created videos which talk of my disorders as well as others, factors that lead to our disorders, self help tips and coping mechanisms that help me tackle my battles.   
I also offer support by signposting you to the correct medical health you need. Making it much easier for you. This means so much more to people, as it is engaging and relatable.

192w92z,Anxiety,2024-01-10,Panic attack from hearing two noises at once?,"Hi! I started getting panic attacks in late December. Common story y’all have heard 1 million times: first one had me thinking I needed to go to the hospital because I didn’t know what was happening, panicked even more because of that, ended up in a strong panic and adrenaline cycle etc. Took me a couple hours to get out of it. 

I’ve had a few more since that first one, and I’ve gotten better at managing them because 
I logically know what’s happening now and can kind of talk myself through it. 

I’ve been trying to identify potential triggers. I know one is my father…just in general. So I do try to limit my direct contact with him. I thought alcohol might be inducing them, so I stopped drinking. But they’re still happening.

My last one occurred tonight and it was a weird scenario: I am visiting my parents. I was watching Jeopardy with my mom. In the next room, my father started watching the news loudly on his phone. Hearing two different shows, two distinct conversation threads happening at once made my brain just like…very unhappy. And the panic attack began. It was milder and shorter - only about 10-15 minutes total - but definitely present. This has also almost happened before when someone had the TV volume too loud. 

I’ve always been sensitive to noise, but not to the point of literal panic. I also have no problem at places that are SUPPOSED to be loud - like crowded restaurants, concerts, or sports arenas.

192e3jh,Anxiety,2024-01-09,"Dry mouth, constricted sinuses","Hey everyone 

I have been dealing with hefty anxiety for a couple of years due to separate health conditions (chronic pain). Alongside the anxiety, I at some point began developing a chronic dry mouth as well as constricted sinuses i.e. hard to breathe through my nose, but no mucus. 

I’ve spoken to my doctor about this and we have tried a few things such as nasal sprays, irrigation, allergy meds, etc. but nothing has made any difference. 

I’m wondering now if this overall dryness may be caused by my anxiety - and if anyone has ever experienced something similar. 

Due to my pain and the effect that has on many aspects of my life, I would say I am very often, if not always, in a state of ‘flight’ (palpitations, sweats, shaking). Are these symptoms just my body reacting and diverting priority to other bodily functions because of this? 

I’m pretty stumped here. Keen to hear any thoughts and anecdotes you all may have :)"
192ddrk,Anxiety,2024-01-09,First day of school n horrible anxiety,"So, I recently got back to school yesterday, and I had gotten no sleep whatsoever (which probably contributed to this anxiety attack because cortisol and whatnot). I got up at six, couldn't eat, then got a lump in my throat, which made me think I was gonna throw up. I got on the bus, the lump hadn't gone away, and I felt really nauseous. Got to school, still the same.

My first period, my heart was a little fast sitting, but getting up was horrible. It was so fast, and I was scared. I was still nauseous and had bad thoughts like thinking I was gonna die or throw up—absolutely horrible. It didn't get much better 2nd period, although I had a ton of friends. Even then, I still had anxiety, so I just fell asleep.

3rd period was the same dreadful nauseous feeling, fixed only by sleeping. I had lunch, and man, I was going through it. Keep in mind I just gave up all my friends to get closer to Christ. I was sitting alone, and man, the thoughts I was having were horrible—just constant ""you have no friends,"" ""nobody likes you or cares about you."" But that's probably just anxiety and sleep deprivation at its peak, to be honest. My heart was still racing, so to calm myself down, I was taking walks and stuff periodically. People talked to me but laughed when I was boring and just said hi; people are so rude for no reason sometimes.

4th period, man, was pretty easy. I had many distractions like a test I hadn't done, and we watched a movie. But 5th period might've been the absolute worst. Before winter break on the last day, we had finals, and I threw up in my 5th period. Man, coming back was horrible. My anxiety was at its peak, my heart was racing, I felt the horrible feeling of impending doom, my hands were sweaty, my feet cold, and nauseous too. Horrible, I wouldn't wish this on anyone, I overcame it though just by waiting but even then it was horrible.

6th period didn't help; I still had some of that anxiety. But I talked to this one stoner girl I knew, she probably has panic attacks frequently because she smokes a ton of carts and gets really high so she got really good tips, but anyways I calmed myself down, took a little nap, and it helped. Honestly, I think all of this was just my sleep deprivation and anxiety—not a great combo at all. My phone had died at school, and I had no distractions, so just me and my anxiety. It's dreadful. At least I skipped today; my mom made the excuse that the weather was bad, but I know that she just wants me to rest. I told her about yesterday; she got so worried for me. She's a genuinely good mom but can't help me that much due to a language barrier and the fact that my Medicaid expired, and we are poor, so no going to doctors nor psychiatrists, lol."
1927bu8,Anxiety,2024-01-09,Persistent anxiety,"I had a pretty intense year last year, including stress, anxiety and health scares. 
It's left it's mark on me and I can't seem to shift it.

When everything first happened, I had a month off work, and going back to work felt like torture, a continuous cycle of feeling severe panic would happen all day on and off, what felt like every 5 minutes. 

I'm much better now, but there is a lingering sense that I'm not ok, and still have pretty bad anxiety most days. I can't stop focusing on it and checking if I'm back to ""normal"" again every time I wake up and throughout the day. This is obviously keeping it alive.

I have been doing mindfulness meditation to try and help, which has at times, but I think I've been overthinking it pretty badly, and subconsciously judging myself if I'm not present.

I always tend to dive into things 110% and I think I've done that with meditation, normally I would distract myself if I feel anxious, but meditation kind of tells you that that is just hiding from it and doesn't solve the issue, so I guess I'm just ""aware"" of it all the time and I don't know if that's the right or wrong thing to do 😣. 

I know the fear of it not going away is strong, which keeps it there, and I don't know what to do next. I'm getting so exhausted trying to deal with it.

On top of this, I've been reading about the nature of human existence and reality, sort of based around Buddhism and spirituality and normally I would enjoy that, but I think it just makes me anxious about reality and that nobody really knows what it is, and how it can slip away at any point. I think I might have some derealization from the really intense stress and anxiety from last year too. So yeah, all of that plus existential anxiety.

Has anyone had anything similar or any advice on how to deal with it?

Thank you for your time."

It’s only happened when I’m driving other people or when I’m on a flight 

It’s like there’s a sense of extreme heat that rises through my body, mostly concentrated in my abdomen. The feeling of anxiety is very high as the heat passes upwards through me until it entirely goes. The whole thing probably lasts less than 30 seconds.  

For the avoidance of any doubt I’m nowhere near the age for hot flashes etc.

19220rw,Anxiety,2024-01-09,"How do you all handle new, stressful situations? I'm really struggling and need advice","DISCLAIMER: I know you all aren't therapists, and I'm not here seeking therapy. I already have a therapist. I'm just trying to get as many ideas from as many people as possible.

Hey everyone, I would really appreciate some help with some stress I'm going through right now. I'm going to provide some context and then explain the issues I'm experiencing. I know this is going to be really long, but I implore you to read this because I'm struggling! I have a therapist, but an outside perspective would really help. Everyone here has struggled with stress and anxiety. Have any of you had a similar situation? How do you cope?

Context/background: 
I started a new job a couple of months ago, and I'm really struggling to manage the stress. I've had multiple (like maybe a dozen) ER and psychiatric hospitalizations due to stress-related crises, and a few of these crises have been due to stress related to previous jobs. It's been 16 months since my last hospitalization, and 2 months ago I decided I felt stable enough to pursue full-time employment after testing the waters with a part-time job for the previous 5 months. I told myself that I would not take on a job that seemed like there would be a lot of stress associated with it, that does not have a thorough and supportive training program, that does not offer support to employees, and that does not have effective communication and good rapport among employees. 

In my interview with this job, I expressed all of my needs and concerns and asked specific questions so I could make an informed decision that this company would be appropriate for me. I was assured by the 3 interviewers that they have an excellent, thorough, and supportive training process and that I would never be thrown into any situation that would make me feel uncomfortable or where I would be unprepared, that they won an award this past year for being one of the best places to work in the state with one of the best teams. I was also told I would get my own office.

The problem(s): 
This employer has broken every single promise from the first day I started. I've been thrown into a bunch of difficult situations I'm not prepared for after receiving no training or very little training. I share an office with an employee who started a week before me, and she's constantly taking personal calls in the office or asking me for help (yes, I wear noise-canceling headphones), so it's impossible to concentrate. She's also struggling so much that they've taken away responsibilities from her and given them to me. Certain team members will not communicate with me or do their jobs no matter how much I put forth the effort to facilitate things smoothly. All of my coworkers and my supervisor are passive-aggressive and act like I'm an idiot when I ask for help and make suggestions. The client population is also a difficult demographic to deal with, and I'm feeling completely unsupported, overwhelmed, and overworked. I'm being given more and more responsibilities with no support. Similar situations have happened to me, and I've had major issues coping in those situations. I'm only 16 months out from my last major crisis.

I don't feel like I can quit. They gave me a sign-on bonus that I will have to pay back if I quit or change positions within a year. This company is also a major player in my field in my very small local area, and the people who work there have connections with everybody else in the area, so I'm afraid that quitting this job could potentially lead to being blacklisted from other employment opportunities in the field. I have a spotty employment history and don't want to add another unsuccessful situation to my work history. I also think it's important for me to learn perseverance, and I don't want to quit any time things get tough.

How do I manage all of this stress and take care of myself? I see my therapist (who is an anxiety specialist) every two weeks, and I see my psychiatrist next month. I've been trying to practice self-care and have been journaling, meditating, reading, listening to music, and buying nice things for myself. Even with all of this stuff, I can't stop thinking about work 24/7. I have bad dreams and nightmares about work. I frequently feel on the verge of a panic attack. I've felt like crying even though I haven't cried in over a year. The stressful situations at work aren't going to ease up any time soon--they're actually going to get worse because I'm being given a lot of big, new responsibilities in the coming weeks.

What should I do to maintain my health? How can I prevent a crisis? How can I have a better work-life balance? How do I continue to force myself to come into work every day? I called out today because of the overwhelming stress. I have to go back tomorrow, but it feels so difficult. I don't want to end up in the hospital again, but the consequences of quitting feel really bad too. How can I do this?"

So I decided to try a cold shower, not ice cold but uncomfortable. I thought for sure I'd read 160/100, to my surprise it was 122/80. I measured it 3 times to be sure.

**WIND ADVISORY** for Tuesday afternoon until Wednesday morning.

**FLOOD WATCH** for roughly the same time period.

My main concern is the combination of heavy rain and strong winds which may cause power outages.  I always freak out when these types of storms threaten the area where I live.  Power outages make me hyperventilate, depending on how long they last.  My pulse rate skyrockets before a storm even arrives.  I often lose valuable sleep, and I don't sleep well as it is.

According to what I read, wind gusts are expected to reach 55 mph!  These gusts can trigger outages, even by themselves.  Add heavy rain and saturated ground, and they will only make things worse!  As if I don't have enough things that give me anxiety.  Now, I need to worry about this big rain and windstorm!  Why can't we have peaceful weather systems?  Why must they always be dangerous?!  The previous storm gave me bad anxiety, but this one sounds worse than the other one!

19208aj,Anxiety,2024-01-08,Embarrassing/Cringe-worthy memories wiping out my self esteem.,"I don’t know if this is common among people with anxiety or it’s just me, but I will have a memory of myself that was years ago or even a few months ago and just be completely horrified over the person I came off as. 

A lot of the memories are accompanied by something mean said by another person about me, where I’m in full agreement with what they said, that I was in fact being cringe or weird as fuck. Some memories I’ll just think that even if people didn’t say something mean, I was still being a loser and it’s self inflicted.

I’ll usually tell myself, hey maybe the people being mean were partially right and you did not have the best awareness at that point, and if anything it is a great learning opportunity. But the same memories keep coming up worse and worse. 

Normally this will happen and I’ll have a good self esteem going beforehand that day, but something will trigger the memory. Sometimes the bad memories can be triggered by something so small and trivial, like a simple word or a phrase, but my brain never fails to bring back the embarrassment that I felt in the memory.

It sucks, for example, this morning I woke up feeling energized and confident. I shared some coffee with my dad while having a nice conversation. Something he said brought up a certain embarrassing memory and it literally ruined my ability to socialize for the next hour or so. My dad was talking about something completely unrelated as well, but he used a single word that made me think of one embarrassing memory I have..? Literally just one word will do it.

191zx0h,Anxiety,2024-01-08,The palpitations are driving me mad,"17m, had em for 5 years and have driven my parents mad because they have done everything and still get them.

It started in middle school when i got a skipped beat while playing dodgeball and my heart went racing 200bpm. Nurses gave me water and got it down.

Ever since then I have been getting skipped beats daily and rare 1 or 2 episodes with the heart racing a year.

Cardiologist is not concerned and all my tests are good. I do not drink coffee or drink energy drinks.

What can I possibly do? What’s the next step?

I have made a post before here on reddit but I had a bunch of people telling me I got all these heart problems like svt or afib but my docs say I don’t have anything."

i think it’s anxiety but on the other hand it’s been over 5 hours now (got progressively better and shaking went away after 2-3hrs, left with dizzy feeling) so i’m wondering if i’m actually getting sick. ugh.

I’ve been struggling so hard to wake up and go to work. I know that once I’m there, I’ll be fine, but the build up to getting ready and head out the door is nearly impossible. I try to come up with every excuse I can to make it so I don’t have to go in and it’s starting to really affect my job. I am fairly new at the position I’m working at, and in the last 2.5 months, I’ve called out 4 times. They’re getting suspicious and I don’t know what to do. I dread going to the office more than anything else. I obsess about how I can get out of it. I’ve tried making goals to get myself to show up which works temporarily. I’ve tried medication. I’ve tried therapy. I’m afraid I’ll be fired for how bad it’s getting, but also that would relieve my anxiety to be fired. Not that I can afford to quit. I can’t even afford to be taking off the days I have been. But I cannot physically do it sometimes. Does anyone else struggle with this? How do you cope?"

Today, when I went to get the mail, I saw my neighbor’s cat was hunched up outside their front door. It’s currently about 20F where I live, so I knew they were very cold. I came inside and talked to my partner about it - as he has lived here longer than I have - and I asked him “what if I go talk to them?” He replied “they’ll laugh at you” — which hello, big fear! (please don’t judge him; he just knows they don’t take the best care of their animals and it’s an ongoing problem he’s tried to address before to no avail).

But I am so proud. I literally said “so what?”, and I put my boots on and went over and rang their doorbell. My neighbor answered the door and the cat ran right in. I said sorry for bothering her but her cat looked very cold, and she thanked me.

I wish we could do more for than animals. They don’t abuse them. But they haven’t taught their dog not to bark, which is annoying, because he does it incessantly. And their cat is mostly an outdoor cat, so sometimes she gets left outside for long periods. But I’m glad that I helped her today. She gave me a big meow when I walked up to her! 🙂"

I kept looking at my hands because they seemed so far away and like they were not mine. I ended up falling asleep but all day today I’ve still felt off. Things still look a little off but not nearly as bad. However I still feel a ton of panic, I feel myself sort of spiraling and I feel totally out of control. I keep worrying i’m going to go into psychosis or something worse. I also feel dumb, i keep forgetting things and doing things without realizing. Im just wondering if anyone knows what this is?

It has been a few months but I still don't feel quite at home in my new city. I am studying biology. But it is hard to make friends.

I joined a student and study association. Went to events. I met so much new people. But no new real friends. I don't know what I am doing wrong. Naturally I am an introvert, maybe ambivert. It takes me a lot of energy to go to events. I feel really tired afterward.

In my childhood I was bullied. Always the odd one out. I felt alone. I did not like the small town school. Never had a big friend group. I always had difficulty with making friends (I am diagnosed with a light form of autism&amp;ADD, therefore the social struggles). So I thought (hoped) at university I will have a big friend group. Unfortunately, I don't have a friend group yet. 

Probably overthinking it. I should give it some time. But maybe I suck at making friends.. It makes me feel so so insecure. About my looks, about my personality. I just don't feel relaxed around people. I feel stressed, lonely, insecure and unhappy. A big part of why I feel that way is that last year my dad died. His death had a really big impact on me.

I need advice. About making friends as a 21 year old. About accepting yourself. How to stay positive. How to keep hope. How do I grow up!?"

I need some support. It’s a long post but it’s been my life for the last 4 years, please read and try to give me some releaf from my misery.
I’m currently a Medical student and a former dental student. I’ve made a mistake. Dentistry has been my passion and I wanted to pursue that career, but I wasn’t ready to start studying (heavily depressed and confused during COVID and felt pressured by my friends and family to start studying) I started Dental school but I was so miserable at the time I blamed it strictly on the school and that it’s a shitty job to pursue. I saw that the grass is greener on the medical school side so I worked extremely (really fucking hard) and convinced myself this is what I wanted. After a few thousands of dollars I got accepted and moved to the medical program at my school. (I study in the middle east). After a year and after I got my shit together in life I understood the mistake I’ve made and the reasons why I made the change became clearer. I can go back to Dental school but I’m so fucking scared, how would my peers react for making the switch again, getting friends once again with new people, I’ll be doing 8 years of school and not 6 and see all my former classmates graduating 2 years before me and I’ll be almost 30 once completing dental school.

191wvei,Anxiety,2024-01-08,Switching meds and regretting it,"About 9 months ago, I started lexapro for debilitating anxiety. It took some time to get used to, but it worked perfectly after a month or so, and I found myself coming out of a depression I didn’t even know I was suffering from. However, about a month ago I noticed I was feeling depressed; having no interest in doing anything, feeling irritable and tired, withdrawing myself from the people around me, not wanting to play with my kids, etc. I’m a SAHM so the last part was big for us all, and I reached out to my provider to ask if I should up my dose. They instead changed my script to bupropion and I started it 4 days ago after weaning off the lexapro. I’ve been at a half dose (150mg) for that time, and my anxiety is worse every day. Today it feels like pure panic. I’m making up scenarios, have been convinced my children are dying and I don’t know about it, and just convinced myself my husband is leaving me (he’s not). This feels like the biggest mistake of my life right now. I feel exactly as constantly panicked as I did before I started lexapro and I don’t know how to live like this anymore. Now that I know life without this sense of doom, dread, and panic, I can’t stand living this way. Has anyone ever switched meds, experienced something similar?


TLDR; I’m switching from lexapro to bupropion per my provider’s advice because I had breakthrough depression and experiencing debilitating panic."

Need your advice please.,"**TLDR: Involuntarily moved to another role that I was unprepared for (and 100% would have not taken) that lead to a panic attack and development of anxiety disorder. Been trying to manage the anxiety ever since but feels stuck/lack of progress towards anxiety free life. Thinking about changing job but afraid the new job may make my anxiety worst.**  
  
  
  
Hi, I developed an anxiety disorder in 2021 and have been trying to manage it for the past 3 years. My feeling right now is my current job/company is the main driver. I feel like as long as I'm with this company, I will continue to have a disorder/dysfunction due to anxiety and need a change of scenery.  
  
Long story short, back in 2021 I was involuntarily switched to a brand new team and a new manager. The new role/team would be responsible for high-stakes work with the goal of savings the company millions of dollars. Its a very narrow line of work with all-in focus on cost savings analytical work. Prior to 2021, my work was very diverse and did not involve high stakes work. It was a complete change of work that I wasn't ready for.  
  
Here's a a timeline run-down of how things went:  
  
The other analyst brought into the new team changed jobs immediately (1 month after the team was formed). The person hired as the replacement changed jobs after a few months. This bullet is important because that leaves me as the only analyst doing the analyses, preparing PowerPoints, managing projects, and dealing with data issues (basically the role of 2-3 analysts). Another analyst was hired but guess what, that person decided to move to another role in our department less than 2 years after. Which again leaves me as the only analyst.  
  
One Friday in 2021, I had a meeting with my new manager to go over one of the project and there were questions/concerns about the data/#s. Apparently, one of my colleague (in the new team) was already sharing the #s even thought it was only in draft form (there was no discussions that this was ready to be shared). I had my first ever panic attack after the meeting that extended to Saturday and Sunday.  
  
Ever since that Friday 2021, I've been having very challenging battles with anxiety and trying to manage it. I wake up every morning with increased heart rate, thoughts about deadlines instantaneously raises my body temperature, constant rumination about work, and overall poor state of mind.  
  
I started seeing a mental health counselor in 2021. I went on anti-depressant in 2021 (I went off it since late 2022). I took the necessary steps to manage my anxiety disorder.  
  
Beginning 2023, I was moved to another team but would still be doing the same cost-savings work. So really no change in my mind.  
  
I've spoken openly to my new manager about my anxiety disorder and its challenges to me. I expressed desire to change my role in our 1x1 discussions and after \~10months, I will be finally off-loading some of my cost-savings work to another colleague. However, I'll still be working on a major cost-saving project that has a goal of saving millions of dollar. This is currently driving my anxiety (I just don't feel comfortable taking on this type of high-stakes project).  
  
Here I am right now typing this post trying to rationale to myself what my next step is. My confidence level is at an all-time low and I'm not sure my reasoning to change job is sound/logical. There's lots of good things about my current company (colleagues, benefits, pay) but the work I'm responsible for is absolutely giving me anxiety. There's also the fear that it isn't always greener on the other side which is holding me back from making the job change."
191v00n,Anxiety,2024-01-08,I NEED HOPE AND HELP!!!,"I have spent months obsessively reading posts about different kinds of meds, side effects and others experiences with them. This has left me absolutely terrified to start a med. I have never taken a med before but it's clear I need help (I have a therapist and med dr) but I feel like this whole med thing is such a huge risk. 

I am experiencing GAD, OCD, PTSD, Depression, Irritation and Agigtation, Intrusive Thoughts, Rumination, Fear and Terror Feelings, Insomnia and a Inner restlessness. 

After typically only getting 1 to 6 hours of sleep in which my body feels restless the entire time (like full body RLS) I wake up daily with instant dread, vibrating and heaviness in my chest, constant feeling of anxiety and restlessness, total lack of appitite, my entire body/jaw tensed up tight and my muscles twitch. I don't know how to get out of this state. I DO NOT get crazy racing heart or panic attacks, instead I have a constant feeling of pure anxiety and dread, heaviness, depression/crying spells, constantly looping/intrusive thoughts, things irritating me so easily. I cry because I just feel such despair. I cannot connect or find joy in things anymore. This came on with a flip of a switch in Septemeber. I have a husband and a 5 year old son who I feel like I am failing. I can't live like this. 

Although I want to sit on my couch and do nothing because I feel so horrible with these physical and mental sensations... I'm still getting out of the house and doing things. I don't have panic attacks driving or going places (so its not like agoraphobia) Im taking my son places... it's just VERY uncomfortable the entire time because of this heavy constant anxiety and my body feeling like it wants to run from itself. I do things to distract myself but that's all I ever do now. Cleaning isn't to clean, it's to try and NOT FEEL LIKE THIS. It does feel like my nervous system is on a hairpin trigger. My thoughts and simple things on TV make me feel like my body reacts. 

At my worst, I have periods that feel like episodes where I wasn't sleeping a single minute at night, I was pacing my house like I was on meth, I couldn't sit still, all of my emotions turned off, I was constantly on my phone looking for solutions (I still do that) and feeling like I want to jump off a roof. These somehow settle down and I am left in this state. Bi Polar has been ruled out by professionals. 

When I look on these reddits, I feel like I relate more to the horrible side effects that people experience when starting the meds (in regards to my physical and mental state) and not the initial reason people start the meds. I feel like my nervous system is fried and that I am in is such a bad place and I am scared to make this any worse.

Like, yeah, a forty second voice conversation in exchange for very affordable transportation definitely isn't unreasonable, but I hate it anyway.

I can't afford to live in a city where everything's nearby because I really, really struggle to work full-time. I get panic attacks and shutdowns.

i clean everything before someone comes over, making sure it looks perfect because i don’t want anyone to see me being messy but then i can’t relax once the person is over, if they make any kind of mess, even dropping a single crumb on the floor, i HAVE to clean it up right away 

it feels like i’m watching their every move and cant enjoy their company because all i’m doing is thinking about the mess they’re making. my friend came over the other day to watch a movie and we had popcorn while on the couch and i couldn’t stop looking over to make sure she wasn’t getting crumbs anywhere, and i had to physically stop myself from picking up the tiniest of kernels that landed on the couch 

i hate that i make such an unwelcoming environment, who wants to go over someone’s house only to be watched like a hawk? 

i know i can just clean when they leave, it’s not a big deal, but if i don’t clean it in the moment or tell them to be careful then i start resenting them and getting annoyed then have to spend the rest of the time trying not to show that i want to kick them out of my house so i can clean their mess 

it’s gotten to the point where my close friends know not to do certain things automatically, and it makes me happy and sad at the same time bc i’m glad they’re being thoughtful but i’m embarrassed that they have to be so thoughtful in the first place.

When I was still in school at aged 13 or 14, there were two brothers who were the big bullies in the school. They were the most awful teens at the school and didnt like anyone that was different from them.  
Once during swim class at the public pool, on of the brothers saw me getting changed out of my underwear to put my swim shorst on, and proceeded to tell all the other boys that I had a wonky penis because it curves slightly to the left.   
And another time while I was using the bathroom at the urinals in school, one of the brothers came in and saw me and told everyone he could that I had a pointy penis because I am uncircumszied.  Both brothers were circumsized and told everyone about it all the time. They were know as the Cut Twins in our school.   
  
Untill the day I left school at 16 I was called Pointy Penis or Wonky Wang. Along with Hoodie Dick, Curvy Cock and Foreskin Freak.  
  
Its led me to have serious confidence issues about my penis, and has caused me to have a serious anxiety about my foreskin. I dont like pulling it back infront of anyone, and I havnt scince I was 16. Not even doctors or my ex fiancee. I just get an overwhelming fear of rejection, what if they laugh at me, what if they dont like me after, what if they tease me about it, what if something touches me and it hurts, what if my penis gets dirty while my foreskin is pulled back. I get so anxious and worked up that I cannot pull my foreskin back infront of anyone. Only by myself, and even then it takes alot of effort when washing my penis for example, and I dont like pulling it back for long.

I have been teaching for many years and been teaching this one class in particularly for 4 months. They are my tutor group and they are silent and perfectly behaved. Never been an issue. Strangely enough during my first lesson back with them in the new term last week I had a sudden surge of emotion,my heart was beating fast and I felt like I was about to cry but just about managed to avoid it before putting on a video to distract myself and the class. I taught fine for the rest of the day with other more difficult classes. If then happened again in Friday morning and after a restful weekend it happened again this morning. 

I am now very concerned already about tomorrow. They are nice but they are teenagers and there a few students in there that would never let me live it down and spread the news around school if I suddenly cried. I'm looking for advice on how to avoid this situation tomorrow. 

I even took chamomile tea today and drank lots before that first lesson but it did nothing.

I’ve stopped watching tv because I’ve associated them with negative things, I’ve cut out social media because it was triggering compulsions, I won’t try anything new because I’m afraid of potential negative fallout (which is ridiculous because there is little to no potential fallout of anything I’ve considered hobby wise). I’ve even considered breaking up with my boyfriend because he shares a slight resemblance with a family member I dislike and it’s making a negative association in my mind.

I have been considering anxiety medication for a minute now. I usually wouldn't consider drugs to make myself feel better, though I'm concerned about my mental health. I have just started a new semester in school and am worried about my health.

I don't usually get panic attacks that often but I have multiple test heavy classes this semester. Some of the symptoms I face when stressed.

-Struggling to breath
-Insomnia/poor sleep quality
-stomach aches/issues (can last several hours)
-Constant rumination.
-Panic attacks
-Feeling ill (in the most dramatic way possible, what I imagine cancer feels like).

I feel like it's obvious I should seek some form of medical professionalism or help. But anyone who has taken anxiety meds or done therapy, will I see any changes in my life? I have never struggled in school and know that I will probably be ok this semester. But is there anything I can do to alleviate this feeling of impending doom?

""What to say next, What are they going to say, What tone should I reply in, Should I smile or laugh."" I get socially drained the more conversations I have a day. I suck at having conversations because I am constantly in my head.

I don't know if this is more of an ADHD problem or an anxiety problem, but I am exhausted of how much I overthink everything. It has gotten to the point where most days are hard to ""learn/deal with it"".  
  
I am wanting to get on medication and was curious what has worked the best for everyone? Obviously I will talk with a doctor after this. I have read that Sertraline/Zoloft is good and Adderall/Vyvanse. One of my coworkers even told me he got on Testosterone and it increasingly helped his social anxiety.

I am writing this entry to see if anyone else has some insight to offer regarding my situation. 

I suffered a nasty flu just over two weeks ago and have honestly not felt the slightest bit myself since. Although my physical symptoms have mostly resolved (aside from a lingering cough), I have experienced a tremendous amount of anxiety during and following this infection. Prior to this event, I was able to manage my anxiety very successfully for years without medication or therapy. I did, however, experience “episodes” beforehand where my anxiety was more severe for periods of time. I was able to overcome them gradually with time and lifestyle adjustments. 

This time, however, my anxiety has become simply unbearable. I am experiencing what I would call near constant “adrenaline surges” in which I am unable to calm down effectively. I am trembling, shaking, and internally vibrating quite often. It has greatly affected my daily activities and ability to rest. My OCD tendencies have also returned to an exceptional degree that I am simply crushed by. I have not felt this restless in years. It feels as though someone has “flipped a switch” in my brain, so to speak. 

For what it’s worth, I do have a history of severe chronic infections stemming from childhood. I eventually got my tonsils removed at age 8 and had ear tubes installed to help alleviate said infections as well.

I have also suffered from anxiety since I was practically a toddler (hereditary), but not to this extent.

Any advice or feedback you may have would be greatly appreciated! Thank you for taking the time to read my entry. Great health and happiness to you all!

P.S. I am currently in the process of consulting my GP about my situation. I do hope to find some answers soon so that I may return to a state of well-being once again."

Like i think about all the work and hard times i had to go through (when i was deep in the anxiety hole years ago) and i don't know if i have it in me. Why do i feel overwhelmed and uninterested at the idea of getting my life back when it was the happiest i've ever been?

  
Sometimes i don't understand my brain lmfao. Anyone else has felt the same? Thank you for taking the time to read this!!!"

191k0w3,Anxiety,2024-01-08,Fear of not be able to fall asleep,"Afraid of not falling asleep

Hi,

i am new here and i wanted to ask how can i cope with the thoughts in my head. When something i am looking forward to or something important takes place on the next day i cant't stop thinking about if i can sleep tonight or not. The problem is that something in my mind says you have to sleep know or else something physically will happen to you tomorrow like a heart attack or epilepsy. I had to struggle with anxiety for a long time also anxiety of dying so thats not new to me. I take sleep to seriously and cant fall asleep because i stress myself about sleeping. When i have nothing to do on the next day i can sleep perfectly but if something i classify as important which can also just be a birthday of a colleague in the evening i just cant fall asleep.

Looking forward to your advice. Thanks !"
191jsgb,Anxiety,2024-01-08,Any tips to get rid of that daily gut wrenching feeling in the pit of my stomach? I’m desperate for some relief :(,"I’m not talking about cramps, gas, indigestion or diarrhea. I’m referring to the upset stomach I get from nervous anxiety and raw emotional pain in the pit of my stomach in the solar plexus area. Deep breathing is only a temporary fix. SSRIs don’t work for me. The only thing that does is Ativan but my doctor won’t prescribe me these regularly.

EDIT: I most often get this when I wake up at 5am or later at 7am when I’m actually supposed to get up. Likely me dreading work when it’s a morning thing or just something bothering me in general even at an unconscious level. But sometimes it’s all day long or comes and goes."

191iwps,Anxiety,2024-01-08,my dad cheated,"my dad cheated and thinks he can tell my mom that he wants to divorce her

so this is a really weird story ik but let me tell it from the beginning. 
my dad and mom have been married seventeen years now and have me my little sister and little brother. my dad around two years ago started being just super weird and distant and rude and angry and mean to the whole family and it was around the time when i stared going through a really tough time mentally. 

i’m sixteen and it started the beginning of my sophomore year and it was just awful, it got bad enough to a point where i was cutting myself and couldn’t even get out of bed to go to school. my dad would beat me for this and my mom would sometimes beat me too, my dad was always worse though he’d pick me up by my hair and throw me off my bed and stuff it was just the worst year of my life. 

so about three months ago this lady texted my mom and told her that my dad was married to her and that she had a kid and was expecting another kid and my mom went absolutely ballistic on my dad, my dad denied it at first and wouldn’t give my mom the phone for hours as they screamed and broke everything upstairs, me and my siblings were all in my sisters bed just listening to it. it got bad enough the next day with their fighting that they both hit each other and my mom called the police on my dad, the police just talked to both of them and sort of told my mom to get a restraining order and that they couldn’t do anything and my dad just left the house to go to work at the restaurants, 
oh yeah this is important so my parents own two businesses, restaurants, that they work at. technically my dads an engineer er but he says “he doesn’t want to work for anybody”. 
so the police left and we were just sort of taking it all in we had two half siblings and my dad had been cheating with a whole other wife for two years. the thing is my mom can’t divorce him for another three years minimum because their visa or greencard is connected and if they get divorced then the green card will expire and we’ll all be sent back to saudi and my mom and we don’t want that because we’ve lived here our whole lives. 

my dad said nasty things to my mom and still says them but my mom has like made a plan to trick him into thinking she forgave him and that she wants to work out the marriage because he put everything under his name 
the house both the businesses which btw were my moms she worked in them day and night and put all the effort into them. he bought the other wife a range rover and took her to florida 
and i forgot to add this too but this lady was an employee at the resteraunt my parents hired because she was homeless and lived in a shelter and apparently had three abusive husbands so my mom hired her to help her have a fresh start. this lady is also like insane she abused her last husbands and she would scream at my dad and ig h she held a knife up to his throat once too but he still didn’t ever leave her. 
he did leave her when my mom found out bc apparently he made a fucking deal with her that if she ever told my mom he would divorce her. 

and also he gave me the other wives broken up kia soul when he bought her the range and i was super happy because like i thought he really got me a car and stuff, but it was really just the other wives old car. when he divorced her he took the car back from her and gave it to me but when he got home with the car and saw my mom crying he screamed at my mom and said this is my wife and i had to spoil her 

oh and he also bought the other wife an apartment and gave her over six hundred thousand dollars while me and my mom and siblings have been saving money for two years and not spending it on anything other then necessities bc my mom told us my dad was going through a struggling time and we didn’t have that much money but he was really just giving it to the other fucking wife 

for the past three months he’s been mentally abusing my mom and calling her crazy and telling her to stop talking about it he gives her these strikes before he says he’s going to divorce her 

and just the other day he was screaming at my mom for crying and saying if she doesn’t leave the room which is literally her room he would divorce her right then. he tells my mom that she was useless and he could never talk to her and she was only sometimes good for him to have sec with and he just says these horrible terrible disgusting things to her. 

let me tell u about my mom now. my mom pretty much raised us our whole lives oh yeah my dad also said she did a terrible job with us even though he was never home but anyways my mom put us in every sport and activity and drove us there and back and still came home and she worked at the restaurant and came home to make dinner for us every night she’s the most loving sweet caring and kind person you could ever think of. 

i feel like i’ve been sort of carrying the whole house for the last couple of weeks and i already had anxiety before but it’s just so bad now it’s gotten to the point where i can’t eep any food down but i really want to be there for my mom and just my siblings and everyone and idk what to do it’s so hard living and pretending to love and like my dad because we can’t show him that we don’t or he’ll really divorce my mom and break the family and all of our lives pretty much. 

at the beginning he would tell my mom to go back to saudi to her parents because he was such a bad person and trying to guilt trip her and stuff but me and my mom think he just wanted her out of the house so he could bring his other wife to our house and for her to live here. 
oh i also forgot to metntion like a week after my mom found out he said he was going to kill himself and we had to call the police and we were like speeding driving around the city to find him and we literally thought he died but he was just faking it 

it just breaks my heart seeing my mom have to live through this and i really don’t know what to do . he took five thousand dollars of my parents house cash stash and we think he bought her some used car and he’s been going to her house in the middle of working me and my mom know because he’s he put a tracker in his car he also used 100k of my moms money to buy the other wife the range rover i honestly just can’t believe that his disgusting lady literally came from a shelter and my dad did this so yeah"

Has anyone ever experienced moderate night sweats that wake you up at like 3am?

I keep trying to hype myself and think oh this must be sepsis but in reality after fighting an infection I’m feeling better with antibiotics that have almost run its course.

This doesn’t appear to be a side effect of any medication I’m on, however this has happened about 4 times this week, I assume this must be a symptom of my anxiety."

It would not be a problem, but I just hate this feeling always wet and smelly….."
191ifrq,Anxiety,2024-01-08,Sleepy/Sad/Anxious all the time due to personal changes in my life?,"For the past week or so, I’m extremely fatigued and sad, I go to bed every night at a time earlier than I am used to and as a result, wake up very early as well (though sometimes I can’t sleep because of my thoughts). Still that sleepiness doesn’t go away. 

I’ve also been very emotional, crying days in a row/having that burning feeling in my eyes, trying to keep myself together. While I’ve always been a very sensitive/sentimental person, it wasn’t often that I cried.

I want to watch or read something to take my mind off of things, I can’t (focusing is really hard).

I barely eat anything when I used to have quite a good appetite.

I can’t even be bothered to go outside or meet up with friends when I used to every week.

I used to be someone who made their bed every day and I can’t even do that anymore, just feels like it isn’t worth the effort.

I should mention that while I always was an anxious person who overthinked every minuscule thing, I still tried to be positive, had some energy, ate a lot, participated in things I enjoyed and (tried) to look on the bright side.

I think the cause of these recent events is attributed to one main factor; I’m starting my very first job in a completely new country in a short time.

I’ve been stewing in my own thoughts all day, thinking about worst case scenarios, how I’m going to do certain things in a country where I don’t know how to (I’ve never been the type of person to go with the flow, I always like to be prepared, have back up plans and be in control), the disruption in my routine, the intense budgeting I’m going to have to do, if I made the right choice or not, the homesickness I already feel, the feeling like it’s the point of no return and how much I’m going to miss my family, friends, pets, home and country (I currently live with my family and close with them, while I was alone in another city for Uni it wasn’t that far away and I still had friends and that familiarity I was used to).

I hope I came to the right place as it is my first time posting on somewhere like this and I don’t know where else to go, I’m feeling very helpless lately and like I’m overreacting (many people my age do these things but they don’t get stressed out as easily as I do). Nothing anyone in my life is saying is helping or cheering me up so I decided to vent my feelings on here."

191hv4k,Anxiety,2024-01-08,Bad anxiety following car crash,"Hey all, new here. TW: post involves discussion of a head-on traffic collision. Be advised.

Anyway, a few weeks ago I was involved in a collision which was deemed not my fault by both CHP and insurance. Long story short, it was 10:15pm in the Sierras of NorCal, I was headed out to see a buddy as it was the last day of school preceding Christmas Break (I'm a school employee). I was about a mile from home on a 2 lane undivided road, headed toward the freeway. The roads here are moderately windy, unlit, and see snow for 3-6 months of the year. It was dark, foggy (1000ft), and the roads were damp from the day's rain. I was behind another car going 30mph in a 40 due to visibility. Coming up to a blind curve, I notice the glare of oncoming headlights. Suddenly, the car in front swerves, narrowly avoiding a head-on with the oncoming car in my lane, leaving me with 1 second to react. I took the collision head-on and airbags deployed. I suffered a broken right wrist because of it. The driver turned out to be extremely drunk and unable to perform Field Sobriety Tests beyond the HGN. She was uninjured and subsequently booked into county jail for felony DUI causing injury following a blood tox.

My issue I face now is because this road is so close in proximity to my home and it's the route I must take to go anywhere, I am reminded each time I leave the house of that night. I can no longer drive without being constantly on edge until I get to the freeway or back home. I am a school bus driver and routinely drive these types of roads, on average 110mi per day. I also commute 20mi to work each way. I cannot live like this, but I have yet to find a way to get over the constant anxiety I feel when driving. I went from someone who loved to go out and do things to someone who fears leaving the comfort of my home. I feel anxious each time I step into the garage and see my other un-wrecked car, because just the thought of driving makes me get a small adrenaline rush. I lay awake some nights with the events replaying in my head without control, causing me to lose sleep. Although I've tried to get back out on the road and reduce my anxiety by reminding myself that those events are highly unlikely, it seems there's a little voice telling me that it's bound to happen again. 

I more or less needed a space to write out how I'm feeling, but I also ask if anyone has tips to make this easier to deal with. I plan on seeking help as this anxiety is detrimental to the safe performance of my job, and greatly reducing my quality of life. If you read this far, thank you. I hope in the end that things turn out better, and I plan to pursue a career in which I can remove these selfish people from the road before hurting someone else like I was, or worse."

Yesterday I was sitting in my room and my shelves caught my attention. I swear they were getting bigger. I watched the shadow which also felt like it was getting bigger/closer to me. Obviously I know it didn't happen but it kinda fucked with me, I swear that's what I saw. 
I watched the shelves for like 10 minutes and they kept doing it. Getting bigger, then they suddenly got normal again just to get bigger again. 
I lay down and went to sleep. Couldn't fall asleep, I have tapestry on my bed (it's a bunk bed so the tapestry is on the wall and above me on the bottom of the top bunk). It was dark and I felt like the tapestry kept getting closer.

Today I keep seeing something out the corner of my eye. I have a huge headache, feel tired and confused. 
Can that be caused by anxiety? I had depression, anxiety and ocd diagnosed when I was 12 (I'm 21 rn) and have been on different pills since then. 
This has never happened to me, not even when I was doing so much worse than I'm now. Not that I'm doing super good now, but it was worse.

I [22F] have been diagnosed with a UTI around four months ago, got prescribed antibiotics. I took the full course and went back, apparently I still had it. Took another different antibiotic full course. Over time, my stomach pain has gotten more severe. I can barely eat anything anymore without flair ups. It seems like I randomly and suddenly became intolerant towards gluten and lactose, which I never had a problem with before. Really horrible acid reflux. Fast forward to now, I had to go to the hospital for these stomach pangs and food intolerance just for them to conclude that *nothing* was wrong with me except for the fact that I had a UTI. The same UTI??
During this time, I'm developing cysts all over my body and I'm freaking out at this point. I'm always in pain, I'm exhausted. I'm losing sleep. I've been ill for around five months now and I'm deeply terrified of going into septic shock. I just came out of the hospital around a week ago with nothing prescribed and I feel like I'm going insane. I don't know what to do anymore.

191g8oi,Anxiety,2024-01-08,How to help a teenage girl learn how to destress,"I 29m live with my boyfriend and his family, and his brother's girlfriend also lives here. She is 16f, and in the early stages of pregnancy. She gets stressed out so easily, and shuts down. I know with pregnancy there are hormones changing her emotions, but still, she is incredibly sensitive. 

I know her home life was probably a big factor in her anxiety, and she used to get bullied in school. She was homeschooled during middle school, it was because of the bullying, but her mom is also a narcissist helicopter parent. She doesn't believe her daughter can do anything, and if she learned to do anything it was because she didn't love her mom, and her mom always made it all about her. her dad on the other hand was a know it all kind of narcissist. He would never admit to being wrong, would let everyone know he was smarter than everyone, and had a very questionable way of parenting. He is the one who kicked her out when she got pregnant to ""learn how to be an adult"".

so this girl is full of anxiety. She can't handle any criticisms, or anything going wrong slightly, and she always takes blame, and then shuts down. I was trying to help her with her homework, and I very calmly said, ""oh look here, do you see your mistake"", and she apologized and called herself all different words for stupid, and I told her it was only a mistake, and she wouldn't talk after that. After trying to get her to feel okay for 20 minutes, she said she just wanted to go to her room. Also when we went out to get fast food, they were out of something, so my boyfriend didn't get everything he wanted. So she blames it on herself, and apologizes to him. she then tries to give him all of her food and said she didn't need anything. We practically had to force her to eat her own food, and the she apologizes again for making everything worse. then she hid in her room for hours.

I just feel like she has never been taught a healthy way to deal with stress. Her only coping mechanism is to shut down and hide, and i think she could be much happier if she learned the skill, but I'm not sure what that skill is or how to teach it."

As a woman I am very afraid of what others might do to me. I am afraid that if I offend somebody they will hurt me so bad. I don’t own a car so I took a bus and walk home to my house, I kid you not every second I always have to keep looking back because you know anyone can do shit to me while I am not looking either.
-throw acid (which is my biggest nightmare)
-SA 
-beat me up and etc
-worst killing me 

Even though I know to my self that none of this scenarios in my head would be unlikely and unrealistic to happen. I mean it stresses me out caused idk what is my mind doing to me.

At the end of the day I NEVER wish for this scenarios to happened at all. Hell I even overthink of something that never happened at all."
191djwv,Anxiety,2024-01-08,Medication for Mental Symptoms,"Whenever I hear people talk about going on meds for their anxiety, they mostly talk about how it alleviates the physical symptoms like sweating, shaking, shortness of breath. 

But for me, most of my anxiety is in my head. I don't have that many physical symptoms; my anxiety is centered around negative thoughts of myself and what other people might be thinking about me, mostly taking the form of social anxiety. Are there medications that work for those kinds of symptoms? 

I know there's cbt but I tried that before and it didn't really do much for me, so I'm hoping that there's still something out there that'll make life a little better for me."
191dilz,Anxiety,2024-01-08,My least favorite side effect ever,"I’ve taken several different medications in my life for anxiety and depression. SSRI’s cause urinary retention, so I can’t take those. A while ago, my doctor put me on hydroxyzine to take as needed. Last night, I took it for the first time in months. When I woke up this morning, I felt fine but a little groggy, so I decided to sleep a little longer. I woke up an hour later, and my vision was so blurry. After a few minutes of my vision not returning to normal, I started to panic. I used to work for an ophthalmologist, so I started thinking about all the serious eye issues I could potentially have. I noticed my vision was very slowly starting to return to normal, and I was finally able to see to google some things. It only took a few minutes to learn that the antihistamine in hydroxyzine can make your vision blurry when you wake up because it can dry out your eyes. After a couple hours, my vision was finally back to normal. I seem to get the weirdest side effects for any medication I take for my mental health. 😬"

Recently I was laid off from my job and have been on the job market.  I've had an interview here and there but haven't been able to land a job and that's been stressful enough as it is.  To add to that, my grandfather is trying to force me into a security position at our local stadium.  While he's correct that ""its a job"", it doesn't mesh well with my anxiety which is primarily triggered by large crowds and/or physical confrontations.  I understand my Pops' point of view, I'm 30, pretty large dude, naturally mean looking face, I look the part, but even thinking about it makes my stomach drop.  I've tried explaining my issues but it's like talking to a wall, my Pops' doesn't understand nor is he willing to try to understand, he acts like he's willing to listen but just starts yelling the second I say something he doesn't like.

I recently even bought an old Kodak from 2008 and it takes photos as good (and more real looking) than my iPhone. It doesn't even matter what phone you have, it's all processed now.

I also want to buy an old iPod Classic in space grey because they're beautiful and simple, but I would miss my bluetooth headphones.

 It makes me sad looking back, because it will never feel the same like it did back then. 

Frutiger Aero. Blackberry, Cricket, LG, etc. Different political setup. Live performances weren't overcrowded or clogged with phones. Social media barely existed. 

I mean, I'm happy to have my own choice in the matter and not partake in a lot of these things, but I really wish how it was then and I know I would be happier with a simpler life.

When you realize a lot of things that are simple now will be gone in the future, then it affects you even more imo.

191cm1e,Anxiety,2024-01-08,Anxiety feeling crippling,"Crippling work and social anxiety #help

33F, and long story short I had a shittt child hood. I don’t like to talk about it because I was told everyone has a story. I grew up in foster care, adopted by a family friend who treated me like crap and was abusive. Ended back in foster care as a kid, bounced around for years and then was out of my own from very young. Have countless post traumatic stress situations I can recall that have caused me such panic and trauma. More to the story but you get the jisp.

My entire life has been fight or flight, I have battled anxiety and depression. More so anxiety in my adult hood. My anxiety has gone through stages but over the past 5-7 years my anxiety has been taken a bad turn every single year getting worse. 

I went from having panic attacks every now and then to having them daily. 

I managed to go to college, get a degree, work my way up in corporate. Make a great living for Myself, have a husband and a dog and a beautiful home and life together.

But my anxiety has gotten to a point for me that it feels crippling. I have constant worry about the future as in minor things, worried about a meeting I have at work, what will people think when I say something, did I say something wrong, I go over a conversation or an email over and over again for weeks upon weeks it’s sickening. Constantly worrying about how I came Off, if I sounded stupid.

I have a hard time paying attention, often frantic about these things all day that I started to make mistakes in work over the last few years and some of these mistakes still haunt me. I’m constantly second guessing every little tiny thing I do for work. This goes on socially as well, with people that are acquaintances, or my in law family.

 I cut back on drinking to barely nothing I mean like once or twice a year because the anxiety is so bad afterword I found it not to be worth it to drink. 

My work anxiety though is by far the worst. I 100% battle with imposter syndrome. And part of it is I can remember things people have said that have made me feel stupid over the years. That of course traces back to my insecurities from childhood of always feeling like I wasn’t smart, kids made fun of me in school because I never knew the answer when I got called on. But in school I was worrying about having a place to live and not school. 

Then in work I can recall times of people making me feel stupid for not knowing something. Something that doesn’t even pertain to work. One guy asked me years ago, do I  know what IQ stood for? I said no I don’t actually. Then he put me down for not knowing this and laughed at me. This was at work. I asked my friend who I think is one of the smart people in my life if she knew what it stood for and she didn’t. But things like this live on with me forever. Like I said probably traced back to my childhood. I go over situations like this in my head countless times. My confidence is in the drain, it causes me panics throughout my day, and some days I feel crippled in bed or hard to start my day because I’m constantly worried that I’m not cut out for work.

I have been in therapy for years. I just moved and have the opportunity to try a different type of therapy for anxiety called EMDR and hoping that helps. 

Idk I’m looking for advice, anything. Anyone else experience this? Anyone else actually overcome anxiety? I have googled so many things to help, read other stories, read books, tried therapy and countless medications. I feel stuck and sometimes feel like this can’t be it. There has to be something that can really help. Atleast I hope so. #hell"

Hi, I’m 21f and have struggled with severe GAD my whole life and symptoms of depression and OCD. My anxiety is preventing me from doing everyday things and functioning like a normal human being. I dont know what other options there are for me. I’ve tried many SSRIs (currently on 60mg Prozac) and am on 0.5mg Ativan as needed. I don’t think the Ativan helps much but I’m too scared to take a higher dose because I don’t want to feel high (I’ve had extreme panic attacks from marijuana use and hate the feeling of being high) and I’ve already been taking it for months so I don’t want to be addicted. 
I’m at my wits end with anxiety, I never feel relaxed or relief and this is leading to horrible physical symptoms and depression from my body being in a constant state of anxiety. Has anyone taken antipsychotics for anxiety and have they helped? Or is there any other last resort treatment that has worked for anyone?
Any help is appreciated"
191b9hi,Anxiety,2024-01-08,How to deal with my anxiety?,"Ok. So here goes. Please be kind. I never thought I'd end up writing on Reddit, but I'm desperate. About three years ago, I lost my dad after a short but horrible illness (leukemia + dementia). Thankfully it was fast, but he did suffer. I'm an only child and have no real family support, so I had to be my mom's rock. After he passed, I was numb for about a year, until my dog got sick and had to be hospitalized. He made it, but that week was the worst...crippling anxiety, constantly thinking about my dad, crying in the shower because I just could cope, etc. I can't even put it into words. 
So of course, I started therapy. At first it worked, and I guess it still does, a bit. I went back to school to become a psychologist, I was happier and felt like my life was back on track. But December came rolling in and it all went to hell. Once again, crippling anxiety, terror that something is going to happen to my dog (he's 16 and suffering from arthritis) and just in general a feeling of doom. And now my mom caught some bug and I'm about to lose it. The doctor says she's fine, but I'm staying at her house just in case we have to rush to the hospital like we did with my dad, because my f***ing anxiety says something is going to happen. I can't cope. I think I'm in so much pain that crying isn't really an option for me, it just won't come (until today, which was a first). I'm on clonazepam, but I'm at the point where it's just not helping. Also, I also see my therapist every month now, because I was better. But I'm really not anymore. And I hate this.

1919ymd,Anxiety,2024-01-08,Healt anxiety,"Here is my story. In 2015.  I had a misabortion. I fell mentally but I didn't give up, I continued. After that I didn't get pregnant, I went for 6 years of examinations for various tests, and everything was fine, but there was no baby. In 2018.  finally IVF, but unfortunately unsuccessful. Disappointed really. In 2019.  on the second IBF, without any hope, with no faith that it will be... in 3 weeks I have a positive test. Overjoyed and very scared. The whole pregnancy in fear, in panic, every week for an examination because of some panic attack (for which then  I didn't think they were panic attacks).Luckily, she was born with a c-section healthy and alive. Finally happy. Unfortunately, not for long. I got deep vein thrombosis with embolism, I couldn't walk, I was coughing, my leg was swollen... I ended up in the hospital,  luckily I'm coming out alive again. This whole period I'm too strong, yes I cry, but deep down somewhere I believe that everything will be ok. After 3-4 months I start: I have a stomach disease - I'm going to do a blood test and an echo, I have breast cancer  -I go for an echo....so for 1 year until my husband sat me down and told me that this is not right, I only google about diseases. And yes, then I got married. But that didn't change anything, I continued to go every second  a week of examinations for various self-diagnoses with an excuse: here it is now for sure. And it's been like this for 4 years. I tried EFT, it didn't help, I tried talking to a psychologist, it didn't help either...

191972c,Anxiety,2024-01-08,Anxious teen (16M) increasingly doesn’t leave the house - how to help?,"Hi everyone. I’m hoping people whose anxiety has gotten to the point of not going out, or who are/were very anxious as teens, can offer some insight into their thought processes and what works or worked for them. Basically I’m a parent of a teen in that situation and I’m struggling with how best to help him.

Both my wife and I have ongoing anxiety issues but our son seems to have got everything we do and more. Over the last few years, post-COVID return to in-class schooling has been hard and assignment/exam anxiety has often been debilitating, causing many missed school days. Many mornings were a battle to get him out of bed. His marks however remain good - not straight As but certainly good enough.

However he has not gone to school at all for the last few months, stemming from some assessments that he struggled with after missing a couple of weeks of school. 

He has been seeing a psychologist and that has been helpful, but over the last few weeks seems to be withdrawing more, avoiding other family members, getting angry more often, and not wanting to go out at all. While he wasn’t going to school he was at least coming out for family dinners etc but that has stopped and I don’t think he has left the house in about three weeks. Last night we were going to go out to dinner, but I said the wrong thing and so he immediately refused to go. To me that seemed like any excuse to refuse would have been good enough.

He does still seem to be in contact with friends but has not seen them. They are all similar personalities so organising to go out doesn’t come naturally to them. But I do hear him talking to them via online gaming.

I’ve been trying to talk to him but get the sense that I am starting to be annoying. Ultimately I’m a middle aged parent and I can understand a 16 year old not wanting to open up to me. It’s also hard to know what is anxiety and what is just being a moody teenager. But I am increasingly at a loss as to how to help him, and worry that when school goes back for the year in a few weeks he won’t be able to bring himself to go.

So - if this is/was you, was there anything that helped you? Were there things that made it worse? Was there something you wished someone would have done for you? And if you recovered from this sort of scenario, how, and how is your life now?

Really appreciate any input and thanks so much if you read this far."

1918pn2,Anxiety,2024-01-08,Anxiety as a kid,"I’ve seen tiktok’s of people saying how they had anxiety as a kid but didn’t know it at the time. I was wondering if anyone else can relate/share there stories.

So for me, from at least 2nd grade to 7th grade, I would get up extra early and once I was dressed and ready, I would sit on the toilet for 45 minutes before the bus came to make sure I didn’t have to pee while on the bus. I didn’t understand at the time why I always had to pee at terrible times, but I realize now that I was just so nervous/anxious for school that it made me have to go to the bathroom a lot. This happened when I was at social events, in line for rides at an amusement park I was scared of, at the grocery store, in classes I didn’t know anyone in, etc. My mom would get so furious that I would have to use the bathroom everywhere I go and at the worst times. 
I’m 23 now and have improved since then and treated my anxiety. But it just breaks my heart looking back at 8 year old me and how much anxiety I had so frequently that I didn’t understand at all."

1918hrd,Anxiety,2024-01-08,Anxiety &amp; Sleep advice,"Hi all,  
I have known that I have a fair amount of anxiety for a long time, and possibly depression. However, I get on fine with work and achieving things, I'm happily married, and socialise regularly with friends. What I'm trying to say is, I often rationalise that my anxiety hasn't stopped me from having a full life and therefore doesn't matter. I'm beginning to wonder if I haven't just got used to negating it.  
I recently started another round of therapy. I previously had 12 weeks of therapy due to a very complicated and intense family dynamic and to support me through a difficult time of change. This therapy is being provided by my employer, and when I did the initial assessment quiz they told me I have moderate to severe depression and severe anxiety. I was quite surprised, and spent a long time thinking over my answers wondering if I'd been overly dramatic about anything (which maybe should have told me what I needed to know...).  
I'm trying to be more aware of my mental health and more connected. I know that I go through some spells where I cry a lot, but these are fairly uncommon now I'm older and always pass or is linked to something happening. I do however obsess painfully over very small things constantly. For example, I met an old friend today in the supermarket and in my surprise to see her I gave her a hug. We used to work together, with her as my supervisor and I spent the entire afternoon in deep worry that it was innappropriate to hug her. I find big parties or busy social situations very worrying, and often make up excuses to avoid them. I do love meeting friends for coffee though! I worry about eating meals with them, or being in large groups where I might be sat somewhere awkward, or going for walks in case they think I'm too slow or lazy. I find it easiest in small visits where I feel in control I suppose, and then scurry home.   
I'm beginning to realise that my biggest issues are overeating and sleep. I struggle a lot to sleep and often get up in the night when my stomach is so fluttery and feet are so twitchy it feels like torture to stay in bed. I always thought I was just a bit of a night owl but am beginning to see how things add up.  
Anyone with anxiety experienced very intense butterflies and twitchiness when trying to sleep? Like it's painful to try and lie still? Sometimes you know it's coming, which maybe brings it on more. Any advice?  
Any general advice for this point in my journey? I feel okay, but am beginning to spot ways that I'm maybe not. For context, I had some challenges growing up (racial trauma, poverty, abandoned by Father, single parent Mother who was full of love but struggled with hoarding, undiagnosed ADHD with meltdowns, and intense trauma of her own). I've spoken about all this a lot on therapy. New therapist has suggested speaking to GP about medication but I'm very keen to avoid that if I can. "

1918cyg,Anxiety,2024-01-08,prescription alternatives to benzos,"I have generalized anxiety disorder and panic disorder that tends to come in waves every few years. I'm having a tough year with anxiety right now. For the past 9 months, I've been taking 100 mg of Zoloft, and now I'm also taking 150 mg of Wellbutrin. Before Zoloft, I tried Buspar, but had side effects that weren't subsiding. 

I wish I could say that the Wellloft mixture was a miracle, but I only feel slightly better. I have so much anxiety about having anxiety, and panic about getting panicky. It's awful. My doctor has given me 10mg of Xanax about every 6-8 weeks for several months now, but she is now reluctant to continue that because I ""should"" be feeling much better with the Zoloft and Wellbutrin. The Xanax is the only thing that truly helps, and even just having the prescription makes me feel better. 

I have propranolol to take as needed, which helps, but it doesn't calm down my brain (and it's not supposed to). Does anyone have suggestions for other medications I could ask for for panic symptoms? I've heard of people taking gabapentin for panic. Does that work or do people have some other suggestions, even off-label ones? Thank you!

19188d1,Anxiety,2024-01-08,UK PIP Appeal Help,"TLDR; Applied for PIP. Got 0 points. Did mandatory reconsideration with a well-worded and thought out letter attached explaining how my issues affect me. Got 0 points again. Going to appeal.   
I have depression, generalised anxiety disorder and ADHD, all of which i need to be medicated for because of how much they affect my daily life, and even WITH the medication, I am still affected by them every day regardless because medication isn't magic, as we know. I don't understand how with 31 pages of evidence that i sent them of diagnoses, prescriptions, proof that i've been on sleeping pills on and off for years because the anxiety and adhd cause me awful insomnia, and a list of mental health professionals that i'd need more than my own fingers and toes to count on, they've STILL awarded me nothing. This doesn't give me great hope for the appeal/tribunal process, and i honestly have no idea where to start with regards filling in the appeal form. This is especially hard right now whilst having ADHD that's currently unmedicated because of the national medication shortage.  
If any fellow ADHDers, or people with these mental health conditions who've won their appeals could offer any advice, support, zoom call to help me or literally anything, i'd be very appreciative because i'm really stressed about it now, especially as i only have 2 weeks left to appeal because their letter (dated 21st december) only arrived yesterday, so that's already cost me a couple of weeks of my 1 month time limit, which i hardly think is fair.

1918663,Anxiety,2024-01-08,Muscles ache when I relax,"So I suffer from pretty bad tensing/ armouring - I hold my breathe and tense up my body especially my stomach. I have noticed that I get a lot of pain in my stomach, chest area and upper back.

1917oio,Anxiety,2024-01-08,Vistaril is a life saver—does it mean SSRI’s are a good sign,"This might be a weird question and regardless I’m going to the doctor tomorrow. I was curious if anyone experienced this.

I have extreme anxiety (Adrenaline surges, insomnia to the point of sleeping maybe an hour a night, constant 10/10 fight or flight that was worse than when my dad was in the hospital dying—like literally seeing wind blow in a tree was triggering to me—why? No clue, I’m just that activated) to the point nothing touches it (meditation, binaural beats, exercise, ACT, DARE, diet, ashwaghanda, gaba, gaba calm, magnesium— literally anything you can think of, yes I tried it). I’m getting a PhD following grief so I have a feeling that my seratonin has been wreaked for a few years but I was just numb to it from working so hard all the time until it got to the adrenaline surges to the point of insomnia.

My doctor prescribed me vistaril (hydroxyzine) and oh my goodness I haven’t felt this normal in months, after one dose. Finally slept through a night.

I’ve never taken SSRIs and have come to realize that I need them desperately (I swore I’d never go on meds but when wind blowing in a tree triggers you…), however since the vistaril is working so good, should I go on SSRIs? Again I know I’ll talk to a doc tomorrow, but if anyone has any background with this. 

It’s my understanding that vistaril helps with serotonin levels, so I’m hoping that means I’m a good candidate for SSRIs (I’ve seen lexapro is generally well tolerated but again that’s up to the doc, though I have a few friends good on it so I’ll try advocating for that). It says I can’t take vistaril more than 4 months which is why I’m looking for long term use while I finish my program.

I just hope whatever I get works like this because it’s been so nice not crying over wind in a tree."

I've been trying to figure out if this is related to anxiety or not - I've been having achey/squeezing pains in my arms which are accompanied by a feeling of coolness/tingling, as well as a sensation like pins and needles, but less intense. I've had tingling in my arms with panic attacks, but this is less of a tingling, more of a sort of spreading coolness. Has anyone else experienced this with anxiety?

I recently have been having a lot of struggles anxiety wise, mostly related to health. I’ve had random moments almost every other day where I feel dizzy, nauseous, lightheaded, tingling sensation all over the body, headaches, etc. When these symptoms really get bad I take .25 mg Xanax that’s been prescribed to me for Panic Attacks and moments of high anxiety. Within a half hour, my anxiety almost fully goes away, and so do the physical symptoms 95% of the time. 

My biggest question is: if Xanax makes these physical symptoms go away, how likely does that mean that it was all related to anxiety. Has anyone else dealt with anything similar? I currently have more anxiety about my health because of all the physical symptoms, and I’ve sort of become a hypochondriac at times with health anxiety."
1916st1,Anxiety,2024-01-07,i had a severe anxious month scared of dementia,"Last month i had severe stress and anxiety even led me to small psychosis attacks, 1 week it got very bad that i slept for 3 hours only because when i tried to sleep i would start to hallucinate so i started to avoid sleeping because im afraid it would happen again, 
Ever since that month i started to get mad easily, short temper, and sometimes i would feel like smiling but i avoid smiling or laughing now since i read its a sign of dementia also the short temper is a sign of dementia,  and the uncontrolable smiling and laughing,
Could this just be anxiety? Im 17 years old i was diagnosed with adhd at the age of 7, and maybe developed more mental disorders like bpd, and ocd"
1916mxf,Anxiety,2024-01-07,I talked myself out of a panic attack,"For the first time in my life I prevented a panic attack. I don’t get them often, maybe two/three every year, but they make me spiral and it gets so bad I curl up and cry uncontrollably. 

So some background: I went to a psychiatrist 5 months ago for anxiety. (I also now believe I have rejection sensitive dysphoria and have yet to talk to her about that). I walked out being diagnosed with ADHD, depression, and mood swings. I was put on lamotrigine, bupropion, and Ritalin. My psychiatrist told me that my inattentive ADHD is what is causing my anxiety because of overthinking.

I feel so different, less depression symptoms, I don’t get as snappy or frustrated with people. My thoughts are so calm. It felt weird at first but this is actually how normal people feel! No overthinking! 

So my panic attack came because I had Covid, a UTI, was dehydrated, and on my period. It was a rough time. My boyfriend said the slightest thing and I took it as rejection. I shut down and couldn’t hold it in. I layed in bed for the night and my mind wouldn’t stop. It spiraled and I could feel my stomach clenching, my heart ache, and my eyes watering. I was having suicidal thoughts.

I didn’t want it to get worse so I talked to myself in my head like a friend. I told myself that everything would be okay. What my boyfriend said was just sarcasm. He still loves me. I have a comfy bed to lay in with him. We had such a good day watching movies. I love you. I love myself. There’s nothing I can’t do. You’ve been doing so well. The medication has been working and you’ve never been happier. 

It took some time convincing but just like that- my mind listened. I could feel the wave of calm pass over me. It was incredible. It’s never happened before. 

The next day I talked to my bf about what happened and how I felt and he was very understanding and compassionate. It wasn’t that I couldn’t tell him how I felt in the moment, it’s that I didn’t want to upset him or make him hate me (which is my rejection sensitive disphoria talking). 

However, that next day was really bad. I cried so much and for no reason. I think it was my body releasing the stress. At least this time my mind was calm and not racing because of the Ritalin. My bf held me and we waited for it to be over. It was really sucky but I know it could’ve been so much worse.

I don’t know if this is gonna help anybody but it was my experience and I really didn’t believe the advice from my therapist would work. &lt;3"

If there is a disagreement with a complete stranger: someone being rude over nothing or over something petty. I immediately take the high road while inside to deescalate and I feel a flush of guilt, anxiety, fear as if everyone is watching and I am at the wrong. Once it’s over, my mind keeps repeating the incident with a what if scenario of what I should have done. Told them they are wrong, fight back etc.. That, in return, makes me get into other conflicts since my mindset is so focused on a negative interaction. If I try really hard I can push through my anxiety to fight or be just as petty once the scenario arises again with someone. I think my fear is social anxiety and embarrassment.

Yet what I am feeling now takes the cake.

For a few months I felt good, no insomnia or anything serious like that, but during winter break I did experience a crisis related to my self-esteem and spent hours upon hours studying for school and doing work in excess. Tomorrow is the day we go back, and I literally can't. For some reason these couple of days I became consicous of my swallowing when eating, and this evening I became comscious of it all the time.

hi guys i’m (19F) currently struggling with some healthy anxiety related to my heart and blood pressure. i had a moment where i stood up after i was bent over a few minutes and my vision got dark, pounding headache, racing heart, and feeling unbalanced. Im back to normal now, but im getting worried about my blood pressure whether it’s high or low and how that will hurt my overall health ESPECIALLY my heart. i’ve had problems with health anxiety regarding my heart a lot recently and now im convinced that my blood pressure will trigger a heart attack and im sitting here now with a slight headache and my left arm is feeling a little weird so that’s really doing me in. Mind you i have visited the ER 3 or 4 times in the months of November and December and the did very extensive tests the first time they took blood, urine, chest x-rays, CT scan, and ecg/ekg and nothing scary was happening to me and my chart seemed pretty normal. I have become much better at talking myself down from the big scary heart attack that i’m definitely not having, but right now i’m second guessing myself i’m saying “maybe this time it’s real what if you talk yourself down but it turns out you were in danger?” i don’t know how to get out of that and i can’t really tell between my physical anxiety symptoms, or if something is really happening to me and it’s exhausting. i have seemingly been dying from this same heart attack time and time again."
1915pz3,Anxiety,2024-01-07,Had a panic attack and haven't felt right since,"So I (20M) have always struggled a little bit with anxiety throughout school. This lead to drug use and partying. Once i graduated from high school I got clean and sober, and started working on myself. I exercise frequently, and I try my best to get out in the world even though it made me anxious. However, I got a girlfriend about a year ago. She crashed her car in June, and she had me practically live with her so I could take her to and from work every day, while I also worked. Then in August, college started up. 

I was getting about 4 hours of sleep every day, and working 10+ hours a day, then coming home and working on her car, then staying up to do college. This lead to the most massive mental breakdown/panic attack I've ever had. 6+ hours of straight unstoppable panic. I laid at home crying until I was taken to the hospital. They gave me Ativan and I fell asleep. 

I went home and took a week off of work, changed my schedule to only work 40 hours. Got my girlfriends car working, and was able to sleep in my own bed. It took me about a month to recover from the pretty consistent panic attacks. It's been 3 months since the panic attacks have mostly stopped. Now I just have this tense, anxious feeling pretty much all the time. Leaving the house makes me dizzy with anxiety, which is infuriating. I am an extrovert at heart, and want to be with people, but my anxiety has me in shackles.

I tried to take 3 days to go stay in a hotel in a nice mountain town, and all 3 days I had panic attacks at the hotel. I knew this was going to happen, but I wanted exposure therapy to show me that things actually were alright. It didn't seem to work. I just want to know if this will ever go away? Or if my brain has just permanently rewired itself and I will never enjoy going out again. It's been such a struggle to try and do the things I love, and it makes me want to cry. I used to love the feeling of adventure, but now it makes my stomach turn thinking about going anywhere. I'm just curious if there is recovery in my future, or if this is my life now."
1915lzm,Anxiety,2024-01-07,Health Anxiety Please Help -,Hi everyone. I was taking out the trash today and a used tampon with dry blood fell to my floor. I didn’t know what it was so picked it up and realized what it was. I’ve been seeing a gal and didn’t know she was even on her period but she threw it in trash. I got a bit of dry blood on my finger and immediately washed it off. However I realized I was barefoot with a crack in my toe and also I have some small razor marks in my skin on my thumb from removing hair from my razor. Not deep marks. I’m a bit paranoid around blood and was wondering if there is any probability of getting hepatitis or something from the blood. Thanks.

I’m not necessarily scared of growing up just that my life will fall apart in college. I am extremely on top of my grades with straight A’s but still have no idea what I want to study or pursue after highschool. I think I want to go to college out of city but I’m afraid I won’t be able to be alone. I feel like I am still super dependent on my parents and not sure how I will manage without them. Im also an introvert and scared I wont be able to make friends in college. Sorry if I’m just rambling but I just need some words of affirmations or advice.
1915i5t,Anxiety,2024-01-07,Is long term use of hydroxyzine dangerous?,I've been taking 25mg hydroxyzine for close to 3 years. I started taking it because my anxiety was turning into a panic disorder and I felt helpless. I've read online that this medication is not meant to be taken for more than 4 months yet my Doctor has chose to keep refilling it for 3 years. The day before yesterday I started having heart palpitations. Really bad heart palpitations. To the point every three beats it would happen and that would last for minutes sometimes. And sometimes when that happens my heart feels like its combining the beats because its going so fast it slows down out of nowhere.. Which is extremely scary. I know this may be due to my anxiety but I'm worried because I've read online that hydroxyzine can cause an irregular heartbeat/other issues. I'm terrified and obviously don't want to keep taking it because of the risks but I'm also scared of what my anxiety is going to do to me if I don't take it. Any and all advice and help would be greatly appreciated. I am going to try to see my doctor tomorrow.

1915dqn,Anxiety,2024-01-07,I don’t know what to do anymore,"So I have extreme anxiety all the time with panic attacks. I struggle with DPDR and panic disorder and depression. For the las few months I was pretty okay, working everyday and going to the gym and classes. Recently I got the flu and stayed home for a few days but my panic attacks and everything went into overdrive. Im not sick anymore but I have constant panic attacks, DPDR, and I have no appetite. I barely eat and when I really need to I have to force it down my throat. Nothing brings me any joy anymore and I always feel like doing absolutely nothing. I can’t concentrate or think at all and everything feels weird and unreal. The other day I just payed on the couch half awake all day and did absolutely nothing else just feeling numb. The only reason I was able to force myself up is because my mom was getting upset. My memory sucks and I can’t remember anything from the last few days. I take sertraline and used to take paroxetine but it doesn’t seem to do anything at all. I don’t know what to do anymore and I can’t stay like this or I will lose my mind completely."
19152mk,Anxiety,2024-01-07,How do I stop monitoring my heart rate?,"My heart rate has been my main problem with my anxiety lately. I’ve been monitoring my heart rate several times a day. It’s always the same thing — 88 bpm, except when I’m anxious or walking. I don’t always use my Apple Watch since it’s broken and sometimes it gives incorrect readings. I know how to check my heart manually but I can’t stop doing it. It’s affecting me a lot. Sometimes I get so worried over my heart that my heart starts beating fast. I’ve been sleeping in a lot and falling asleep late but now that winter break’s over for me I can’t do that anymore. I’ve been having trouble sleeping over a bad fear of dying in my sleep. I started having panic attacks in September, but ever since November, I’ve been more anxious than usual. Every time I get over a health-related fear, a new health-related fear comes up. I had about two weeks with my only fear being a manageable fear of sleep until I accidentally came across a heart-related video a week ago. That video reminded me about heart rates. I need to stop doing this because it’s really affecting my sleep. The only reason I’ve been getting 8 hours of sleep is because I was able to sleep in during the break."

19144u5,Anxiety,2024-01-07,It can get better!,"I (27F) have had social anxiety since I was in my early adolescence. I just wanted to make a post sharing that it CAN get better. Some recent milestones I've hit: 

- Sent something back at a restaurant (a pint that had something floating in it 🤢)
- Exchanged some pants I got for Christmas that didn't fit me for something I like a lot more. Old me would have just held onto those pants until they inevitably get donated to goodwill. 

I also have (almost) no issues with calling and making medical appointments for myself, something that literally made me cry in my early 20s (and avoid important medical stuff like routine dentist appointments, pap smears, and stuff that just improves my wellbeing overall like therapy, massage, etc.). 

I wanted to make this post because (a) I know this community will understand that these things that are seemingly insignificant to regular people feel like HUGE accomplishments to me, and (b) to encourage people who are struggling and feel like there's no hope to getting better."

1913b55,Anxiety,2024-01-07,I feel extremely overwhelmed,"I’m pretty sure I’m insulin resistant and it’s really overwhelming me. 

I’ve gained 30 pounds in a short amount of time (about 4-5 months). I have never gained that much weight that fast ever. I am overweight obviously. I developed agoraphobia august 2022 and became pretty inactive. This year I’ve had days where I haven’t even gotten 500 steps in. I just don’t know what to do. 

I’m very overwhelmed trying to change my diet. I already eat way less sugar and carbs but it’s a lot trying to figure out protein, fiber, and all the other nutrients. Also my issue is that whenever my blood sugar goes under 90 my chest has this awful feeling and most of the time all I want to do is eat quick carbs to make the pain stop. Like it’s hard to meal plan when I get this pain and just want to make it stop. This whole issue is just extremely overwhelming. I’m also worried that it’s too late and I’m going to get type 2 diabetes from this. My dad had type 2 diabetes as well. 

I just want to be healthy but I’m afraid it’s too late for me. My doctor also isn’t taking me seriously so I’m getting absolutely no help with this. My mom doesn’t understand. I just feel really alone. I’m only 19 and really want to be healthy and live my life. I don’t want to die or have diabetes."

So i'm on my own with no support, no positive voice in my head and all I want to do is chuck myself out the nearest window..but I can t' because that would kill my parents and as a Christian, I can't commit suicide.

19129nc,Anxiety,2024-01-07,I know what I'd like to possibly do as a career/extra income but severely struggling to commit,"This is just one of my many problems but the current one I'd like to maybe get some advice on. Without the major backstory the basics is that I have on and off played around with the idea of using my writing degree and love of crafting to run a blog. The niche, so to speak, that I landed on was one dedicated to making closet cosplays or casual cosplays since I know how expensive cosplay is. Something that makes me anxious whenever I think about doing a cosplay ngl, alongside where to store an expensive cosplay since we have a small house.

One of the reasons I also struggle and get panic attacks whenever I try to actually make progress on setting up this dream blog is while I do have a ""craft room"" it's a fucking slob mess and I know presentation is important in blogs and I live in a secluded area so I feel like any photoshoots I'd do might end up having to be in my house. Plus I already struggle with my self image with body dysmorphia sometimes if I see a picture of myself. Doing cosplay has been my way with coping with this, hence why I wanna try to focus on it as a way to better work to overcome this issue. Not only that but with my craft room, whenever I try to figure out where to start cleaning I get overwhelmed and just don't do it.  


My other struggle is trying to even plan content for this blog that I'd like to have set up before I launch to give myself some stuff to post. I only have a few solid ideas, at least imo, since due to my money anxiety (I am very money conscious) I struggle to spend the money to buy the things needed to make a few projects. Granted with my current job, right now I'm making better progress in this field (assuming the comment about me leaving in a month isn't a hint to me getting fired, which is a whole other issue).  


I do wanna try to commit to starting the blog, regardless if it makes money or not, since family members and my therapist think it'd be a good way to help with my massive anxiety and depression. But I still get overwhelmed trying to make any progress and I'm honestly terrified of trying to ask for help over on the r/Blogging subreddit.

Sorry for the long post. Just not really sure who to talk to who might be able to give me solid advice on what to do. Also I struggle with ADHD if that matters

TL/DR: I wanna start a blog about sewing closet/casual cosplays but I'm struggling to commit."
191208u,Anxiety,2024-01-07,Cannot Get Out Of My Own Head,"I will try to make this as short as possible but I truly just need any type of advice / reassurance / unbiased opinions. Anything to let me know that this isn't the end of the world and I will be okay no matter what happens. 

Back in March of 2023 I was laid off for the first time in my career. It was equal parts terrifying and depressing especially because I was living in a super HCOL city and my student loans and other bills are very high. I was lucky enough to find a new position in May of 2023 after applying to over 450 jobs. It was brutal but I made it through, though I took a 30% cut in salary because I really just needed health insurance again and to pay my bills if nothing else. 

Fast forward to today and I am still in my new role which I am enjoying, but it is with a startup and the environment can be a bit volatile. For my end of year review, my manager let me know that work is going to slow down significantly in 2024 and they're going to need me to work on other projects across the organization to fill my time. This makes me so uneasy because what if I'm not good at the new tasks? What if I can't pick up the new work as easily? The question that haunts me -- what if they just end up laying me off again? I want to be in a role where I can feel fulfilled and satisfied and doing meaningful work. I feel like I should start looking for a new job but it all seems so daunting. 

For context: I am a technical recruiter with over 8 years of experience but the job market has been HORRENDOUS over the past 18 months or so. Mass layoffs have been happening across all of the tech industry and when you apply to a role, you're easily competing with thousands of others who are in the same boat. 

I've been having some serious anxiety about work lately. I have very little appetite, not able to sleep and just doom scroll on my phone for hours and hours. It may seem silly, but my biggest fear is not being able to pay my bills and ruining my credit. I know there are more important things in life, but this situation is eating me alive and I truly think I have some sort of PTSD from my layoff last year. I probably should look into therapy because this feeling is consuming me.

Sorry for the huge rant, I just truly am not sure how to feel better at this point. Prior to being laid off, I never had these thoughts or feelings when it pertained to work."

Is it a thing to have a prescription solely for when you feel a panic attack coming on? If so, what have you taken and how well does it work? 

I just had my most recent attack last night and it was straight heart palpitations for 2 hours and I couldn’t breathe. I tried cold water, magnesium glycinate, finally melatonin kicked in and I passed out. 

I only get them like once a month. The melatonin takes too long.

All my life I have had anxiety when I am ""stuck"" somewhere.  At weddings, at my college and high school graduation.. at previous ceremonies I always suffered a panic attack.   This will require me to sit on stage for about an hour or so... get the award and give a quick speech.   I am absolutely terrified of this.    It has consumed me for months thinking about it and fearing I will have a massive panic attack... puke... or pass out ( I have never actually passed out from one but it felt like I could).

19113br,Anxiety,2024-01-07,Would buspar be a good option to help with what I am going through? Any advice appreciated,"Would buspar be a good option to help with what I am going through? Any advice appreciated  
I am a 23 year old 6' 160 pound male with anxiety, asthma and have dealt with some post concussion issues in the past,  
Long story short I have had gad and ocd for quite a few years now but during my adult life was able to get it down to where I had a full active life with no significant day to day impediments from anxiety.  
Over the summer I started struggling a lot with asthma/breathing which reignited my anxiety and became a very vicious cycle where the anxiety and asthma brought each other on and continuously made each other worse which caused me to be very avoidant in day to day life. But still my baseline anxiety like when I was home or doing something relaxing outside or etc was fine and many days I was really not too bad at all. Panic/stress was only brought on by very stressful health or real world situations (intense physical exertion, large crowds, oral presentations, dates).  
About 6-8 weeks ago my anxiety exploded seemingly out of nowhere and my baseline anxiety has been suffocatingly bad since then. Its rare that I have days where it goes down below a 6-7/10 even when I am just at home trying to relax. I have constant feelings of despair, fear, panic which manifest as awful physical sensations and I am also always extremely tense, jittery, restless, etc. It is awful.  
I have started therapy again and have been coping with meditation, exercise, benadryl and klonopin 1-2 times per week and have been improving a little bit compared to when this whole thing started a couple months ago but the progress isnt meaningful enough to where I can return to my former life and I am getting desperate because I am starting the next semester of uni in a week and feel like I will have to drop out if I dont improve significantly.  
I am now open to taking a medication but am afraid of ssri due to potentially permanent sexual side effects (PSSD) and potential long term dependance (i dont want to be on a medication super long term since this feels more like an accute issue). Would Buspar be something which could potentially help me? I just need something which will calm me down and take the edge off enough to begin pushing myself more and more through exposure/reintegration back into my 'old' life of school, work, hanging with friends, dating, etc."

Last night this happened so I shot out of bed coughing and trying to breathe, but I wasn't fully awake. So I started having nightmares that I was dying, it probably only lasted a few seconds but it felt like at least a minute. When I finally snapped out of it my my heart rate was going crazy so I went into the bathroom to catch my breathe and I was weak/shaky. I finally calmed down enough to go back to sleep. I checked my Fitbit and this all happened around 5AM, last 30 minutes with a peak heart rate of 110. Would this be considered a panic attack or does it sound like something else?"

Is anyone else experiencing this? Or has anyone ever experienced this? Or get email anxiety? "

If I ignore it, will it just go away?"
1910ag0,Anxiety,2024-01-07,Constant heart palpitations(?) and urges to hit myself.,"Hi, so I don't know exactly what I am looking for or how to deal with the problems I have so I only wanted to see if anyone here has more experience or knowledge of something like it or similar.

For as long as I can remember I've had problems with anxiety, it's something I've gone to therapy for long enough for them to apparently give up on me or at least feel like I don't need any help(?).
I went through a couple ECT and later TMS during the therapy was forcefully held at the clinic for a year or so (can't remember because of the ECT). Somewhere along the line I started to get these heart palpitations(?) that came and went randomly. I talked to the doctors about it but they didn't really care much about it and just did an ECG, which didn't find anything abnormal.

These palpitations feels weird though, they are definitely not consistant and I have no way of predicting when or how often they occure which I guess msde it hard to treat. 
The only thing that I know for sure about them is that they can feel like 1-5 strong heartbeats, I always ""hear"" them in my ears and almost always makes it a bit harder for me to breathe while it beats. Some extra strong once have occure which made me lose focus and a bit of my sight but those are really rare. 
Oh and these are basically constant with an interval of a few seconds to minutes, random intensity throughout everyday.


I think that should cover everything important so with all that said.
Have anyone else felt something similar to this, is it something I need to worry about or do I just have to accept and deal with this for the rest of my life?"

190zliz,Anxiety,2024-01-07,Tightness in Diaphragm? SOB When Standing?,"Hello! Long time anxiety sufferer here!! Last night I had one of the worst nights I've had in a while, panic wise. 

For clarity sake, I have a really, really bad stomach. I swear something isn't right with my sympathetic nervous system like she is very overreactive. I also have GERD, and am on PPIs and cannot eat alot. I'm also on Prozac and Hydroxyzine. 

Well last night I must have waited too long to eat and my stomach got b l o a t e d. Which lead to SOB, which lead to a massive panic attack where I could literally NOT BREATHE if I was standing up. It felt like my stomach was so tight that it just couldn't extend, or I just couldn't breathe around something in there. I was hyperventilating and my vision was blurry amd I felt like if I didn't sit or lay down I would never catch my breath. 

I've had this before, unfortunately, and my SPO2 is always perfect, and I guess I'm just wondering if anyone else get a debilitating symptom like that? Eventually I had to force myself to stand and get my calm down pill, and the pressure did eventually go, but today it lingers a bit and I want to know that I'm not alone. 

My mother has actually been rushed to the hospital many times for the same exact feeling, and every single time they tell her it's her stomach, so I may have inherited that from her- but I am still very shaken up and curious if anyone else suffers from this, and if you do- how the FUCK do you manage it?"

Does this seem right? I would think since it got smaller it would get better but it hasn’t? Also this eye constantly gets goopy/watery at night now.  I also have astigmatism and PVD in this eye so see a big floater too.  Is this concerning?

190zb50,Anxiety,2024-01-07,"Can't stop hyper-focusing on my breathing and chest, I'm exhausted","Basically the title. Feels like for the past month or so I've been extremely aware and focused on my breathing and literally any sensation (or even lack thereof) in my chest and it's making me feel like I'm going insane.

&amp;#x200B;

I've gone to the ER twice and been told both times that they see nothing wrong with my heart or lungs or anything, but my mind is always like ""what if they missed something or didn't run a certain test."" And of course this focus on my breathing makes me go into panic attacks or near panic attacks because it *always* feels like something isn't right. And breathing exercises feel like they rarely work because that makes me focus even harder on my breathing and notice anything that I think is weird or feels weird. And it feels like nothing will feel ""normal"" at this rate. If I breathe too heavily, that's concerning. If I stop breathing heavily, I become aware of that too. If my heart is beating too fast, something is wrong. If I can't feel my heartbeat or my chest feels ""empty"" then that's just as concerning. Nothing makes me feel comfortable.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm in therapy now (I have an appointment today even) and am seeing a psychiatrist again, trying to tell myself that it's just my anxiety giving me these feelings and concerned and that there's nothing to actually panic about, but man it's tough and I'm getting sick of it."

I think my poor breathing habits (mouth breathing, rapid, shallow, chest)) is the cause of all my woes.  Its hard to change your breathing.  
I put a piece of tape by my mouth during the day (in the house) to remind me to keep it shut and a stick on heat pad on my abdomen to keep it warm so I don't tighten it up - makes it easier to remember to drag those breaths all the way down - past the chest.

It was a review of a product related to a game I play.  
Less than 5 minutes later someone commented essentially 'this is stupid and pointless so I won't watch it' and idk, I've just not been doing well in general, they down voted the post and my comments, and it shouldn't bother me but it did because I worked on it for a long time and they were rude AF without even bothering to watch it.   
I know it's dumb to be upset over that but it just hit me at a bad time and it was the only response I got to the video at all so I just deleted it and every other video on my youtube. And then I deleted my reddit account because I figured, everyone else also thinks this is a pointless video and theyre just nice enough not to say anything about it.  
It's a popular subreddit so I know lots of people see what's posted on there, but nobody came to my defense and that bothered me a lot because I have done nothing even remotely wrong and I got downvoted when I tried to defend myself. (On a side note, this particular sub prides itself in being accepting and welcoming but there is little or no pushback when someone decides not to be)

I have recently been struggling with agoraphobia in certain context. I am currently traveling through Europe with my partner and we spend a lot of time in nature. Every now and then when we go on hikes and that is when I sometimes get panick attacts. What triggers it are wide and high open spaces. I start to feel like the space overwhelms me and I cannot hold onto anything. I feel an intense urge to hide somewhere. I used to have episodes like that when I was younger in the mountains or in a spacious building like churches but they were very rare and didn't bother me that much. Now they happen quite regularly and I would deeply appreciate if you could share whether you ever struggled with anything like that and what helped you overcome it. Any book recomendations?

*I need to add that my anxiety disorder got much worse when 9 months ago I quit Cymbalta cold-turkey, which now I know was a big mistake. After that I struggled with intense agoraphobia a lot but it seemed to subside after a few months only to come back now. 

Thank you for your help and I send you a lot of light and love in the new year &lt;3"

I’ve seen posts in here with dosages that are lower than mine and talk about taking the edge off at least. So far, mine have done nothing. I feel a failure. I’ve tried Valium, Xanax and hydroxzine. They’ve made me feel a little tired, but during take off or turbulence, I’m still white knuckled and trying to count in my head, use other distractions. I just want to be able to travel comfortably. Now even planning flights has me anxious. 

For more context, its genesis is PTSD. I had an extremely stressful flight with an emergency landing. Like the woman next to me was praying the rosary and screaming she didn’t want to die. The next flight I took, our landing was all over the runway in Paris. The flight attendant said she’d never experienced a worse landing. I know I was just unlucky. I didn’t super enjoy flying before that, but I didn’t have major issues with it until after those two incidents. I’ve flown a a half dozen times since (with meds) and it’s still a nightmare. I hate how it’s preventing me from so many wonderful opportunities.

I keep getting anxiety attacks but its like the symptoms keep changing every time I find a new solution to them. 

For example, when the anxiety first started I felt numb all over, almost like de realisation. Then I got obsessed with my heartbeat, and began hearing it all the time. Once I got over that, I started getting loads of visual snow. I still get that but not as much. Then I started feeling like I couldn’t breathe properly or my throat was swollen, but like way way intenser than usual . That happened last night and I’m still getting to grips that it was just anxiety. 

Basically, I get some anxiety symptom which I’ll get stressed over for 1-3 days, and learn to deal with it. Then once I’ve dealt with it, I just start experiencing some new symptom instead until I get over that.

I’m not sure why but even at home where I’m safe I always have anxiety sometimes, mostly when home alone. My parents understand my anxiety and are willing to help me get resources or help me get therapy if I need it (at the moment I’m not in it yet) so they are not the cause of it and same with my siblings they aren’t either. When my parents are home I feel okay, with my siblings I semi feel okay but if I’m the oldest in the house than I get a little sponge my younger siblings expect me to like be the bigger person. 

But when I’m home alone I always have a bad feeling like someone will be at my house just like “lurking” and like trying to stalk me or whoever at my house. I mean no one in my family has a stalker and I sure don’t to me knowledge no one is/has but I always have that bad feeling. Or like someone would try to spy on me at my own house and the big one that probably won’t happen someone trying to break into my house. 

Now in my neighbourhood that stuff is like impossible no crimes or anything like that has been committed in my neighbourhood, but my anxiety always says like it’ll happen and I get scared. As well if I’m home alone and the doorbell rings I get scared and don’t answer and wait until they leave. We have a doorbell camera so that can help if anything happens or we what to see who’s at the door, but sometimes I find myself checking it way too much when my anxiety is high. 

The only way this doesn’t happen is if I’m out of my house. I’m in school so sometimes I stay with my grandma since she lives closer to my campus. She lives in an apartment that is meant for older people (like older people who don’t need 24/7 care and can be independent) and so I have a key to get in and to her apartment she got from the superintendent there, it’s common for some children or grandchildren of the people have it just in case. But I almost feel safer there or anywhere else like my other grandparents house who I visit from time to time and it the same when I’m at my partners house and friends houses, but it’s always at my home.

I’m just wondering what things can I do to help keep piece of mind at home and not make my anxiety think that someone is around my house? Any advice is appreciated."

190uyt2,Anxiety,2024-01-07,Does life with health anxiety ever get better?,"27F

It's been a year since I developed health anxiety that makes my life suck. Every day I manage to find a symptom to think about (probably many of them are anxiety-induced, so it's a vicious circle). 
Got meds prescriptions but it didn't make any drastic effect.
My mood gets worse after sunset and every evening I have at least one thought about feeling unwell, fear of death etc. 
Sometimes even something health/death related in books or movies makes me feel worse (and it wasn't like this before, I always was pretty okay with everything scary or gory).
My main concern now is that it will never get better. If I'm feeling like this at 27 being relatively healthy, how will my life be when I get older? At such a young age I get consumed by anxiety sometimes to a degree that I'm always scared and on high alert when not at home, always checking myself for feeling dizzy/shaky/weird, always thinking about what will happen if I start feeling unwell now and no one will help.
I see people my age just living their lives normally and I'm so afraid I will never get back to my not-anxious happy self and my life will just become worse and worse over time.
Did anyone else here feel like this for a long period of time and then managed to get better? I need happy stories and reassurance to feel better and to feel that I'm not alone in this..."

190p9tn,Anxiety,2024-01-07,Why do I keep having r!pe nightmares if I have never been assaulted?,"TW: rape and sexual assault 

I have a condition called chronic nightmares where I have a nightmare 50% of the time, an actual statistic from multiple months of tracking. 

However one of the more common and re-emerging themes I keep dreaming are of me being sexually assaulted or raped. 

It is never dreaming of the act itself, but rather the situation beforehand or me reacting afterwards. For example tonight I dreamed that the old man from my job was cornering me and it was just about me panicking about what to do, and then it fast forwarded to afterward of me being upset about what happened. 

There is absolutely no possibility of me having been raped as a child unless I was an extremely young child and it happened away from home. I have absolutely no history of sexual assault - not even a single instance. 

Is it likely that I’m just having these dreams due to anxiety? Due to the fact it’s a popular “scary thing”? I think that would make sense considering how the assaulter is always an innocent man I know."

190ur3n,Anxiety,2024-01-07,Hello. I hope someone will read this. I have anxiety almost everyday. I saw last night nightmare about fire burning house.,"Hello. I hope someone will read this. I have anxiety almost everyday. I saw last night nightmare about fire burning house. 

Then today mom sent me message that they forgot stove on about hour. Glad they came home early that everything was ok (little bit smoke was there and fire alarm was on). 

But now I have thinking what if they didnt came early and house could be burn and mom have cats and they were very startled and panicing. I dont know how I can stop thinking that what if thought and would be so anxious :( I'm very glad everyone is safe and that is the most important thing. And sry my english."
190up31,Anxiety,2024-01-07,Weird sensations all over my body,"Hi! I’m writing here because I really am extremely panicky about a sudden new sensation I’m feeling all over my body. I have weird tingling and shooting pains at the back of my head on the left side in one spot and I’m scared what it could be. I don’t even know at this point if I have anxiety but doctors say that I do because of very severe cardiac and breathing symptoms that have no other reasons cz my tests come clean. I learnt to live with that but now with these weird sensations in my head and randomly in my arms and hands are making me so scared. Due to winter I started using a heater, and heating pad 24*7 , with my hands inside the heating pad all the damn time and now it’s causing these sensations I’m scared it’s due to radiation? Google tells me all sorts of things! Can anxiety cause such sensations? Has anyone experienced something similar? Doctor says no need for a scan because it could happen but I’m not convinced as it’s just not going away.
I’d be very grateful to know if anyone else has had such experiences? And how did you deal with it? 

Thank you very much! ❤️"
190uodx,Anxiety,2024-01-07,Overthinking and worrying,"Hi guys,

I was having this dizziness for more than a month and I was seen by 3 doctors saying that it's probably bppv. I wasn't convinced though so I had to private to an audiologist who also told me that my ears are fine and can't be causing this vertigo. She referred me to a specialist ENT and he mentioned that I've got a mild vertigo and by doing a maneuver, it will go away. Still in doubt though. He said that my nerve functionality is fine and there's no need for an MRI. After this maneuver, I don't feel as dizzy but now I've got stiff neck and I also get this burning sensation in my head. I keep thinking about having something worse and none of these doctors know what they're talking about. Is it my anxiety? Has anyone else experienced these symptoms? I can't stop worrying. Shall I still chase doctors up for an MRI? Thank you."
190ugl7,Anxiety,2024-01-07,Anxious and terrified of upcoming US elections/world events,"Ever since the new year came around I've had this overwhelming sense of dread about this year and the future. I live in the US on the East Coast and there's already talk all around me about the upcoming elections and people preparing for the worst and of course since I'm in the South alot of people are getting their firearms ready. This, along with what's going on in the Middle East and Ukraine and China has me struggling to get through my day to day without fear. I just got married last October and I'm very fearful of starting a family in the state the world is in. If anyone knowledgeable in managing these feelings or anyone just wants to chat I would appreciate the support."
190u9cb,Anxiety,2024-01-07,"Parents fighting with agression, it is heartbreaking. It triggers my anxiety so badly!","Hi, I am a female, 26 years old, single child. 

My parents keep fighting a lot. They have a fight almost every other day and they talk in such a bad way with each other. Like mom says I should die instead and then dad says then you should die, why are you still alive and all this nonsense along with cuss words. 

I get triggered, I have anxiety. I always rush to my room. But mom always brings me into the conversation she says me and dad are the same. We work so we are like big people who dont give a fuck about other people including her. Etc etc. 

It is just hurtful. Its their fight, why do I have to first witness such aggression and shitty behaviour and for no reason I become a part of their fight. They drag me which is even more heartbreaking. 

Like everytime, I am crying in my room from the past one hour, my hands are cold, my anxiety is hitting again. I just dont know what to do. I am so tired. So damn tired of all this😭"
190u154,Anxiety,2024-01-07,(TW: DEATH) does anyone else get hit with waves of anxiety about death that hasn't happened yet?,"To clarify, I'm not scared of dying. Rather, I'm abnormally at peace with the concept of mortality, to the degree that it freaks people out. I didn't exist for billions of years before I was born, and I assume it will be the same after I die. I consider life a pleasant holiday from nothingness, a chance the universe gives mindless matter to understand what it is for a while, before it returns to the void.

What I am scared of is loss. My grandparents are aging so much quicker as of late, my grandfather has a prognosis, my grandmother forgets things about her own life all the time. This fear is constant, but obviously gets worse when I'm with them.

Sometimes, though, I get waves of paranoia, usually in the dead of night. My cat is healthy and nine years old, but I am typing this post instead of going to bed, even though I'm exhausted, at 2:00am, because I am so utterly terrified that when I wake up he will not be alive anymore. I have no reason to be scared of this right now, but I'm fighting off a panic attack because I know that one day he will die and I cannot do that. I cannot live without him.

Does anyone else get this way sometimes? I really need to sleep, but I can't. I feel like if I go to sleep, my cat will die."
190thys,Anxiety,2024-01-07,Anybody knows how to deal with this? LONG POST AHEAD,"I (24F) think that I may be suffering from a mild anxiety disorder. Well, to be quite honest, this diagnosis was already established a long while ago. At 8 YO, I was found to be suffering from clinical depression due to Obsessive Compulsive Disorder. Over time, I have been prescribed medication such as Xanax or even Amitryptilline - I suffered from insomnia, got easily stressed or overwhelmed, couldn’t cope with just about everything and even started experiencing pain radiating from the left hand side of my body.

5 months ago, I entered into what I assumed was going to be my dream job. I quickly found that I was embarking on a much different boat with a lot of responsibilities and expectations into a whole other field. Now don’t get me wrong, I love all the good things my job does for me: financial independence, structure, discipline, exposure to real life and real world problems.

However, I am EXTREMELY anxious over everything that’s related to my work environment. I am scared of fucking up, scared of making mistakes and I feel like I just can’t seem to adapt to the situation. While the workplace might seem keen on keeping me as part of the workforce, I can’t help but live in anticipation of every single shred of slight criticism that I may face. 

I know that in all job places, there will always be something to work on, room for improvement, things to get better at. I know that for a fact. And I know that, well, sometimes, things may be rough but it’s all a learning process. Especially for someone who’s training to be part of the field: responsibilities and expectations are much more elevated. However, I can’t help but feel like I’m living in limbo.

To be brutally honest, there are numerous evenings or even mornings where I find myself crying before work begins. I literally live in the anticipation of remarks, of being told that I’ve been working months at this job and I still can’t seem to do something good out of it, that I’m sometimes slowing down the work process because other more experienced team members have to teach me how to do things right, that I’ve been delegated the smoothest tasks out of the basket and that I still seem to be struggling.

What can I do about all this? How can I reduce this level of anxiety while also developing sharper skills at work? How can I grow thick skin towards this? While people may say that quitting is an option, I’m 24, this is my third job, but admittedly the first one where I earn an actual salary, where I am confronted with far greater responsibilities and where I am promised a certain level of security. 

How can I work on myself?

P.S: Thank you for reading my post and helping me out. You are important and you are loved. All the best."
190thqm,Anxiety,2024-01-07,Anxiety nausea,Does anyone else get bad anxiety nausea? Every day before work or before I do anything that causes anxiety I immediately feel nauseous and I honestly wish my body would just puke instead of feeling sick for the fun of it. Atleast then it feels real and not just some weird part of me that makes situations even more unbearable.
190tet8,Anxiety,2024-01-07,Opipramol - my experience,"I just answered a couple of different, older questions about this drug which, whilst common in Europe is not at all common in the US it seems but sems to be becoming more widely prescribed. It is an older anti-depressant that was found to have better anxiolytic effects. Read more here: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opipramol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opipramol) 

Anyway, here's my experience as I have a seen a few questions/ posts seeking advice about it and I have extensive experience of its use, take what is useful, I hope it helps someone.

I was first prescribed Opipramol by my GP (PCP) 4 years ago and took 100-0-100, it definitely had a calming effect on my anxiety (GAD with panic episodes) pretty quickly. I had suffered with anxiety mildly since I was a late teen but in the previous 5 years it had been peaking. At the point of prescription, the anxiety was acute and becoming unbearable. The evening dose initially helped with sleep (definitely the falling asleep part, I still woke 1 - 2 times a night occasionally but previously I had an inability to fall asleep plus waking up 2-5 times pretty much every night). And I definitely had a reduction in anxiety, it was like that 'feeling' (you all know what I mean)  started to feel 'further away' from me ... like I was mildly aware of it but not bothered by it.  It seemed to mask it somehow, I hope that makes sense... But in summary I was happy with the effect. I stopped jumping at sudden noises, mildly stopped  catastrophizing - I was enamoured of the meds for sure after having the GAD for too long especially the catastrophizing.  
  
Long story short, due to a separate issue I stopped taking it (traumatic bereavement and intense grief, very badly handled).  I stopped because I started drinking ***a*** ***lot due*** to this and I learned that acute alcohol intoxication is contra-indicated (I found out the hard way) and so I stopped after a little less than a year. A year/year and half later I started again (same dose) after I had cut down the alcohol ***a lot.***.. then later stopped drinking completely . The effects are much better, I was taking it for anxiety mostly but the (light) anti-depressant effect kicked in this time after about 6/8 months (felt this more acutely after I quit the booze entirely) and I've now been taking it for almost 2 years this cycle with no side effects and no decrease in its (subjective) function. Again, the slow reduction of drinking then being teetotal may have skewed the results but I can say that for me 100-0-100 dose has both entirely eliminated the general anxiety and I catastrophize very rarely these days.  It has also made me generally happier overall. Stopping booze is also a game changer for anxiety and depression generally. 

I also just re-read the potential side effects through and can say that for me, I had none of the rare effects and the 'fairly common' one I had was a dry nose/mucus. I don't know for how long I will take it (or for how long it is advised, my German doctor who has been prescribing this to many patients for multiple years isn't concerned about very long term use) and I feel better that it has lower/virtually no anti-cholinergic effects, though I would rather it had zero. 

Living with anxiety isn't something I'd wish on my worst enemy so I like to help where I can, of course YMMV but sharing FWIW. "
190tdht,Anxiety,2024-01-07,Fear of taking sertraline!,"I’ve had anxiety and panic attacks for around 2 years and been fighting to not take meds but last 3/4 days been very intense severe panic attacks sh*t sure I can’t breath and going to die etc etc so now im looking at the sertraline docs have given me and thinking it could be the answer but I’m worried about bad side effects I’m not sure I could cope with feeling any worse than I do right now ,

190t7pr,Anxiety,2024-01-07,Zoloft and exhaustion + brain fog,"I’ve been on 50mg for 5 months. Prior to starting Zoloft, I’d wake up at 5am to exercise in the morning. As soon as I started talking Zoloft that stopped because I feel absolutely exhausted each morning. I would go as far as to say that Zoloft makes me feel drugged when I first wake up. It doesn’t matter what time of day I take it at. I’ve tried morning, afternoon and night. 

Is there anything I can do to get rid of the exhaustion and brain fog? I asked my doc to try Wellbutrin and she said no because she is worried the Wellbutrin will make my anxiety worse."
190t2pj,Anxiety,2024-01-07,Thank you for the support,"(Potential TW as could refer to self harm)

I have come back to this subreddit after some decent time. I don't exactly remember why I came here initially all I do know is that this group is why I started actually seeing a real doctor and got my diagnosis and pills post my mental health crisis and my breaking point above four or so years back. 

I do remember the sept of 2020 was particularly my darkest period for me to the point of me forcing myself away from tall ledges or sharp things like knifes and one night after meticulous planning the least painful to go out. I don't want to go into the details of it. I didn't go through because I knew my grandmother died because of COVID and the entire nightmare scenarios that was there in the initial wave. I had seen what it did to my mother and I couldn't let her have two tragedies in one horrible year. And so I waited and said if by next year I am not in a better spot I would reconsider and so I visited a therapist and got the courage to open up to a stranger.

I remember crying after getting a panic disorder, GAD and MDD disorder because I finally understood what was wrong . I wasn't cursed, I just have to train my brain again to not misfire.I can have a plan to try to sort it out. While easier said than done and the side effects were some of the most psychologically challenging things I had to face, time goes by and with medication, help and just learning to love and listen myself, my problems weren't as bad as I made them out to be. They were just lies I told myself. 

Since that fateful winter night of me looking outside the window ledge of my balcony, I remebet the ""promise"" I keep breaking in my state of crisis and while my problems were quite tough, I needed a perspective shift. I am still an anxious meat bag holding organs but I'm way better than being too overwhelmed to even breathe. I'm getting better and getting through my own demons of my own making. 

If it wasn't for that post I had seen in this subreddit so many years ago as well as one kind random person DM me to calm me down when I lost my mind, I could have potentially delayed my treatment even longer and increase the struggles I inflicted on myself for no real reason. 

So thank you"
190t23j,Anxiety,2024-01-07,failed 1 class &amp; can’t get my diploma,"lmfao. literally walked for my graduation because my school let me (they usually do bc 9/10 times in situations like this, most students can still complete their degree in the next semester).

My school told me financial aid can only grant me a pell grant of $700 and I can’t have a loan bc it’s one course. I can’t start my new post grad job (which I fucking needed to survive) bc of this. I lost my financial educational benefits that was helping me live day to day. I quit my serving and bartending job bc I was about to start my salary job, literally started training and lost it. I was one fucking class away from my degree. I have no way to afford school anymore. Who knows how long it will take to save up for one semester for one fucking class. My counselor told me straight up “students in this position have no options, you have to pay upfront by Monday or you will be dropped”. I’m not entitled, just disappointed and mad.

To me, it’s a mostly negative feeling but there’s lines of positivity due to it really drilling in how much I care about this person. 

The end result is smatterings of emotions across the days of the week. Might be feeling sad, hopeless, eager, content, hopeful, weak, energized, tough…sometimes a weird mix of them all. The end result of that soupy mess is good old anxiety.

194816w,Anxiety,2024-01-11,"You aren’t as important as you think you are, but you are much more valuable than you think you are.","With anxiety, it’s easy to fall into traps of worrying that people are judging you. It could be at the store. Do people not like me for whatever reason? Did I do something stupid that they noticed? Can they tell I’m kind of freaking out in my head?  It could be at work. Does my supervisor think I’m incompetent? Do my coworkers? Do they like me? If I make a mistake could it be catastrophic for me or the company? 

It comes up in so many places. But the good news is you aren’t that important. People have their owns issues going on.  They don’t have time to concern themselves with your actions. I can’t remember what I did at work a week ago and I lived it. It doubt other people remember. I went to the store and saw dozens of people shopping. I don’t remember any of them and they don’t remember me. It doesn’t stick around because it’s not that important. 

But you are much more valuable than you think.  With anxiety we can be very self critical. We look at the negatives and beat ourselves up for being weak or stupid.  But that’s not true. You are strong. You have inherent value as a person. You deserve to treat yourself as valuable. If you need help, whether it’s at work or with a mental health issues, you have the right to ask for it and deserve to get it. You have the right to be treated with compassion, both externally and internally. You have the right to say no.  You have the right to pursue what you want for your life. You deserve love and should treat yourself with love. You don’t have to do anything to earn these rights. You have them now! So work on taking advantage of them. Work on cutting yourself some slack. Work I’m seeing the value you have. Treat yourself with self compassion. You are trying your best"

I always get anxious when traveling but I really HAVE to go to this trip since we do it every year I haven’t been able to go the last 3 years with my whole family. I just don’t think I can. I was feeling good about it yesterday but today I woke up nauseous and my heartbeat is fast. Normal symptoms for me but they scare the crap out of me because im scared im going to have a heart attack or something severe. Im scared of getting there and being so anxious that i wont be able to eat or sleep or do anything and be so anxious that I won’t be able to get myself back. The fear of getting stuck somewhere comes from when I was in pre school going to the bathroom and the toilet just blew up and I couldn’t get out and nobody outside could help me. Although now I can go to the bathroom fine now i still have that fear of getting stuck in a situation. My fear of going somewhere and not being able to come back from where I am is when i was about 8 i again went on a trip with my family to California. On the way there was fine but on the way back was a complete disaster. We had a layover in St louis and my parents couldn’t get me on the plane since i was freaking out so much. So my dad drove me back home on the east coast. The entire time I was so scared that I didn’t eat. For this trip I realize it’s not really that far away i just am terrified and don’t know if i can do it. I don’t know why we keep planning things like this when I know that I can’t handle it like i am dealing with anxiety so badly recently that I think it’s taking a toll on my body that my body just won’t be able to handle it anymore

I lapsed back onto alcohol thanks to a panic attack and I was on the verge of taking a Xanax for the first time when I decided I would make a drastic change instead. I began eating nothing but beef, salt and water. That’s it. 6 days in and my brain is beginning to feel like it’s never felt before!

I got all of the recommended vaccinations and a prescription for the medication. I learned the dance by heart and even had special clothes made for the event. However, due to anxiety about COVID and the side effects of the medication I would need to take—not to mention the fact that I'm traveling alone—I think I'm going to have to back out. 

This is a champagne problem, I know, but it's breaking my heart that I won't get to be with this person on their wedding day because I can't get over my fear. Life is so short and the older I get the more important it is to me to show up for the people I love as much as possible, and I'm failing at that.

193ka49,Anxiety,2024-01-10,TW: Ear infection spreading fears,"Female 23 years old

So for a few weeks i had this clogged feeling in my ear after using a qtip. During the holidays my ear starting hurting so i went to my GP. He said my ear canal was red and inflamed. He prescribed me some antibiotic eardrops. After using it for 4 days (i had to use them for 5 days) i started having ringing in my ear that was constant and panicked so i read that it could be a side effect of the antibiotics and to stop immediately. It was a sunday so i couldn’t call my GP for advice so i stopped taking them. The following day (monday) i immediately went back to my GP. He checked my ear again and said i had fluid in my ear and that is why the ringing is happening. He told me to just take painkillers for now and that my ear infection will pass.

Since tuesday evening i have been experiencing tension/pressure headaches an a painful stiff neck that is not going away. I called my GP again to ask for advice and he told me to keep taking the painkillers and if i’m still experiencing pain in the morning to come in and he is gonna prescribe me antibiotics. I obviously have been googling bc this is giving me anxiety and it said that ear infections can spread and cause mastoiditis and menginitis and i’m freaking out right now because a stiff neck and pressure in head are classic menginitis symptoms. I also read that ear infections cause these headaches and neck pain so idk my mind is going to worst case scenario. I also been experiencing a cold with a sore throat and a blocked nose. I’m scared that because i wasn’t given antibiotics sooner it spread. 

So really scared right now"
193jq09,Anxiety,2024-01-10,Derealization and depersonalisation aimed at another person rather than myself,"Hi

I have been recently experiencing a strange phenomenon that I can't find a name for, or description or acknowledgment of anywhere. 

Wondering if anyone can relate or knows about the name of it?

Over the past couple of years I've become emotionally estranged from my parents. I realised that I had an emotionally neglectful childhood, and spending time with my parents has now become a severe trigger for what might be some traumatic feelings (haven't seen anyone about this yet, but I think that might be what is happening)...

One particular feeling is a sense of Depersonalisation and Derealisation aimed at them only. To explain, with DR and DP normally I feel myself as unreal, however when I am triggered by them, I feel like they are unreal while I feel completely grounded otherwise. 

The most freaky part is feel like they are not parents in these moments, like we have no relation. Like THEY are strangers or even not really there. I just feel numb towards them.  Panic arises aimed at them rather than internally towards myself. Within myself I don't feel unreal or anything."
193hayo,Anxiety,2024-01-10,Anxiety Flare Up,"I am an 18m, and 31 days ago I got blackout drunk with a couple friends. The next few days I had a terrible hangover and terrible anxiety with it. A little context, I was diagnosed with panic disorder and anxiety disorder 6 years ago when I was in middle school. Back then I had panic attacks but got on 60mg (then down to 40) of Prozac and have been great since. Rarely had panic attacks, they were mild when I had them. Anyways, ever since I had the drinking incident I have had the worst anxiety of my life. Can’t sleep, can’t eat right, daily panic attacks (usually multiple). Note that I did get lazy about my medication in the weeks leading to this incident. I was basically only taking it like twice a week. 3 weeks ago I went to my doctor and he prescribed me 60mg of Prozac and 25mg of hydroxyzine when needed. I have consistently been taking my medication for those 3 weeks but it isn’t seeming to get better. Basically what I am asking, will it get better? Will I go back to the way I was before? I’ve lost my job, and am doing poor in college from all this. I’m not sure what’s gotten into me but any help I’d appreciate."

I’ve tried meds they make me crazy and even worse. No one will prescribe me sedatives even though it’s the only thing that works. They gave me propranolol and my blood pressure still doesn’t drop.

As you can read from the title my entire life has literally been a living hell with this intense form of anxiety that I have. I’m only 19 and my psychiatrist said that I have the worst form she’s seen in a while in a young person. So I feel hopeless. I’m currently on my first day of Effexor and I’m taking propranolol but I just feel like this isn’t going to help me as much as I need it to. I get heat flashes, sweats, my whole body shakes, racing thoughts, and panic attacks almost every single day. From the second I wake up, until the entire night, and I never get enough sleep, maybe 5 hours at most and then I’m jolted awake by my anxiety again. I have a highly addictive personality so I can’t go on Xanax. I literally got addicted to weed for 2 years straight, smoking out of a gravity bong and going through 20 bowls a day from the moment I was awake, til I fell asleep. I also am dealing with a bunch of diagnoses such as OCD, BPD, Tourette’s and CPTSD, so I’m greatly fucked in every way. My BPD makes me think such horrible and hateful thoughts about the people I love, my OCD makes me obsess and confess every thought, including the intrusive ones, and my Tourette’s get worse with these thoughts. And on top of that my hypochondria makes me almost faint every time I have pain somewhere. It’s currently 5 am and I still can’t sleep, so life has been hell lately. I also can never eat from this anxiety. Sorry for the rant, I just don’t know what the hell to do now. I’ve tried distractions, I’ve tried telling people my thoughts, I’ve tried journaling for years, my therapist is exhausted from me constantly messaging her, and my boyfriend is hurt by my horrible thoughts. My friends are tired of me too, and I just want to be numb forever, I don’t care if I feel happiness, I just want to stop my brain.

Over the last couple weeks it feels like my anxiety is getting to be unmanageable. I believe the main source of my anxiety and stress has come from the holiday season, but I know that I have a problem with ruminating on my anxiety which in turn makes it worse. My anxiety and gut also have a very strong connection. 

This is all to say - some mornings I feel so physically sick from my anxiety that it ruins the whole course of the day for me. I will spend hours curled up in my room with a trash can on standby in case I do vomit - which has happened multiple times. I can't keep living my life like this, it gets especially worse when I know I have some form of upcoming event. I fear I'll never be able to work a day shift job with my anxiety and gut in the condition they are. When I get anxious like this I try to keep myself distracted in some way, usually watching videos or a show to try and keep my mind busy. I also try to practice mindful breathing and thinking, but these only work to an extent. Does anyone have any advice or tips on how to try to keep my anxiety sickness away?

All in all I stressed a lot in the past years and I noticed that I feel not present a lot of the time when Im stressed even a bit, I am a gamer, or atleast I was, back then I was always the best player in the friend group, or I was the best in class I was a smart kid, but now if I sit down to play with friends I get anxious and I feel like my eyes literally cant focus on the monitor, my response time is not there, I feel like I cant perform like I did before in anything, sometimes I can, when Im not thinking about it too much but for 99% of the time even if I think about playing and not performing well makes me feel zoned out, like my mind wants to separate me from the thing that makes me stressed, and It ruins me, even if I go to my grandma with family to play card games together like we did for the past 6 years I get sleepy and my eyes get „blurry”, I dont know what to do but this ruins any time I spend with my friends or with my family, I cant imagine how do I look like for them sometimes, like a zombie, cant speak properly, cant focus, cant think.
Nowadays I feel okay with my life I mean, I have problems but I feel like I would be okay, if this eye focus thing wouldnt come as soon as I get stressed over something, I have better days but that makes me have no personality

I'm sharing, as this is the first time I haven't been overwhelmed by fear but have a part of me which is observing whats happening.  

I've had some realisations recently regarding my anxiety / low self esteem.  Its like i have this observer in day to day life (i've done some metta meditation / mindfulness / massage which could've initiated it). 

I realise how much my anxiety / low self esteem - don't they co-exist? - have become the the main way i see, relate to myself, others and the world.  My identity. 

I think its combination of massage / meditation and commitment.  My plan is to start swimming and weekly massages for 3 months - there is scientific evidence they help.

I lived in the central city where all my friends live and there’s a lot of nice restaurants and events. A year ago I wanted peace and quiet, wanted easy access to nature fron my home so I moved to the edge of the city near a national park. But now I never go there because I always have to go alone, now it feels like I would rather live in the city and maybe make a once in a while trip to the national park with a group of friends. It just feels like I have made my life very lonely since it takes me 1 hour to go see my friends and no one wants to come here for that reason. What’s wrong with me??

This was just an example but it has made me feel like I can’t trust myself because when I look at the previous decisions that I have done I can’t understand why and it feels like someone else made them.

I live alone so I am always by myself and I just sit in the same chair dealing with my anxiety symptoms until it's time to go to bed. I do this because whenever I get up to do anything else or go anywhere, my anxiety flares up and I get spaced out and dissociate etc and it's hard and scary.   
My question is after a revelation this morning, shouldnt I push through the terrible feelings of anxiety and do things anyway? Even though I'ts scary and feels weird and my anxiety flares up really bad? Isnt this the way out? Being involved? Instead of waiting for new symptoms to analyze?

190pmwu,Anxiety,2024-01-07,I keep replaying scenarios in my head where someone is breaking into my apartment,"It's currently almost 5am. My sleep schedule has been a bit messed up (for reasons unrelated to anxiety) and I'm up feeling incredibly antsy and anxious. 

I've been on Lexapro for just over a year now. That aging, and learning to avoid certain triggers has helped a lot with the random anxiety I get. I often freak out when I'm alone or when it's dark. I slept with a night light until probably 2.5 years ago. I'd cry myself to sleep out of fear as a kid (now 21) despite the night lights. Stuff like that has subsided for the most part, but it comes back occasionally like now. 

Typically, my boyfriend is around (currently online) and just texting him is enough to calm me but he's working at the moment. So for the first time in a while I just have to deal with this paranoia on my own. 

Sometimes the scenarios are completely made up, and other times they're things I've seen in TV shows or something that I now fear will happen to me someday. I feel like even just getting out of bed and making sure my doors are locked is enough to result in my murder. To me, my bedroom is safe if the door is locked. As long as I'm quiet, move as little as possible, and the door is locked, I'm mostly okay. 

Except I now realize someone could be under my bed or in my closet. I recognize it's unlikely. I haven't left my apartment in around a week. I would know if someone entered. But the thought is just there. What if they've been there for months? That sort of thing. I think the only thing keeping me from completely panicking is the Lexapro."
190pkfq,Anxiety,2024-01-07,Got Dumped Today Because of My Anxiety :),"I'd been with my GF for around 3 months now-- great the entire time. On Jan 1st, I had a huge anxiety/panic attack that I had to go the ER. I have a history of Health Anxiety, but I'd been anxiety-free for nearly 3 years. Anyway, being home for the holidays and especially being around certain family members + caffeine and nicotine really did me in. I had to go the ER because I don't have medication and I couldn't calm down.

So, I was texting her while I was there and I couldn't respond every second because A) I was freaking out, and B) The hospital staff kept telling me to do certain things. GF had been texting me to ask if I was alright, and I was like ""eh, not really. I had a huge anxiety attack but I won't stress you with the details."" She said that it wouldn't stress her out and that she wants to know what's going on with me, so I decided to go into detail about what I was feeling and what happened. Lo and behold she says she wasn't prepared for all that, but we eventually switched topics and everything was fine.

Now we both got back in the same town and she came to my apartment and broke up with me. Said that it really stressed her out and that she can't be around someone who has anxiety because of her own that she's been overcoming. Said I was great, blah blah blah, but for her own mental health she can't support someone like that.

TLDR; Had a huge anxiety attack, told GF, she said she can't be the support I need for her own mental health, and broke up with me.

I get it, it's tough to be support someone and it's semi-fair, but I still think it's kind of sh\*tty to just leave at the *first* sign of someone needing help. I also strongly believe that the core of a relationship is built on care and trust in the other person and leaning on each other when they need to. Clearly I dodged a bullet, but it still sucks."

I started googling symptoms and read about heart attacks, dysautonomia etc. For the first time in my life I experienced sense of doom and cried in front of my partner saying I feel something is weird and I’m scared for the future.

Today I physically felt okay, went to the gym and decided to force myself to go restaurant to prove myself I could still do it. During the entire morning I could not stop thinking about my health and condition. I started feeling unwell in the mall and overall sad that I’m not the one I used to be. I felt hypersensitive an cold. Sat down in the restaurant, looked at the menu and felt I was not even able to eat. It was a strange feeling. I felt hopeless like my life is ruined if I cant even eat in a restaurant without experiencing symptoms. Felt overwhelmed and was about to run out of the restaurant but decided to endure it and forced myself to eat. After like 10 minutes it got better. I left the restaurant and felt much better after deciding I would be going home. Rest of the afternoon I felt normal. In a way I even felt relieved it happened (like nothing worse can happen) and felt calm afterwards.

This is terrifying as it’s overwhelming and cant be controlled. I feel my life will be destroyed by what I’m experiencing this past few days.

Past year I put significant amount of stress on my nervous system and feel I’m now getting the consequences of that.  In December I took cold showers everyday until I stoped few days before the first recent attack. I’m also currently trying to reduce my cheap dopamine consumption (po*n).

Could I be experiencing a dopamine crash? Could this be temporary? I’m scared to develop long term panic disorder and anxiety. Are GAD and panic disorder linked?"

190p68n,Anxiety,2024-01-07,Heavy anxiety over recent world events,"——————TW: mentions of war———————-



I’ve always struggled with anxiety around world events but it’s gotten so much worse over the past month. Between some recent escalation in multiple wars around the world I can’t help but feel a sense that something big is going to happen in the next few years. As much as I try to think rationally and tell myself that everything is okay I can’t fully get rid of this feeling. Researching the actual probability of something like a world war happening any time soon has helped calm my anxiety but I feel like it’s only a matter of time before it gets worse. I’ve tried limiting my social media use to avoid fear mongering  but I can’t get rid of the overwhelming sense of dread. I guess I’m on here looking for reassurance that everything is going to be okay or at least ways to keep myself calm in the short term. Is there actually any reason to worry or am I thinking too much into things?"
190p5di,Anxiety,2024-01-07,Calling out of work &amp; worrying about being fired,"I'm 18, I work at McDonald's and I've been working for about 7 months now.

Last Sunday I had to call out due to food poisoning, I was vomiting and couldn't work. I did so 3 hours before my shift.

Unfortunately this week I stubbed my toe and it broke, and I've been reading that putting too much strain on it (walking, which a lot of my job requires) can cause it to heal wrong. I have a noticable limp and my work shoes make it extremely painful to walk. I'm thinking of calling out today, but I'm worried that I may be fired.

I have 95% attendance and before last Sunday I hadn't called out in a month and a half, but I do have the occasional issue at work that I go home for (panic disorder, panic &amp; anxiety attacks). I'm worried my other managers may think I'm abusing the system.

I could go to work if I really pushed myself to, but I'm worried it might be bad for the toe. I run orders out frequently and it's a lot of strain. I need help, am I going to be fired?"

She does have many of the symptoms but she claims she feels movement, it is also needed to say that she took every test a month and a half after sex, and she took another blood test(cuantitative) yesterday, she would be about 4 months and it came out negative. She also got three of the blood tests done in different labs because she says she is scared of human error.

About two months ago, I had a panic attack on a bus because I experienced many of these palpitations in succession, almost like my heart was stuttering for about 10 seconds or so.

190n1y1,Anxiety,2024-01-07,Struggling with anxiety returning home from college.,"Hey guys, first reddit post. I have been struggling with severe panic attacks daily while I was home for college and would get them often right when I was in bed ready to fall asleep. Where I experience panic attacks where it feels like a heart attack as I get the tightening in the chest, hyperventilation, etc. The only thing that would calm me down was my mom playing with my hair and rubbing my arm and hand. My anxiety has increased recently horribly rapidly ever since I graduated high school. (May 2023) As during that Summer I was suffering from recent diagnosed POTS chronic illness and still am which triggers a lot of the anxiety I feel. After experiencing some of that wild medical journey I have been having a lot of medical anxiety. I also had gone through so many things over that Summer; an ER visit, losing friends, a bunch of shit that happened my second semester of high school suddenly hitting me, my parents moving away from my town to a new state, and me going to college out of state. I think it’s pretty valid for me to have a lot built up feelings and anxiety about what’s happened and sadly I basically had to leave my therapist due to her out of state rules and such. This is basically a big bulk of context but I started feeling better when I was busy due to my workload in college for my first quarter where I was hanging with new friends and enjoying new things until I had to return home for college in my parents new home. I then had way more flare ups with my chronic illness and way more panic attacks multiple times day. It affects me so much when I need to sleep and it makes me so exhausted miserable. Now I’m returning to college and I noticed that I’m just not feeling like the person I was. I feel so defeated and exhausted. My anxiety has been rough and it’s almost 2:00am due to my panic feelings I get all the time. I am terrified that I won’t be able to make through my second quarter of college. I have talked to my mom about it and she also witnesses it but I think I need to be more serious and think of a plan to get the help I need. (Apologies for typos)"

190mwod,Anxiety,2024-01-07,I (21FM) started smoking weed at 14. I am now 21 and terrified to smoke again…but I want to try.,"So around the age of 14 I started smoking I had and still have several anxiety and depression, so I figured weed could help me. It made me really calm and tired overall just relaxed me and let me enjoy life a bit more.  It definitely helped my anxiety ALOT. When I was 16, me and my boyfriend broke up and I moved away where I met up with my amazing friend and he smoked to so we always smoked together and eventually started dating. But Fast forward to 18 years old, I was even more depressed and I had tried to commit suicide and I was smoking every chance I got. I just needed something to numb me and that’s what I counted on. I had started smoking delta 8 carts religiously maybe 7 carts a month.  It was bad and if I didn’t have my carts I’d become violent and I had outbursts and got into a lot of fights. I was high almost 24/7. I’d get high before I went to bed. I’d wake up at 4 in the morning to get high again, then I’d fall back asleep and immediately smoke when I woke up and continued throughout the day.
At 19 I got pregnant and I was still smoking up to 7 week pregnant. I was told to stop for the safety of my child. So I did. 
After I had my son it was about 2 months later I tried smoking again and it made my heart race again I became very agitated and jittery. I was so confused on why because I went years and years smoking and being completely fine to having severe panic attack whenever I smoked now. 
I’m really confused on why I can’t smoke anymore, I really want to start again, but it gives me the worse anxiety on top of the anxiety I already have. I wanna smoke again cuz everyone I know smokes and a lot of people tell me to try it again or whatever. And I’m out of options for medications due to severe side effects of them. 

The last time I smoked was recent and I still had the same reaction unfortunately.  Idk what changed. 

Has anyone else experienced this at all before? Smoking for years constantly. To having panic attacks whenever you smoke in present time??? Please tell me I’m not alone here."

 For example:

I never worried about my dog going outside to play, but suddenly I am hyper anxious when he’s outside even though I am watching him.

It’s been months now and I still can’t find a new one, I’ve only heard back from 1 or 2 out of the many places I’ve applied (had one actual interview, they hired someone else). I feel awful about wasting time. The thing is, I don’t need money right now to sustain my life style. I live with my parents, take care of them instead of paying rent, and I don’t have any depts to work for. But still, I feel the time slipping away, I feel I should be doing more important things, I put myself down for not doing as much as others are.

I’ve always set my standards high. But this time, they feel justified. I’m not doing anything at all and it causes me constant anxiety.

Because of that I miss out a lot with family and friends whenever anyone talks about a certain show or book.

The same happens with me on some adventurous stuff. People seem to love them but I cannot stand it. Travelling too gives me anxiety.

All these things make me feel like I'm a boring person. I love being in my home doing relaxing things but when I see everyone doing all these things I feel left out.

So recently it’s started setting in that I’m about to start university on this coming  Monday. I find myself stressing more and more about Monday the closer I get to it. The last couple of nights I’ve found myself staying up really late into the night trying to stretch the day out and have as much fun as I can before Monday comes. It’s hard for me to explain but basically I’ve been staying up as late as 3 or even 5 in the morning watching YouTube, TikTok or whatever else I like. I’m trying so hard not to fall asleep at night because I know that when I wake up I’m one day closer to Monday and I’m trying to avoid it at all costs.

190ljpr,Anxiety,2024-01-07,I was in denial of my GAD diagnosis because of how normal it was for me to feel anxious,"For context i had a rough childhood and ended up very mentally ill by the end of high school. When i turned 18 i decided to seek treatment for my depression alone, so i was very confused as to why my psych diagnosed me with general anxiety disorder (GAD).

It actually frustrated me and i was fully convinced that it was a misdiagnosis. When i was referred to therapists i'd tell them the same thing, but it wasn't until years later in my early 20s that i properly got treated for anxiety. It also wasn't until now that i remembered my GAD diagnosis and realised i'd been suffering from crippling anxiety for years without me even knowing because being constantly on edge was just that normal for me.

I guess this is just the reality for kids who grow up in traumatic environments. We reach adulthood still in that loop of constant fear but we literally don't know any different, ending up unknowingly navigating the world through a very twisted lens until we stop functioning and reach our breaking points as adults.

Here i am at 23 and it took me that long to really start treating my anxiety properly and understanding just how crushing and detrimental it has been in all aspects of my life. Now i can heal."

190l9ce,Anxiety,2024-01-07,chronic anxiety/panic,"(21,F) it started november 26th. i have chronic migraines already, so it started with head stuff. i've had a sleep eeg that came back clear, and i have an mri (to check for chiari malformation, which is hereditary and my mother has it) on tuesday morning. 

my panic attacks are everyday, if not every other day.. thursday i had one on and off for 16 hours. i went to the er 7 times in early december to get it treated because they didn't trust me with the ativan at home. i'm constantly in this mode and its started to affect me physically. i'm always nauseous, having migraines, i'm experiencing bad derealization, i just feel super ludic, my eyesight is always foggy and strained, i've been hiding out in my bedroom since early dec now, i'm throwing up from time to time, some days i can't even eat or drink liquids, i'm always tired, i sleep for hours and still feel the need to sleep, i have bad hot flashes and chills, my hands and feet go numb a lot, and my thoughts just keep getting worse. my panic attacks started out of nowhere and they always happen with no reason, which is what scares me the most.

my doctor has been working on getting me to a therapist, but we have to fight to even try to get them to try and take me. they tell me constantly i have no referrals, even though my doctor said she made a referral. 

lately it's gotten so bad to the point where i have somehow convinced myself i'm slowly dying (i know we're all technically slowly dying on the daily, but i mean that i'm convinced i only have a few weeks to only months left) or i'm possessed (again, another silly thought.. i know, but i can't help it in this state). all i can say is i'm sick of this and i don't know what else to do. i want to be able to get out of bed and not feel like the world isn't real/feeling like my life is real, i want to be able to see my surroundings clearly again, and i don't want to feel so hopeless. i just need reassurance it feels like. :/"
190l4xt,Anxiety,2024-01-07,This didn’t work for me,"When it comes to health anxiety, people  say “this didn’t work for me, or …,maybe that worked for you, but not for me. That method is outdated.”

 What didn’t work?  What method? What are we talking about? If you firmly believed standing on your head worked, it would work. Yes, you are going to find your own way, but this all basically boils down to changing how you view this and not fighting it. A nurse once confessed to me that she lied to patients who came to the ER with panic attacks and told them  that they had put meds in their IV that would quickly regulate their heartbeat. Not legal. They believed it and it worked.  I have yet to find anyone who actually overcame this condition who disagrees with the basic principle that this is more about not worrying and ruminating about it and not seeing it as a threat. And yes you will still get symptoms for a while with or without anxiety . AND NO IT’S NOT EASY AND I DON’T MINIMIZE IT. I don’t sugar coat it either. Sometimes it gets to you and there’s not a damn thing you can do about it, but you chip away by celebrating your minor victories. You dust yourself off and put it behind you to the best of your abilities and move on . You’re not doing anything wrong if you still get symptoms despite doing everything right.  Don’t let that add to your anxiety. Be patient,keep positive. Be kind to yourself . 

The people I have known who overcame health anxiety don’t talk about what meds to take (for me, if you need them to get by, so be it)—-they don’t talk about warm baths, avoiding coffee, going for a walk, vagus nerve, resolving old conflicts and forgiving those who hurt us—-I’m not knocking these, they help!—- but the focus of people who overcame this—-except for differences in minor points among them ——is always more about how they changed their perspective. A few online gurus are too cold turkey for me. No crutches to feel better as far as they’re concerned. You need crutches or training wheels, bandaids at first.  I discovered quite a few of them. It’s just not humane or realistic to me not to use things to distract or calm yourself down. I had to learn how to trick my mind. 

Only those who haven’t had health anxiety or haven’t recovered from say otherwise about this being about beliefs and perspective. Of course these people know better. What do I know. And yes there are exceptions. I’ve talked to a couple of women with serious emotional trauma where that was more of a factor. Always consult with a professional. I have a close friend who I only recently found out has schizophrenia. Except in some cases where there is a serious medical, psychiatric trauma involved, health anxiety in 97% of cases is usually caused by what you perceive—-your beliefs and self talk… a trigger. Over time this suggestion of danger becomes  an automatic response for your body , a false alarm. It’s up to you to gradually give it less importance and validity. You are going to find your own way, your own self talk to change your beliefs and perspective and your body will respond well. This isn’t so
much about doing anything as it is about leaving this alone, as difficult as this is. People feel they need to do something or that they are not doing something right. This is about getting out of the way and letting your body wind itself down. It’s a self regulating system. The more you try to control it, the more you agitate it. You are way more powerful than you realize.., if you learn to let go . After you kick this you will be better at dealing with adversity  than you ever were before."

The moment I sit all by myself I feel so anxious especially when I have to listen see my father. After that violent encounter I don't want to anywhere near him. I always keep my doors closed. Recently he has started talking about me to my mom. Just the usual stuff like whether I am eating or sleeping. Like nothing happened. This cycle of trama has repeated multiple times and it was my mistake to think that I can break it. I am done. I cannot fix him. It's not my responsibility. I moved back home with one goal and I need to do that. But sometimes these bouts of anxiety hurts. The pain, the trauma. It physically hurts. How do you live with man who is so traumatic. How does my mother do it everyday? She doesn't deserve this. I don't deserve this. But still here we are. Why is it that it is the people who has to deal with it has to do something about it? It's me who has to figure out a way out of this shit hole not him and clearly he is responsible for what I am going through. But I have to make myself okay. Take therapy, ignore, and whatever not him. That fucker is living his life. His patriarchal disgusting life. I hope he regrets. I want him to suffer. He should know that people don't love him. His children don't love him. His wife only does all of the wifely duties because of the society. Not by choice. I hate him. I hate him. I hate him. I hate him. I hate him."

I've been stressed about like. Time, death, ect. But like im really young. I've had thoughts like this before but they're usually short lasted and then i move on with my life. 
Instead i've been overwhelmed with anxiety for about two weeks now, and it's no longer the type of anxiety im used to feeling. I can't do anything. I didn't go to school because i couldn't handle it. I still don't know if i can. I don't even know exactly what the issue is anymore, i can't even pinpoint exactly my problem.

190kw89,Anxiety,2024-01-07,My health anxiety is getting really bad,"Last February, I got an abnormal pap smear (LSIL) and a positive HPV test. I had to get a colposcopy and it came back with both CIN 1 and CIN 2 cells. I have to get another colposcopy in a couple of weeks to determine if I need additional treatment. 

Ever since that diagnosis, my health anxiety has been on overdrive. It’s like every week I get anxiety that I have either ovarian cancer, brain aneurysm, HIV, thyroid, etc. My biggest fear is getting sick with something with barely any symptoms, like the abnormal pap smear, and not knowing until its too late. Tonight, my anxiety is towards my partner having melanoma all because I read a reddit comment that said “go get your moles checked out”. 

Logically, I know the risk of any of these things are low. But its the fact that its not impossible that makes me so anxious. And its like no matter how much I try to not think about it, I can’t help myself from obsessing over it and googling which then further increases my anxiety. It’s like a cycle that keeps me continuously anxious.  

How do I keep myself from obsessing over my health? Any tips to help me ground myself before I send myself into overdrive like tonight?"
190kw7d,Anxiety,2024-01-07,Propranolol,"I recently got prescribed 10mg Propranolol to take as needed, because I get lots of physical symptoms of anxiety such as flushing, voice shakes, shortness of breath, etc. This has been interfering with my job hunt as I’ve bombed every interview I’ve had no matter how prepared I was - my face goes beet red, I feel like I’m choking and my voice shakes in practically every interview I’ve had. 

My blood pressure is already pretty normal, it ranges from 114/84 to 119/85 with my heart being around 75. I started off with 5mg, felt nothing, so I took 10mg for the past 2 days while at work. I currently work in retail and my anxiety will just make my face go beet red for no reason - although with the 10mg I did feel a lot calmer and didn’t feel as jittery as I always do! I thought it was actually working, but then pretty much as soon as it hit the 4-5 hour mark after taking it, I think it wore off and I noticed my physical symptoms coming back. 

Looking back on it I honestly can’t even tell if it even worked in the first place or if it was the placebo effect. My questions are

1. Does 10mg really even do much in your experiences? 
2. When I first took 10mg, my blood pressure went from the usual 114/85 to 109/78. Would upping the dosage to 20mg make it drop way too much? I didn’t feel lightheaded at all so that’s a plus… 
3. Would taking a higher dosage make it last longer?
4. For those of you who take it, since the effects usually wear off after 4-5 hours, do you take another pill then? Or would something like extended release be better? 

I realize the best way to figure this out is to actually take the 20mg and just see what happens, but this is just me obsessing and stressing over it before I actually take that step lol."
190k9iq,Anxiety,2024-01-07,Risk of premature beats on Smart Watch,"I actually had an ECG already prior to this, doc said everything is fine. I have health anxiety so chest pain is not new to me but this is causing me so much stress, makes me want to throw my watch.

Does anyone here getting some heartbeat problems on smart watch I have Huawei watch and it has about 90% accuracy tracking my heart rate so this is causing me stress and anxiety and I wanna get checked out again as I am freaking out watching this alerts yesterday. I just did an afternoon easy 3k run then at night I feel like having mild anxiety attack(I do experience anxiety attack occasionally) that caused bit of shortness of breath and me panicking I did a heart monitor on my watch and this came out.

Arrhythmia detected, Risk of Premature beats - I got this alert 3x in 2 hour monitoring.

Says it’s common for stressed or exhausted person but it just alarms me. Is ECG enough in hospitals to check if you have heart issue? Any recommendations too? I would appreciate it. Thank you"
190k9cx,Anxiety,2024-01-07,Obsessive anxiety about limb placement and fear of pain,"Hi everyone,I've been lurking  on reddit a long time but I've never made a post. I'm 27,I've had ocd for a very long time,well over a decade. While I've always been able to engage with therapy and deal with it fairly well in recent years,in the last 6 months or so ive had a ramping up ocd theme that feels like it's getting worst.

Around 6 months ago I pulled a muscle closing an open door; fair enough,done that a dozen time at the gym over the years but for some reason this began to lead to a very odd obsession over my limb position,mostly my arms, over fear of injuring them. It's literally all I can think about now,I'm incredibly overobserving of where my arms are,how I pick things up,grab things etc as a result I've hurt my back and shoulders numerous times, and almost in constant pain.it feels like I've been permanently injured for months,although a ultrasound of my shoulders doesn't show any concerning damage. 

It feels like I've literally forgotten somehow wheres a natural position to put my arms (like sitting down on the sofa,lying in bed etc) it's infuriating and really upsetting,since it's been too painful to actually exercise since it started. I've been unable to find any similar stories or literature, and I don't seem to be able to put into effect my usual techniques to dealing with ocd with whatever this is. 

I'm scared of causing chronic pain issues and never dealing with it; I can't even use my medical weed anymore since it seems to get worst doing that now. I'm really at my witts end,have I really forgotten how to move properly? Any advice or thoughts welcome,thank you!"

I have no issue driving if I have someone else in the car with me, because of that blanket of knowing someone else could take over if I got trapped and nowhere to go spiraling.

I have had heart worries on and off sporadically through the years. But the last 2 years have been horrendous.

I was tested in June 2022. I had an ecg, zio patch for 14 days and an echocardiogram other than my usual PVCs and a slight heart murmur the cardio gave me a clean bill of health.

But…… since then I have been stuck in a severe anxiety phase of thinking I am going to have a heart attack and die. I have centre chest pain that feels sometimes stabbing other times like a slight achy heavy feeling. My heart rate walking about hits 30 bpm. After a meal it can hit 120 walking about after. I am having panic attacks every week and they hit 170.

I am constantly checking my pulse I have an Apple Watch and a pulse ox. I check my bp daily it can range from 110/60 to 154/74. 

I am constantly holding my breathe and tensing which has caused so many stomach issues but I think it also contributes to my chest pain. I get so anxious when anyone visits or if I have to go out.

I am just scared, can anyone relate at all."

1908inw,Anxiety,2024-01-06,I have PTSD but never tell anyone as it seems silly why I have it,"When ever I hear PTSD I think of a veteran or a sexual assault survivor, really anything other then what happened to me. I inadvertently got a dog killed.

Contexts: 
1. I am a huge animal lover, I take care of a feral colony of cats that have all been fixed, and I really want to go in the rescue field at some point even if it’s just volunteering an hour a week. But I don’t think I can know because of this (I feel like I’m stalling)

2. I went to a really small town, there were only about 45 kids in my grade, I knew about 2/3 of them from all the way from kindergarten. It was also extremely racist and close minded town which was hard enough cause I’m lesbian, I heard the n word at least once a week, but that’s a different can of worms.

3. I was working two jobs both small hours one of them was at a pumpkin patch. I would pick pumpkins and help with customers. The other job was a cashier at a local pharmacy.

4. I already have anxiety, depression and panic attacks happen about once a month. At the time I was doing okay, i laid in bed most of my free time and was taking medication, I also pick up my skin and have trichophagia(I pull and eat my own hair) 

5. I was 17 when this happened 

On this day I was supposed to be picking pumpkins at a patch I have only went to once and it was my first time going there alone, I missed my turn. I told myself I was just going to turn around in the next driveway or road. The first of the two was a driveway of someone I sort of knew because of school, I was just starting my senior year at the time of this. So I pulled in and there two dogs ran up to me and started barking at the sides of my car. I waited probably just 2 or 3 seconds before I started pulling back out, they were both in front of my car at this point. I get out to the end of the driveway and see I can go, I pull all they way out, the dogs were going back to the house but still alert. With me in the road I see another car coming, I didn’t see it because I was backing up. I looked to my side to see the two dogs starring at me because I had to change gears. One of them didn’t like that and started running at my car (there driveway is about 50 feet long) I didn’t know what to do so I started honking to try and warn the other car but as the dog ran in the road the car passed. 

I jumped out of my car and saw the dog crawling back towards the house with half of her body limp. I ran as fast as I could up to the house and started knocking on the door and shouting. Eventually after like 15 or 20 seconds someone from behind a barn came out and said hello, same time the door opened and I just said your dog got hit by a car. Me and the two men ran out to the driveway where the poor dog was crawling, one of them picked her up and brought her into the backyard. Me and the other lady who was In the car that hit the dog just stood there wait for them to come back, but me and her talked a little bit. She said she didn’t see her and I said I was sorry as I felt it was my fault. 

They came out and said we could go so we both left. I went to work but left early because of what happened. I went home and told my mom everything and she said it wasn’t my fault but I’m the type of people to constantly say sorry and apologize for the littlest of things even if it wasn’t my fault so I felt guilty. I started constantly checking the family members Facebooks as I wanted to know if there was an update on the dog. On Sunday I was supposed to go volunteer for NHS and my mom woke me up and told me please don’t look at Facebook, I did. And they said that they had to put her down but from the interaction that we had they thought that I was the one that hit her. 

They thought I pulled and ran her over and pulled her out to the road. They said the next person the pulls in their driveway will get a rock through the window. I understand how they could misconstrued what I said, as they weren’t quite listening because they were mostly caring about their dog, but they knew it was me they could’ve contacted me. My mom did reach out to her though, and tried to explain the situation as I was a wreck. I didn’t listen, but I knew that they got into an argument. My mom is just asking her to take down the Facebook post and then she explained what happened. The lady on the phone though was adamant about what happened and my mom asked if she was there because I was. She eventually realized that maybe she should’ve posted and deleted it later in the week.

It was very hard for me after that as I still volunteered and told one of my friends that I was working with what happened but when Monday came around, I almost didn’t go to school. They never said my name in the Facebook post but their sons go to my school they’re only a grade below me and most classes have a mix of grades. I went anyway, and I was extremely anxious. I told my close friends what happened to and they were supporting me as they know the type of person that I am and that I would be much worse shape if I did hit the dog. 

I didn’t know this at the time, but on the first day, one of the brothers was telling some of my acquaintances what happened and the friend that I told on Saturday stood up for me and said that isn’t what happened. And asking those acquaintances later they also said that the story that he was describing doesn’t sound like me.

On Monday, though, I only was able to last half the day before I had a panic attack. It started getting so bad that I started hearing things walking to the cafeteria. They weren’t real, though it was my brain just running amok. The rest of the week was like that with me barely getting through days and having panic attacks constantly I was scared I was gonna lose everyone around me for some thing that I didn’t do. And because people were talking about me I started having a hard time trusting people. 

I know these all sound like extreme reactions. Like I said earlier, I’m not mentally sound, and this only made it worse. I’m a very honest person even when I’m in the wrong. And I have a hard time judging social interactions or cues. 

As the days went on, I would only ever be able to make about four of the five days of school for the rest of the school year. I couldn’t stand to be in the cafeteria anymore so I ate lunch at one of the teachers rooms. I became extremely depressed and ended up gaining a 100 pounds. My friends were still there for me though and so is everyone else because they knew the type of person I am. The woman who made the original Facebook post deleted it and then posting an update on what really happened but the post made it clear that she still didn’t believe me and saw it all as my fault.

One day at the pharmacy I was working the drive-through and the lady ended up pulling up. I just handed the phone to one of my coworkers and said you need to take this and I hid in the back room until she was gone. Luckily it was close to close so by the time I started to freak out, I was already in my car. 

Any time I saw her or her family I would just freeze up and try to get away as I knew I wouldn’t be able to control myself and would have a panic attack. It happened a couple more times I saw them out and about but by the end of the year. I was the heaviest and most depressed I’ve ever been. a lot of people didn’t believe the story that they were saying, and mostly believed me. It helped, but the damage is already been done to my mental state. however, I started to come to the conclusion that it wasn’t my fault. It especially wasn’t the dogs fault (it’s a dog), it wasn’t even the owners fault, it just happened. 

I graduated and started a weight loss medication that I was also diagnosed with an eating disorder. One day I hung out with one of my friends, and we went to a store that buys from Amazon warehouses and then resells them at low prices, and I found some thing really good so I bought it and I had too much of it so I thought I would try to sell it on Facebook marketplace. Because of this I had to download messenger which I’ve never had before and that’s when I saw that she messaged me about two or three weeks after the incident.

At this point, I was angry at her, I wanted to tell her how much she hurt me, ask her why she never believed me from the start, why would she make that post, why would you let your sons tell everyone that I purposefully kill your dog. I started trying to explain through messenger but I had a panic attack. I just got out of the shower and was only wearing underwear but I ended up crying so loud my mom heard and came up and comforted me for about 30 minutes until we were able to get a shirt on me, she said for me to not respond and to talk to my therapist first so I did and she said it was a great thing that I didn’t respond. I then got diagnosed with PTSD.

I still haven’t responded and I don’t think I ever will. I got out of the town in about a year ago, I’m 19 now and I live in Ann Arbor with one of my high school friends. as a matter fact, my whole group still is very close and they come down whenever they can and we hang out with each other. I still have a hard time trusting if they believe what I say, or if they even like being around me, but they still are here so I have my answer for that. 

I don’t think I’ll ever fully heal from this. Even though it would be something minor to someone else, I’m not mentally strong I need reassurance. 

Also, if you read this far, thank you this post took me a couple months to write as I would become mentally distressed when thinking about it, but the situation upsets me and I don’t think I’ll ever get over it as even here I panic about certain things. Like how dogs make me uncomfortable I can’t turn around in peoples driveways or death of a pet it’s hard for me to talk about. And considering how I wanted to work with animals and in the rescue field I feel like I can’t do it anymore as I’m scared that people think I purposefully killed an animal when I was trying to help it. I feels like she took that from me but I’m still gonna try even if it’s hard and my brain panics I still want to help animals. 

Again, thank you and if you don’t read all of us that’s totally fine. I understand this is a shit ton I just needed to tell anyone and vent"
190j0ps,Anxiety,2024-01-07,severe panic disorder + heart scare + agoraphobia + losing everyone I loved = hell,"Hey there. 39/M. Thanks for reading. Been fighting panic disorder and depression for 14 years. Have a therapist and psych, in the process of coming off Lexapro for Remeron. 

3 months ago went to ER for a possible arrythmia. Never been more scared in my life, was stuck underground the nyc subway my heart was skipping beats and wouldnt stop. Like a fish in my chest the rhythm was chaotic. 15 min for EMTs. As someone who has phobia around his heart and is terrified of skipped beats, this is my worst nightmare. I was hyperventilating, shaking, and terrified. I called my gf to say goodbye. After staying overnight, the only thing abnormal was troponin levels, were 57 ng/ml.  Stayed all night till they leveled off. 

They said it was from extreme panic/stress, my cardiologist agrees but slight possibility I did indeed have an arrythmia like afib or SVT, or just a few ectopic beats, and it set me off. Still ongoing testing but shes confident I'm ok and it's not fatal. EKGs, echos, holter, all ok. 

Im not confident at all. My anxiety has tripled. Ive always had heartphobia, but this broke me. I've developed agoraphobia now, and walking more than a couple blocks away from my house sets me off. I panic almost daily now. 

I should also mention since then I lost my job, my girlfriend and I broke up, my mother betrayed me, and my best friend bailed on me. I'm gonna be 40 soon, and feel like there's a midlife crisis on top of this. 

I'm getting help but have never felt more helpless. I'm doing the right things but never felt so wrong. I've never been so lost, alone, delirious, and horrified."
190j8zi,Anxiety,2024-01-07,Car anxiety as a parent,"I have insane anxiety involving cars that is becoming increasingly difficult to deal with as a mom that does not drive. 

I never learned to drive. My cousin died in a car accident when I was 16 - around the time I would be learning. My family delayed it and delayed it. Eventually I moved to a city. I still haven’t learned. 

At 18 I was in a yellow cab that was t boned by another cab. Thankfully I wasn’t seriously injured. I needed about 15 stitches but it was okay. 

Since then I have had bad anxiety whenever I am in a car. Constantly having my eyes on the road, worried about if something will happen etc. 

Fast forward to now I’m a toddler mom. My son and nanny were struck by a vehicle last year while they were walking in NYC. Thankfully both okay. 

A year later and he was just involved in another accident. A car missed a stop sign and struck our family car. Both cars badly damaged. The car struck exactly where my son was sitting. THANK GOD, everyone is okay. I know that is all that matters. 

But I’m still crying every night holding my child just worried of anything happening again. 

Something as simple as taking him to a class 5 minutes from our house is terrifying to me. 

Is this normal? I’m over thinking the whole thing. Like is it a sign? Do I need to change something about my life? 

Do I need to learn to drive?!!!!😅😭🥲

Maybe being in control would calm the anxiety? 

I’m literally ranting but if anyone has been in a similar situation or has anything helpful to share I would be so grateful."

I start my new job this week and while I’ve been incredibly excited and only a little nervous, now the nerves are really kicking into high gear. 

I am beginning a whole new career after being in a previous career for two decades, so I know it makes sense to be nervous.

I left my last job bc it was just so overwhelming and unsustainable. I knew I couldn’t stay there any longer, but I’m a creature of habit and stayed probably 4 years longer than j bc it was “comfortable” and it was “what I knew how to do”. 

As an anxiety sufferer, I hate change! Even though I KNOW this is the right decision for me, I can’t help but be completely freaked out.

Will I be trained bc this is all new?
Will I like it?
Will I regret leaving my other job?
Will they regret hiring me?

And of course, the “what ifs…”
What if I have stomach issues bc of anxiety?
What if I throw up?

Does anyone have any helpful tips? I’ve already got a check list for tomorrow and will have everything prepped the night before. Should I take my “emergency” Ativan that morning, just to calm myself (it’s a low dose)?"
190io2z,Anxiety,2024-01-07,Been given a second chance. Need urgent help please.,"25F with BPD, ASD, and PSTD.

I’m doing my masters and I’m 2.5 years in, this is my last semester. I passed all of my requirements and finished everything, however last semester I took a class outside of our department and ended up failing. I felt so hopeless. I know I didn’t study as hard as I did for all of my other classes, but the instructor wasn’t helping either. He told me I don’t deserve success or a masters degree, and that I was lowering the bar for other students just my being in the class.

I worked so hard to get to where I am and not go crazy in the process, his words really shook me. 

Luckily, my school recently instilled a new regulation whereby anyone who gets an F can repeat the class once and the old grade would be replaced.

This is the only class I’m taking and I’m 95% done with my thesis. I still have a lot of control over what happens, but I’m terrified. 

I can’t sleep, eat, or get out of bed and I feel unworthy. The semester’s a month away, I can’t imagine feeling like this for an entire month, possibly the entire semester. I’ve already lost so much weight and hair, I’m worried this is going to affect my academic progress, but every time I try to fight to get up, I feel nauseous and weak.

190igd9,Anxiety,2024-01-07,Friends calling me paranoid,"Hey everyone, just wanted to get some advice or start a discussion.

I have struggled with Anxiety disorder/panic disorder and agoraphobia for a while now and recently off topic to the conversation, one of my friends specifically said that I was paranoid (not in a mean or accusatory way but in a matter of fact kind of way). I know they weren't trying to be mean or reductive but it has been really bothering me.

That friend thought I was diagnosed with Paranoid personality disorder and when I googled the symptoms, it just really didn't resonate with my experience and a big difference it had from the disorders I actually am struggling with was that symptoms were rooted in delusion and had no basis in reality. I think something I am working on is a lack of affirmation of my fears and anxieties, both from myself and others when I share how I am feeling.

That is why hearing from that friend that they thought in some part, that my shared anxieties were based in delusion and lacked reality was really hard for me to hear, especially because I thought they were someone who could listen to me without judgement.

Does anyone else have any advice about navigating feeling like your anxieties are not being affirmed? I do think I am a logical person and that my anxieties I deal with are based in reality... albeit not warranting the degree to which they affect my life. It just feels sometimes that other people are calling me stupid or completely irrational for my fears and that just ends up making me ashamed of having them in the first place. Anyone relate or has advice?"

I get anxiety for a lot of things like going out and things outside of my comfort zone but mostly my health. Every single pain, twitch, spasm I spiral so hard it literally takes over me for hours, days and lately weeks. I stay on google and Reddit for hours googling all my symptoms and it just makes me spiral even more (I know I need to stop), it makes me feel like I’m not myself, like I’m scared, hopeless and helpless. Sometimes I can’t eat or sleep or do anything but stay in bed trying to distract myself. Sometimes I wake up in the middle of the night with palpitations or wake up with anxiety. Sometimes I can’t even talk. It makes me physically ill, I start feeling weird pains, I can feel my heartbeat everywhere my stomach always hurts sometimes I think I’m gonna throw up. I’ve tried different coping mechanism like teas, sucking on a lemon, cold water, praying to God, therapy, you name it. I never wanted to get on medications for side effects and because I wanna try and feel normal without being dependent on medications. But idk sometimes I feel like maybe I should.

I also have recovered from that too. 

Since pain from back had went away and leg pain I went back to the gym 
Day one was amazing 
Day two was also good 
Day was on the stair master and was walking and leg flaired up again and back and day after started getting weird tingling in the back of the head 

That progressed into weird and string tingling in the back of the head . I was getting super worried and it cause sharp headaches. It’s in the occipital area FORSURE I’ve done all the research and it was also down my shoulders and neck and even arms some times. I have to once again say that it’s not like pain it’s also not tingly how you would feel like pins and needles it’s just there idk . And it went away after a while but now it has flared up I guess and I’m tired of worrying . I don’t know what it could be. Pt said it’s cervical radiculopsthy but that’s in the neck. How can a pinched nerve go into the back of the head . I can only describe it like kinda sharp burning. Someone help me out. No way anxiety can cause all of that sensation but idk . Muscle compression idk either"

I know I need to relax but I’m I end up being stressed and anxious that I’m not doing enough even when there’a nothing for me to do.

190i3gf,Anxiety,2024-01-07,"I've been to the hospital two times now convinced I was sick, I'm pretty sure it was anxiety","Man I've never had that before. I feel like I'm turning crazy or losing my mind it's insane. One minute I'm fine and I can act and think rationally and the next I feel like I'm gonna drop from fatigue and like I can't think or function anymore AT ALL. Let alone talk. It feels like I have something in my brain turning it off it's so scary, I don't understand. I never knew anxiety could have this effect I thought I was having a brain tumor or something and went to the ER. The memories mesh together and I'm so confused. 

I'm absolutely terrified of death and the nothingness, absolutely convinced I'll die if I fall asleep and that I won't wake up, absolutely sure I have schozlphrenia, or cancer, or a stroke or something else it's driving me crazy I don't know what to do. Pretty sure I have some kind of health anxiety and I feel like this impending doom, like I'm certain I won't live old and I'm gonna die soon. I'm absolutely terrified all the time about my health and I've never had something like that before. 

I've been having actual symptoms of things that I obviously don't have since I've done the tests and they all come back clean, and I feel so ashamed of wasting people's time in the hospital. I can't believe anxiety can give such real symptoms, I don't know what to do or how to deal with this. Am I turning crazy?"

190hv73,Anxiety,2024-01-07,Claustrophobia resulting from GAD or social anxiety,"Hey sub,

Im curious - is there someone who developed claustrophobia (possibly in selective settings) out of their GAD or social anxiety, that they never had before?
What i started experiencing recently, after 2 years with social anxiety, is that i start getting panic attacks while (originally) on a crowded bus, plane, or specifically when the subway train stops inside the tunnel, and (now) with regular bus and subway rides. I feel like it stems from the idea of me not having an opportunity to leave the situation that triggers anxiety whenever I want (aka loss of control), so was curious if someone came up with a solution. 
P.S. whats interesting, is that this anxiety with situations that I cant physically leave developed only 2 years later.

Cheers!"

I know anxiety has triggers, but how often is it that the triggers need to be eliminated rather than be managed better? 

I ask this question bc of my situation with college. I had a rough semester with my anxiety. However I’m not sure if it’s because I was mentally and physically burnt out, or if being at my particular college is the problem. 

I hope this makes sense."

190grmg,Anxiety,2024-01-07,I'm paralyzed and don't want to put effort into anything,"I don't know what to do. I feel overwhelmed by any single prospect of having to put effort into something I don't want to do. I've been laying in bed on my phone all day. I haven't eaten anything all day because the thought of making food sounds like such a chore I would rather lay here and starve. But I still feel anxious and overwhelmed by just laying here because I known I'm wasting my whole day. I've just been flipping through apps every minute and googling random things to avoid something, I don't even know what I'm trying to avoid. I'm super frustrated. It's 7PM and I finally found the courage to pick up my journal, but I'm just writing in circles trying to figure out what I'm actually thinking or feeling. 

I know the solution is to just bite the bullet and make something to eat for now, but after that what do I do? I have nothing I want to do and thinking of putting effort into something I don't want to do makes me want to stay in bed for longer. And I'm trying to figure out how to fix this issue because I do this all the time and it's ruining my life, but any type of thinking or introspecting that takes actual effort feels like too much for me. I don't understand myself or my feelings, my mind is so fucking foggy all the time. I need somebody to come punch me in the face. But then I would continue to lay in bed and loathe myself for being too shitty to get up even after being punched in the face. 

It's so frustrating when I see my therapist because I can't even convey this to him. I tried telling him that I feel stuck and want to improve myself and don't know how and I hate myself for it and all he kept repeating was ""you will only change when the pain of being the same outweighs the pain of changing."" I don't know what to do with that, I feel guilty that I'm not improving myself at all and I'm constantly so stuck and it feels like he's expressing his frustration that I can't learn or apply a damn thing. And I basically am just waiting for the pain of hunger to force me out of bed but that's not a very efficient way of living life. 

This is such a shitty vent im sorry"

There have been some stressful situations going on in my life for a couple months and i know for a fact it’s contributing to my anxiety. 

I’ve been having weird pains in the middle/left side of my chest for like a week out of nowhere. Honestly, it’s not even really pain, just discomfort and occasionally it feels tingly. For a few days it was definitely acid reflux because I had really bad heartburn due to the stress, but I think that’s gone away now. I couldn’t help but think I was having a heart attack, and currently, I’m afraid of that again because I feel so tense and anxious. I don’t even know why. To make matters worse, I also have OCD and I can’t stop thinking about my chest no matter how hard I try. I had a really good couple days with my family and I didn’t think about it at all, so the feeling in my chest was completely gone. But now I just feel so bad and so drained. I feel so scared of everything for no reason and nothing is helping.

I’ve been in therapy many times but I’m not currently seeing my therapist for financial reasons. I’ve never been on any medication, but would it help me? Do I need to go back and see my therapist in order to see a psychiatrist? I don’t know. I just really need some help."
190goij,Anxiety,2024-01-07,How I got rid of my Anxiety Disorder,"I make it fast and simple.

I was afraid of everything since I was a child.
I was shy and had social anxiety.
As an adult, I was afraid to go outside, I was constantly nervous and anxious while walking outside. I had trouble sleeping and eating because I was always stressed and anxious.

What was the cause?

The main cause was simply the fear of other humans.

I was afraid of some sort of confrontation that could happen.

I was afraid of being attacked physically.
I was afraid of being attacked verbally.
I was afraid of being judged negatively
I was afraid of being criticised.
I was afraid that someone would make fun of me.

I was afraid because If someone did it, I couldn't defend myself.

I was weak.

And because of my weakness, people took advantage of it and actually treated me like shit.
I was constantly disrespected and humilated since my childhood.

When someone disrespected me, I couldn't defend myself, because I was a coward.

I was afraid of conflict and I was afraid of aggression and violence.

I was afraid of losing control and become
emotional.

I was a people pleaser and a pathetic coward.

I repressed everything. The repression and cowardice led to severe self esteem issues and an even stronger anxiety disorder. It was so severe I didn't even realized what the cause was, because I was 24/7 in a bad mood, anxious and stressed.

I just wanted to die.

It was so much pain that it actually forced me to finally defend myself.

What did I do?

I confronted the people who disrespected me.

I punched a coworker in the face.
I yelled at a coworker.
I talked calmy with a coworker.
I talked aggressively with a coworker.
I told my Boss to go fck himself.

I've had conflicts with varying intensities.

I told different people that they are assholes and they should go fck themselves. I even told it to my own mother.

I was afraid to death.
I was so much afraid of a confrontation, I just wanted to die.

I was shaking, I felt sick, I was almost crying while confronting them.

Do you know what happened after I done it?

I felt euphoric. The anxiety was gone. I could smile again, I could eat and sleep again, 
I could look in the mirror without feeling bad.
My self esteem was back.
People suddenly had respect for me.

All my life I was told that I have to be kind and friendly to others. I was told that violence is a no go. I was told to never escalate but deescalate.

I promised to myself I will never be a coward again. Even if it means death.

I solved the anxiety issues, but I can't overcome my mistrust for humans to this day. I think it's a task for one of you.

Good luck and best wishes."

This is a casual side job and there’s going to be someone else there working as well so I’m not leaving the person I’m working for stranded. However, I still feel anxious that I’m making a bad decision. It doesn’t help that I texted saying I’m not going to make it and got no response (which is usually what happens about 75% of the time and has never been a problem) I’ve never “called” out always “texted” out which she’s always been fine with. I texted the other girl working tomorrow to let her know as well just in case but I’m still an anxious mess. I feel like not going is the right decision especially because the person I work for has her elderly mom living in her house who shouldn’t be exposed to any illnesses. I still have that self doubt though and no matter how terrible I feel (which is REALLY terrible right now) I feel like I should just go to work.

It was a good night, everything went well and i went out for lunch with my friends that i went out with the night before.

Days after going out im sat thinking the night over and over again, I know i did nothing wrong but my mind won’t let me move on? It’s torture. 

I’ve had my issues in the past with drinking heavily and genuinely messing up which i’m well past now so i think i’m so used to having everyone hate me after.

Here's a scenario with a particular friend.

I ask him if he's available to hang a week in advance. He tells me 'I'll let you know.'. 3 days before my proposed date, he says ""Sorry, I can't confirm anything with you until I confirm something with my other friends that may or may not be happening at the same time."" So that immediately signals to me that I'm the backup friend. 1 day before the event, I get a message ""Hey, you free tonight instead? My other friend hasn't said anything."" I mean, I was free, but it felt a bit icky just suddenly changing plans like that like my time wasn't worth the same as this 'other friend'.

When we do meetup that day, he tells me a story about one of our mutuals, how the mutual wasn't doing well so he offered his house and a place to vent for the night. And I'm wondering, ""Would he do the same for me?"" I've definitely had some anxious breakdowns and communication style discussions with him before, about how he responds to the mutual much faster while I get left on delivered/read for a couple days or how he laughs/reacts to the mutuals messages in the group chat more often than my own messages. But all I get are assurances that this is how he treats all his friends.

So now I'm unsure where I stand with him. Am I just overthinking our interactions? On the grand priority scale of friends, am I just lesser than the mutual even though we all met at the same time? And lesser than the 'other friends' too? Are we even friends?"

There is millions of us who suffer daily from stupid thing called anxiety. 

Little back story from myself below 

So 2021 when i started getting anxiety and panic attacks due to my health anxiety i assume. Suffered from those long time and finally 2022 it started going better but i didnt know what made it go better. Year 2023
Started awful and it was back. But this time even worse.. living was so bad, i couldnt get up from my bed without feeling shit. 

I didnt visit doctor once because i believed i can find cure by myself. Tried everything from breathing tactics, no caffeine, good sleep, no stress and so on. I didnt wanna touch actual medicine because their shit. 

FINALLY after reading everysingle thing in internet i found out vitamin B12 and Folic acid (B9) deficiency could be reason why most of us suffer from anxiety, especially generalised anxiety. Just imagine. 

Went to buy both in same pill form, and guess what? 
Anxiety boom gone after 2 days of eating them. Like no joke. This is my 7th day without single feeling of anxiety. 
I have no words how i feel, like how it feels like to be normal without having thing behind your ear listening ur racing heart and just generally feeling awful. 

Obviously everyone is different and suffer from different reasons but please go and buy B12+B9 vitamin and give it an shot. Cost absolutly nothing.

190dhq4,Anxiety,2024-01-06,Always feel like I’m unsafe and somebody is out to get me / hurt my family,"I have to get this off my chest 

Due to negative past experiences, such as being severely stalked as a 17 year old, and followed around 

I have developed severe anxiety and it has never gone away 

I’m now 25 and I still have a constant fear in the back of my mind that people are out to get me 

I know I should discuss all this with a therapist but I honestly find them useless 

This is an example of some of my negative experiences that make me feel people are out to get me : 

I had a friend who I insulted, (his dad had been m*rdrd, I once angrily asked him “is this what ur dad taught you?!” ) , he was trying to scam me so I let off on him in anger . 

 and ever since then I feel like , even though we don’t speak anymore and it’s been a year, he is plotting against me because apparently he was so upset that I mentioned his dad. 

He stole a lot of money from me by scamming me eventually and later on he even asked me for my full house address &amp; full name 

This set off alarm bells in my head because I instantly thought he wanted revenge and to get to my house and harm my parents as a get back  

Even though I cut him off and it’s been a year I still believe he’s lurking around and will try to harm me and my loved ones 

It puts me off from posting pictures of my self on Instagram because I know he lurks on it probably don’t want to be tracked down 

I have had so many traumatising experiences that I honestly sound crazy 

I’m sick of feeling scared every day 

Any advice or suggestions?

190dax6,Anxiety,2024-01-06,2 months on zoloft,"Hi everyone, I’ve been on Zoloft for 2 months now, was told to start at 25mg for the first week and up to 50mg on the second. Took 50mg for 2 or 3 days and decided to stay at 25mg and have been on that dose since. Overall the cons heavily outweigh the pros, the only pro is I am not waking up in the middle of the night with panic attacks. The cons Include constant nausea, cold sweats, morning anxiety, suppressed appetite, headaches/spacey feeling constantly and vision problems (am currently figuring out if it’s a prescription issue or because of this medication). I am going to speak to my doctor about switching to another alternative, maybe lexapro? I am not familiar with the many other options. I know this is a low dose and am wondering if it’s even possible to have all these issues on such a low dose, I am hoping to get some of your opinions and own experiences with this. Do I stay on this even after 8 weeks with bad symptoms that feel like they are getting worse? (I am 20M)"
190d8tv,Anxiety,2024-01-06,"Sitting next to my sleeping husband, worrying about money and health issues","I'm sure there are many of you across the world who have worked their asses off but are barely surviving in this crappy economic state: having trouble being able to afford anything from electricity to food to booking ""cheap"" holidays. *(Yes I know some of you might be thinking this is just first world problems, at least we have food and water, at least we're not in a war - but aside from that, everyone still has problems and at the end of the day it's all relative).* 

  
My husband and I haven't been on holiday for a few years - it's been eating me up a bit but it also opens up room for my brain to start panicking about other things that we can't afford either that are WAY important than going on holiday. **For starters affording treatment for my worsening back or affording the food in our fridges as well as struggling to sell things to even make like £20 a month or something. On top of that I'm unable to find a new job in months after my redundancy, having a crappy landlord and an expensive place that I don't think we can survive off of my almost-spent savings and husband's low paying job.**  It's obviously not the most stressful situation as I'm sure other people are going through worse but this is it, this is my situation. 

  
I don't have any friends either and I'd like to try not mention this too much in front of my husband otherwise it just stresses him out. I'm the kind of person who needs solutions ""now"" and can't sit still until something's fixed hence why I'm just keeping my brain busy - can't sleep on this anxious brain right now.

I guess I just needed someone to talk to and to also hear what other people are going through so I can feel some solidarity right now.... and feel like I'm not alone :) "

I always feel like I am in flight or fight mode and even when I go through long breaks from responsibilities, I never actually feel fully rested or relaxed.

I want to be very clear that I also have health anxiety and my recent EKGs were clear and perfect. But being a nurse..I know what these symptoms mimic and I’m kind of freaking out. I’ve had one bad panic attack over it today and it’s just a lingering worry. As I’m typing this my jaw is still very sore…kind of like a pressure? But my arm doesn’t hurt.

190c3ig,Anxiety,2024-01-06,Panic attack or something else?,"Hi, so, Ive been getting these attacks for a good while now and Im not sure are they panic attacks or anxiety attacks or what. 

Its hard to breath and I often hyperventilate, feel dizzy and like Im about to faint, I cant hear properly and its hard to stand. Sometimes it starts with shaky hands. There is a feeling of anxiety in my chest but not a pain that I would mistake for a heart attack. No feelings of dying but feel of no control/losing control. Last from a couple of minutes to 15 minutes max. Ive noticed I get them easier when sleep deprived or drunk.

Seems to come out of nowhere at the moment, but when analysing the situation later there is usually something that triggered it and happened like half an hour earlier or so. Or I get one after a really hectic day at work when Im walking home.

Ive learnt that forcing myself to breath out with a focus or breathing with the ""breathing triangle"" gif have helped to get me out of the situation.

It just felt really weird and odd. Then this morning my whole body felt numb. I’ve also been experiencing heavy arms, legs,weird head sensations, eye floaters/flashing lights, and more symptoms.

I thought I was done with these symptoms after switching back to my old medication brand. I’ve had a full neurology work up that included bloodwork, head ct scan, spine mri, brain mri, and eeg. All came back negative.

Sometimes the symptoms happen when I play video games, or afterwards. Sometimes they happen while not playing video games. I’m so worried I’m having seizures or another neurological disorder that the bloodwork, mris or eeg didn’t pickup. 

I’m extremely tired and exhausted from all the physical symptoms I experience. I’ve seen a neurologist, cardiologist, 2 allergists, hematologist, and 2 pulmonologists. The only physical health problems I have are asthma, anemia ,and allergies. 

Yet I’m still in severe pain and physical discomfort all day everyday. 

Everyday I have a new severe ache, pain, or sensation. 
I’ve tried talk therapy, medication, CBT, and intensive exposure response therapy, but my health anxiety , ocd, death ocd , and physical symptoms continue to get worse. I’m currently doing iCBT therapy.

The last time I was this anxious and malnourished, I wound up in the hospital. I don't even know for sure why I'm so anxious because the reasons behind my anxiety are very subconscious. My Gabapentin wasn't working, and I'm waiting on my doctor to increase my Effexor dosage, but even when that's approved, it'll take time for that to kick in. I used to use weed to calm myself down, but I can't do that anymore because of drug tests for work.

Since than i got better and started sleeping normally but it left a mark. Now i have this fear of going to bed because i think i wont be able to sleep and will see the day light rising from my bed. Thinking about it makes falling asleep hard. 

Not sure about the reason why i'm scared this much, there were nights when i did this on purpose and had great time, but it sucks.

I don’t usually post like this but could use some support right now if anyone has the spoons ❤️

I was diagnosed with a minor kidney infection yesterday and prescribed cephalexin. When all is said and done, it’s actually a pretty gentle antibiotic.

That being said, I have some extreme anxiety around medical things, especially taking new medication. I read a ton of scary side effects on the internet and put off taking the antibiotics until this morning. When I woke up I tossed them back before I could turn back because I am in pain and know I need to treat this. No going back now, I need to do this for 5 days.

I felt fine from the first dose but of course I have worked myself into a panic now. Dizziness, nausea, extreme anxiety.

I am not even convinced this is a side effect of the meds, I think I’m just under the weather and also panicking. I’ve been too afraid to eat, and I think that’s making things worse. 

Any reassurance that I will get through these 5 days? I know overall this is a small thing, I’m just alone and struggling. 

Love you all!"

Or from a stress-free time in life to one that’s guaranteed to be stressful? I’m not talking about just not wanting to go back to work on Mondays, but having anxiety attacks and constant crying over having to make a change. 

It may sound strange, but this is where the majority of my anxiety comes from. I also get it with travel. Even having to be away from my comfort zone for a night or two brings me anxiety that consumes my thoughts and I find it hard to function for days before leaving on a trip. Once I am on a trip, my anxiety usually subsides, but if I’m transitioning to a stressful period in life, then my anxiety is at an all-time high.

For instance, I am going back to school tomorrow after being on break for three weeks and I feel like I’m going insane. For some reason, my brain cannot fathom having to go back to a stressful time period and I’m freaking out. I keep crying and don’t want to face the reality of having to do another semester of school.

I feel like no one I’m close with understands that I can’t just shut off the part of my brain making me anxious. I know that I’ve been successful in school before and I have friends there, but my brain keeps telling me that I’m safer in my hometown.

I’ve been on SSRIs for years for anxiety, which seem to help a bit, and I just increased my dose a few months ago, but I now don’t feel like they’re doing anything.

I’ve been going to therapy for a while now, and I’m trying all sorts of strategies that I’ve been taught, but I just can’t shake the voice telling me that I won’t be okay going back to school.

Any advice would be appreciated."

1908f6h,Anxiety,2024-01-06,After another abrupt panic attack I can finally put what it feels like into words,"I'm not looking for specific advice, just yelling into the universe to get it out of my head.

Beyond normal anxiety I have occasional abrupt panic attacks that seem to have no cause. Yesterday being an example that lasted all day.

An hour before waking up, in the time just between dreams and awake, I was trapped in a whirlwind of insane thoughts that were out of control. It was like being trapped on Willy Wonka's creepy boat ride going at 100mph. After eventually breaking free and waking up the more physical symptoms come on. My chest feels like it's being constricted by a giant snake. No matter how many breathing exercises I do I never seem to get enough oxygen. My stomach, despite being empty, feels inflamed and engorged to almost bursting. Muscles are stiff and twitchy and my reflexes pop off at the slightest touch.

The mental side is just as unpleasant. There is nothing wrong, nothing to worry about, but I feel a persistent feeling of being hunted and everything around me is a potential threat. I'm safe, have resources, and support but can't explain what the danger is. My thoughts have (pictured in my mind) shifted from the right side of my brain to the left side of my brain. It is no longer an internal dialogue, now it is flashing images, clips of movies, random imagined scenarios changing 5 times a second. It almost feels like being forced face first through and breaking consecutive TV screens, one after the other.

The abrupt ones are the worst. I didn't reason my way into them so it's hard to reason out of them with meditation, muscle/breathing exercises. This one lasted all day and then just *snap* stopped as abruptly as it came with no explanation. The longest time it has lasted is two weeks; which of course lead to a near total mental break.

At least it feels better to get this out. Hopefully everyone is safe and managing their own trials."

I'm aware it's not the end of the world and that this is just an obstacle i have to conquer but i can't stop thinking about it. 

I've never been one to have panic attacks until 2023 when the abuse intensified, and now whenever i think about my plans i get so anxious my chest starts to go tight and my heart beats so fast and i get lightheaded and i genuinely feel like i'll just die. I've been to the hospital over it once because i was so anxious my chest was going crazy and they didn't take me seriously because my mother was in the room, so i couldn't say something like ""I think i had a panic attack i'm having really bad anxiety"". I was just told to sleep properly. I can normally quell my anxiety with breathing exercises and fresh air but i hate the heart palpitations part it feels like the end of the world.

I'm only typing this because i was just doing the dishes and i started overthinking about my plans to leave my family and my chest hurt so bad i went lightheaded and fell on the floor. So now i've been sent to bed and told to take a pill and i'm just wallowing in self pity i guess??

The last time I took antibiotics was when I was a kid and didnt understand what it meant to take any kind of pills, so i obviously dont remember my expirience. I dont know what pills i took as a child, but I know I didnt have an alergic reaction. I just took my pill about 10 minutes ago and I am terrified of having a reaction. 
I dont know how to stop this fear as it seems like a rational to me. 
Does anyone have any expirience with this?

Thank you &lt;33"
19061al,Anxiety,2024-01-06,Feeling a terrible sense of impending doom.,"Hey folks! Long post incoming (spoilers that discuss sensitive topics like mortality). Not looking for medical advice here per one of the rules, but rather seeking guidance if anyone else has been through something similar or if anyone has a different take on what I might be experiencing. 

In October of this year I came down with a case of SVT while I had strep throat and COVID at the same time (rough I know). I was seen by an electrophysiologist and had numerous EKGs and Echocardiograms done with showed no abnormalities with my heart. November went by relatively normally although I had a heightened sense of anxiety that I never had before. &gt;!Having that SVT episode felt nearly identical to a heart attack and I really had to confront the concept of mortality head on.!&lt; I had CBC, CMP, D Dimer, Troponin, Cholesterol, and A1C tests done soon after this incident which all came back normal. 

Fast forward to early December where I was having dinner with a friend and I literally felt for a moment that time skipped on me (about 1-3 seconds). I didn’t think much of it at the time but as I look back on it more, I feel like that may have been an absence seizure. I mentioned this to an ER doctor a few days ago who said it was likely anxiety but no tests were run. Since then, each day has gotten progressively worse. I have a laundry list of symptoms that’s been plaguing me and now I have an awful, impending feeling of doom for myself. &gt;!I was never particularly health anxious until lately and now I feel like every day may be my last to the point where I’m considering writing down instructions for after I pass away.!&lt; Those around me label all of my symptoms as anxiety, including doctors. I visited a Minute Clinic a week ago because I thought I was simply dealing with an ear infection but the NP said I may have had or am having strokes. An ER doctor dismissed this with a neurological test and chalked it up to COVID and anxiety. But I have a nagging feeling like something serious is going on. I have a GP appointment set up for early February but I feel like I’m racing against an imaginary clock. I’m considering going back to the ER at this point but any sort of guidance would be helpful. 

Some of my symptoms include:

- Lightheadedness that ebbs and flows throughout the day to the point that I may feel like fainting
- Trouble focusing my eyes on one thing
- Isolated headaches on the left side of my head for the last week and a half
- Tightness and pain in my neck. I also find myself hearing fluid (not sure if it’s spinal fluid) in my neck all the time
- Metallic taste in my mouth when I move or cough or sneeze
- Cool rushing sensation through head
- Tingling and cold in hands and legs
- Intense moments of deja vu as well as moments of depersonalization
- Waking up soon after sleeping gasping for air or feeling my heart pounding 
- Extremely heightened sense of impending doom"
1905zjt,Anxiety,2024-01-06,Anxiety when you actually get sick,"When you actually get sick, do you also have crazy health anxiety? 

I caught a very unpleasant virus, it’s going pretty rough and I started to panic. I went to doctors three times, because my headache is weird (“what if it’s meningitis?”), my cough is really bad (“pneumonia?”). My bf is always trying to argue with me, almost calling me crazy, but sure it doesn’t help. 

On a normal occasion I can handle my health anxiety by not reading google etc, but when I’m actually sick, it’s catastrophic."
1905rjj,Anxiety,2024-01-06,Cold and numbness in hands and feet,Posting this to see if anyone can relate. All my life I've been a massive hypochondriac. Been doing well as of late. About 4 weeks or so ago I noticed that my feet/hands have been freezing even though my body feels warm. I work outside so I chalked it up to it being winter but fast forward to now it doesn't matter if I'm inside or outside. My hands and feet are freezing. And now numbness has started. It's on and off. Sometimes will last for hours and then go away. I went to the Dr yesterday mentioned it to him along with the fact I've had trouble sleeping. Thought maybe I was deficient in iron.  He didn't seem alarmed but ordered blood work anyways. Blood work came back normal. Now I'm at a dead end. Can anyone relate to these symptoms? Because now my mind is running rampant thinking that it's something serious.

For context, i’m a 100% not vaccinated against covid as in from the first series. Not a single  jab. I was always hesitant and scared of the possible side effects. Was also at home for years so i wasn’t forced to take it. Now i’m thinking whether i should still take it for my future. I need to change my life around and start to work. Is it worth to take it in 2024 or should i forget about it? I’m losing my mind. I’m scared of side effects and dying from myocarditis. I’ve been up all day and night reading both sides. I also think the original shots that was given out aren’t available anymore in 2024."
193con0,Anxiety,2024-01-10,Only genuine response please. Help me out.,"I have been always a loner. Never had any friends but there was one comfort for me and that was my phone but guess what!  It recently got snatched by thiefs. I was so desperate to get it back that I even fell for a phishing scam and ended up giving them my icloud credentials and phone's passcode since I was trying to locate its then location on find my iphone. That made things even worse for me. (I did take damage control steps afterwards like blocking cards etc).

That phone was my life, it had my whole life in it. My only escape was my phone. I was to attached. I can't even tell the pain I am feeling right now. It had so many of my memories, all my struggles and everything journaled in it.

Not only I am concerned about my privacy since I gave them the credentials. But I am missing my phone too. People say it's all materialistic but it was my only escape from my loneliness. I can't stop regretting whatever has happened. Why God always do this to me!! why

How do I get over it. It's been like two weeks but I am almost crying over it everyday. Feels like I am literally dead inside. Always anxious and feel panicking. I get up at nights and gets chills down my spine. That whole incident repeats in my mind in a loop and I end up regretting everything everytime.

I am literally tired of all this because it is not only affecting my health, my work and other things but most importantly it is affecting my family. I love them and they are so much worried seeing me like this makes me hate myself even more.

My managers and HR listened to the voicemail and spoke about the “stolen AirPods” while we were all in office together.","I admitted that I had them, and explained that I didn’t steal them, but now my anxiety is running because I feel like my co-workers will still see me as a thief.

I did and everything was going great until a month or so ago and the numbness in the hand and foot came back. I told myself repeatedly it's just anxiety and my body was like oh ok, you don't like that? How about some of this instead? So now I get this weird sensation of pressure in the lower part of my face. The only way I know how to describe it is if you hung upside down and let the blood rush to your head, that's how it feels. I just think how crazy it is the body can manifest this illusion of pain or discomfort. Has anyone experienced this type of symptom before? Be well everyone! "
1937cxj,Anxiety,2024-01-10,Working out and Increased anxiety. Looking for people with years of training.,"Forgive the qualifier, I am just looking for input from people who have dabbled with different modalities. I’ll explain; 

I have anxiety/OCD/panic and been working out/training for over a decade. Usually in the CrossFit/strength and conditioning space. I was in excellent shape and was suffering with this illness terribly. Few years back I bulged a disc and moved towards bodybuilding. No HIIT, no intense gasping fo air chippers or conditioning pieces. My cardio was long walks outside. I felt…incredible. I wasn’t waking up in the middle of the night to pee or just in general. My entire personality changed in some ways, I felt calm and open. I was taking damn selfies outside and sending them to my wife 😆.  All that being said,  happy and but discontent.  I liked the intense aspect of working out and wanted to be pushing myself doing extremely difficult workouts. Recently my back got better and I returned to my old workouts and lo and behold the weird stuff returns. Feeling neurotic and like panic is just around the corner, but also as insidious as this illness is, I can’t tell if I’m just psyching myself out. 

Anyhow, sorry for being long winded. I’m curious if there is anyone else out there who has had the same experiences. I would love to continue working out like this, but not at the cost of my wellness. Thanks for any help!"

I have a question.
I know that for anxiety, one of the best things you can do is expose yourself to the fears but what I can’t understand is how do I do that gradually (for certain situations)
Okay for instance: I have a final exam tomorrow AND my first appointment with a psychologist.
I’ve been trying to communicate more with people this week and walk outside more but I don’t feel prepared and Idk how I could make myself prepared? Like, what would be the gradual exposure therapy for a final exam for instance?
(Just so I know and not faint next time If I faint tomorrow lol)

1935c7w,Anxiety,2024-01-10,I’m so scared to leave my home I could cry,"For context, a couple months ago I was home alone and a strange man came up to my door and didn’t say anything but looked inside. My dog was barking very loudly at him and he didn’t leave until a couple minutes after. I constantly think about that day. What if I didn’t bring my dog inside? What if I spoke back and asked him what he was doing? I’m a woman so I immediately thought me speaking would make it worse. I don’t know what his intentions were and I’m scared to ever find out. 

I’m on edge every second whenever I go outside. What if he knows my schedule? Knows that I’m home alone almost every day of the week? What if I’m walking to school and I see him? I remember his eyes because he was wearing a mask. I’m terrified can’t even sleep because then it spirals and feels like everyone is watching me. They’re all out to get me. And I’m scared of not dying but getting kidnapped and being tortured. What if I come back from school and he’s waiting for me inside??? I’m scared and I can’t sleep."

I've started moving past a few of the longstanding personal issues at the root of this, though more have come up in the last two weeks that I'm really struggling with right now.  I'm not sure I can fix them, but I want to start feeling able to manage things again.

I don't really have anyone to tell this to, so I'm not sure who I'm doing it for.  I want to be better, though."
19340ns,Anxiety,2024-01-10,"Someone knocked on my door at 10pm and asked for Someone named ""Angel.""","At 10pm on a rainy night, my family heard someone ring our doorbell. We were all very frightened, as it was late at night, we were not expecting, and our house receives no random visits (our house is extremely easy to miss even during the day, let alone at night)

We did not open the door. My dad began handling the situation. He yelled through the door, ""who is it?""
and the response back sounded to be from a black woman judging on her accent, asking for someone named Angel.

We of course had no idea who Angel was... So we told her she was not here. The car in our driveway was parked there for almost another 10 minutes, im not sure if it was because they weren't sure how to back out or not.

I found out today that when someone asks for Angel, it means they are in danger and need help... My heart sank when I found out. This woman was most likely in immediate danger, and we didn't know. I'm so worried that she is not okay... If by any miracle anyone here knows anything about this, please let me know. Or if you are the person who was asking for Angel if you are okay. 

We live in NC if that narrows it down any.

My sister did call the police and told them about someone asking for Angel... they stationed across the street at a church for almost 3 hours.

I'm just so worried that this woman is not okay, if you were looking for Angel at a dark spooky looking house in North Carolina around 4-5 months ago at 10pm at night, let me know. Or if you know anyone who was, let me know if they're okay please"
19337is,Anxiety,2024-01-10,Fear of quitting SSRI,"I've been taking prozac (fluoxetine) 10mg for the past 4 years for anxiety and panic attacks. In the past 2 years I've developed solid coping mechanisms. I still get anxiety and the occasional panic attack in highly stressful situations, but I'm not afraid of it anymore, I just let it happen and move on with my life.

Now after 4 years I would like to try and see what I m like without the antidepressant. Also I've developed chronic acid reflux and I'm starting to suspect prozac is the culprit. My therapist fully supports this, but I'm so afraid that I'm only feeling so confident because of the meds and once I'm off them all my issues will return.

Did anyone quit their SSRI and managed to stay off them? How does it feel to give them up?"

I just moved across the country because it was something I have always dreamed of doing. This is what I have been looking forward to for years! Im very proud of myself for leaving my comfort zone and making this big change. 
I have two dogs who are everything to me. They have always lived in a house. I knew moving into an apartment would be a big change to them, regarding exercise and using the restroom. However I never thought how they would act when I left. 
Three days after I moved in a received a noise complaint. I found out my dogs had been howling and whining after I left.
For whatever reason, this sent me into a huge anxiety spiral and had caused me to not be able to leave the house. Why do I care about something so silly? I can’t even get myself to go to work.
I believe my dogs have gotten used to being here and are probably behaving better. I just can’t leave the house without having an anxiety attack worrying about what they are doing.

I was told today that sombody would be staying back to train me working nights but I have been doing that and all I have been told is that I was doing a good job.

Sombody asked me today for help putting away stock and I help with the box and went back to what I was doing because I didn't see anymore and later saw her doing more.

When I went to leave yesterday I went to ask is there was anything else they needed and she just said nope I'm going home.
I can't help but think asking makes them think I don't know what has to be done.

192wqgy,Anxiety,2024-01-10,I may be somewhat agoraphobia?,"I can leave the house anytime by myself and go anywhere no problem. I can go anywhere I want anytime. 

BUT if someone else takes me I lose my mind. I would think it’s not being in control and it drives me nuts. I hate going anywhere if I don’t have the wheel. I also don’t like social obligations. Like haircuts, or maybe a something like jury duty where I’m sort of “trapped” because I can’t really leave. I can get up and leave but it’s really awkward doing it. 

My mind plays dirty tricks on me and I’m tired of it. I got a haircut one day and I sat down and my mind said “now you’re trapped with me” and my mind is saying “you can’t up and leave you’re getting haircut” “your heart rate is picking up you’re gonna die in this chair” I had to tell the lady cutting my hair that I had to leave and she expedited my haircut so I could get out of there. Now when I ride with someone in a car somewhere my mind plays the same tricks. “You’re stuck in this car and don’t have control“ and then I start to panic. 

I’ve had anxiety my whole life and it’s been manageable but this little stint hasn’t been easy to deal with. Every time I’m not in “control” my mind makes sure to remind me and then make me increasingly panic. 😠

Why am I so unable to judge and understand my own actions? I have no idea if I’m being manipulated or I’m the one manipulating. Or if I’m over or under reacting.

192p9u4,Anxiety,2024-01-09,Very random sensation!,"Hey everyone.

So lately I’ve been experiencing a very strange sensation and I wanted to hear if people could relate. 

The last few weeks at random times I’ve been experiencing what I can only describe as a cross between a tingle/crawling/static feeling particularly in my hands, face and scalp and on occasion it feels like it covers my body. It’ll last anywhere from a few minutes to an hour or so and comes and goes at will, there isn’t really a trigger. 

It sort of feels like when you get very low grade pins and needles or come in from the cold and you can feel the tingle on your skin. 

It doesn’t cause me any pain or real discomfort it’s just noticeable and a little unpleasant to experience. I’ve definitely had an increase in anxiety the last few weeks so I’m trying to rationalise it as that but my good old brain is trying to convince me it’s worse. 

If anyone could relate that would be great."

The 5 senses and finger touching coping skills never really help because I’m so stuck in my own head, so if anyone has anything super intense to help please let me know! 

 I know there’s times when it just needs to run it’s course but it’s hard when it just happens out of nowhere. I wake up to panic whenever something unpleasant like my dogs barking disrupts my sleep and it feels like I have chills and a heart issue whenever it happens, so if anyone has tips for that let me know.

Ive been dealing with mental health issues for about  8  years now and no one really knows whats wrong with me or how to help so ive really just fallen through the cracks, I have started with a new psychiatrist but im not overly hopeful that it will go anywhere . 

My anxiety gets so bad I dissociate causing me not to be able to drive which my parents kinda look down on. I also cant get a job because I had a really bad co-op exsperiance that tramatized me and caused me to be hospitalized and I already had anxiety about working so now its even worse, I done know what I want to do in terms of school and the thought of actually existing scares me shitless. Ive never really had friends and have just lived in my room so I dont have anything and I know my parents are so sick of my shit they are now trying to force me to do things without them whitch is just casuing me to shut down even more.
Honestly I was hoping I wouldn't be here anymore so I wouldnt have to feel like im living in a constant state of parazlizing anxiety and mental health issues and being a burden to my family but sadly that didnt happen. 

I just dont know what to do anymore, I feel hopeless that I cant function in a way society wants me to and a part of me really dosent want to because I know im going to be miserable.

1920ys2,Anxiety,2024-01-09,Overthinking about what I said to a friend,"I think I was inadvertently rude to my friend when I had no intention of doing so and now I can’t stop stressing out about it.

For some information, I was at a new year’s party last night. It was an all girls event and I was invited by my sorority sister. I went to her house, and there were about six of us. 

Four of us were in the same sorority, and two of whom were her roommates. The host, who invited me, let me call her Lilly for privacy reasons. We’re all graduated now. Anyways, the party went well. We did mood boards, kinda like real life pinterest. Had some cheese and crackers.

When I was on my way out and saying goodbye to everyone, and I hugged one of her roommates and told her it was nice to meet her and that I loved her house, her roommate said, “yeah! come anytime as you like.” I said, “oh ok! yeah if Lilly will let me.” I think my friend (Lilly) and the roommate were a little confused and wheels were churning. 

It seemed like she was like, “why would she say that?” I can’t remember every detail but i think i said that same phrase twice. “Oh yeah! if lilly will *let* me.” My perception is that she might have been offended or thought it was strange. I hope she doesn’t think that I think she’s controlling or something like that. I love her dearly she’s such a great friend but idk. I don’t know why I’m stressing so much about it. I texted her this morning and thanked her for the invite and said i love her. We say it to each other all the time. She responded and thanked me for driving far (about 40 mins) to see her. I said it was totally worth the drive and would do it again. Did i come off as passive aggressive? should I say something to Lilly? I feel anxious about it. If this is relevant I didn’t exactly grow up in a calm childhood. I grew up constantly apologizing. But.. was I rude? I really meant to say, “yes! if lilly wants me to come over.”

191xvmr,Anxiety,2024-01-08,experiences with prozac for anxiety?,"hi guys! i have had very very severe anxiety since i was about 6 years old that has manifested into ocd, dpdr and panic disorder as i’ve gotten older. i have tried lexapro, worked for a while and then stopped. upped my dose a few times &amp; felt no difference. then i did the same thing with zoloft &amp; it worked longer but eventually stopped too. and with both medications, although it reduced my ocd ruminations and constant panic attacks, i still felt my anxiety seeping through. i just got prescribed prozac bc i’m barely eating or sleeping without medication bc everything in my brain is so awful right now. i keep seeing people say prozac is more for depression than anxiety, but has anyone seen any major changes after taking it primarily for anxiety/panic disorder? i’m scared it will make it worse, or it won’t even help at all and i can’t go on like this much longer. i am SO tired but i can never just relax and be at peace. please give me some hope"

I’m visiting my mom and dad because my mom’s is recovering from chemo and I’ve been pretty stable. I don’t know if it’s related, but I didn’t take my usual dose of lorazepam because I’ve been trying to cut down - and after pulling an all-nighter due to fun racing thoughts, I see two moles in my hand I hadn’t seen before while in the car with my parents- and guess who has a complete meltdown? This girl. This girl started freaking out about melanoma in front of my hairless mom. 
Obviously, I apologized profusely after composing myself AFTER 30 mins of non-stop crying and catastrophic thinking- but hey! Wouldn’t life be dull without sporadic scares and crippling existential drama?"
191k0ti,Anxiety,2024-01-08,Are these still just physical anxiety/stress symptoms?,"I (33m) have been battling with stress and anxiety for years due to some trauma in my life, it got so bad that I developed quite bad physical symptoms. Now I have been taking sertraline since the end of October (gradually titrating upwards from 50ml to 150ml) and while many of the symptoms have gone (especially shaking, general sensation of feeling unwell, dry throat, blocked sinuses, facial pressure and spasms) some still remain for example brain fog and difficulty concentrating, a bit of tinnitus, a bit of dizziness/feeling off difficulty sleeping.

I feel like it's relevant to mention that I did a blood test checking vitamin levels, electrolytes, thyroid function,, blood etc and it was all normal apart from the fact that my iron levels were a bit high. 

My gp insists that this is normal that I still have these symptoms and it's all connected to the anxiety and should get better, what do you think?"

190z0y7,Anxiety,2024-01-07,How do I deal with this?,"Okay so I am gonna be honest here. Me and some of my friends were caught using Marijuana during my college days by a professor. Though it was long back, that day still haunts me due to the fear and the professors involved the police into the matter to warn us. I kind of was not sure how I handled it. Though I did use it after, I was always afraid of getting caught again and would have auditory hallucinations. 

I'm generally introverted and was afraid of going into groups to talk and the fear of meeting new people always dawned upon me. I always lead a private life with minimal interactions with people. I think my anxiety levels shot up after the above incident. Because even after so many years, when I think back of it, I get so much irritated and afraid. I don't know if it's PTSD. Am I over-reacting? Should I worry so much for getting caught using something like that? 

I'm not a daily user. I only go for drinking or smoking like once a year or so now, but still if I do it, I get so afraid. 

Has someone felt similar things? How did you cope with it? I feel like anxiety and fear is dawning upon me and I won't be able to lead a proper life.

Any views would be highly appreciated "
190iddu,Anxiety,2024-01-07,can i take xanax?,"
smoked once, was left with despersonalization and psychosis so i stopped. two years passed and im smoking again, but for a full week since my “trips” were a lot more enjoyable and i had absolutely no issues. i’ve been one week off weed and my anxiety is over the roof, have had panic attacks even started despersonalizating again. i know this is a weed induced state so i’m not really looking forward to going on meds because it’ll eventually go away on its own, so is it safe to take .5 of xanax whenever i’m anxious to help get through it or will it have some comedown that will make my anxiety worse?"

I have a quick question… Does anyone else feel a wave of heat flow over their body right before an anxiety attack?

1904kdd,Anxiety,2024-01-06,Feel extremely anxious and have slight pain in chest but my heart rate is low (54 BPM).,"I have a doctor's appointment on monday (in two days.)

I've had issues with anxiety and depression in the past, and I'm on antidepressants, but I'm still just.... ridiculously anxious. Just anxious about everything. 

However, I'd expect my heart rate to INCREASE when I'm having an anxiety filled day, but I just recently got an apple watch and this is the first time I've had a very anxious day since getting it and I checked my heart rate and it measures 54 BPM. That's roughly my resting heart rate (I'm an athlete. My resting heart rate when I'm sleeping is often ~50 BPM.) I'm not worried about the low heart rate, I just find it odd that I'd have such a low heart rate during an anxiety attack. My typical ""walking around doing stuff"" heart rate is 65-75 BPM. (I also checked my heart rate manually and it was, indeed, very slow.)

I do have slight chest discomfort, but nothing I haven't experienced (and told doctors about) before. It actually hurts on the right side of my chest (opposite my heart.) (It happens every time I'm super anxious.)

Any reasons for this? Again, I'll talk to my doctor about it on monday, but I figured I'd ask!

EDIT: I wasn't sitting around for a while when I checked, I was up and about cleaning. A lot of websites are like ""anxiety can cause inactivity which can cause low heart rate"" but I wasn't inactive."
1903sm7,Anxiety,2024-01-06,Supporting someone who won't acknowledge anxiety.,"I've been with my partner for 10+ years and he's someone who I would say has an anxious nature. Periods of being snappy/on edge, feeling nervous for no reason, being overly worried etc. He won't fly and won't deal with his anxiety over it etc.

Today is the 3rd time in a year he has gone to the ER due to heart palpitations, feeling nauseous, light headed. He was initially feeling faint due to over exertion exercising and I honestly think that grew into a panic attack over worries about his heart. Everytime he goes to the hospital there is nothing wrong with him physically.

I don't really know what to do to help him when he won't help himself and acknowledge that these hospital visits may be a result over mental health. Over the years I've encouraged him to meditate, go to the Dr but he hasnt done a thing. 

I can't honestly say I felt much sympathy for him today because he has never once tried to help himself. I know that's terrible of me.

What can I do to support him? What can I do better when he's having these episodes? It's hard to say, stay calm you'll be ok when he doesn't acknowledge it's at least in part anxiety.

Thanks,"

I feel so uncomfortable in my body and in my life and I don’t know what to do. And I have this pressure in my head too, which could be so many things (to be fair I’m getting over not feeling great).

1902v04,Anxiety,2024-01-06,Ongoing Panic Attacks?,"I have been having issues at my job. I have actively been trying to address my concerns with resonable steps to rectify the issues on both my manager, coworkers and my part to no avail. 

Issues came to a head this week and I think I had a panic attack although I was not feeling anxious or panicked? I was absolutely overwhelmed with emotions of anger, sadness and betrayal. My heart started racing, I felt nauseous and feint. This lasted for about 6 or 7 minutes and I was exhausted afterward. 

I have now given my notice and hoped that would alleviate some if not most of my anxiety.

Since then I have carried this heaviness with me (for lack of a better description), in my chest and stomach. I find myself in moments, where I am not busy or distracted, and all those emotions come cascading in. I have to actively concentrate on slow deep breaths, bringing my heart rate down and focusing my thoughts elsewhere. 

Have others experienced this? These types of mini-episodes and several times throughout the day? I know things should (will) get better when I have actually moved on but I also want to ensure that I’m not ignoring signs that I should be addressing this with a professional in the meantime."

They gave me a heart rate monitor that I just turned in, so waiting on the results. My psychiatrist prescribed me hydroxyzine for panic attacks as they seem to keep coming on. I feel tired, weak, depressed and anxious. Breathing techniques seem to work a little bit still tired and never enough sleep. Just looking for any advice anyone can give me. I was prescribed Wellbutrin for the depression but he took me off of that cause I was having side effects. Again, any comments and help I could get I would really appreciate.

1902d7i,Anxiety,2024-01-06,"Luvox, GAD, and Serotonin Syndrome","Hey, wanted to get thoughts about Luvox for GAD vs. OCD. My daughter (now 20) has been on Lexapro for multiple years, but it has appeared to stop helping. She also takes Buspar 10mg twice a day and we've never really been sure if that's made any difference. She has IBS so that has always been intermixed with the anxiety and complicated things. She also has Emetophobia. Mostly it shows up as fear of nausea and gagging which has sometimes been a symptom of her IBS (if she's in a lot of pain). It's all very complicated but I feel pretty confident her symptoms can be explained by the IBS, Anxiety, and Emetophobia. 

So she just had an appointment with her psychiatrist yesterday. It's the second time she's seen him and he's a resident (we have teaching hospital). Based on her descriptions of her anxiety experience (worrying about if she will vomit, basically, but also worries about her future and being scared of something happening to us--she's an only child and relies on us due to the struggles with IBS and anxiety), he thinks she has OCD, pure O type. He did not give her any assessments/questionnaires. I disagree. I'm a mental health counselor and feel pretty comfortable with my understanding of Pure O. I'm certainly willing to be wrong, but my main concern is if the medication she was prescribed--Luvox--will help her if she doesn't actually have OCD but just plain old GAD. I don't want her to spend weeks on a drug if it's not going to be what she needs. Especially because she's suffering so much right now. 

Our other concern is Serotonin Syndrome. I know it's rare but if she's cross tapering with Lexapro and Luvox AND continues to take Buspar, will the risk increase? Anyone have experience with all this? Most specifically, anyone take Luvox for GAD and not OCD?

Sorry for the long winded description. Hopefully it made sense. Thank you for any insights. "

Update: I just got back and I had a really great time. I ended up using makeup which helped with the redness but it obviously doesn’t do much for the texture but it still made me less self conscious.

19012om,Anxiety,2024-01-06,Don't scroll your phone if you want to curb your anxiety," 

The single best thing I ever did for my productivity, mental health, and especially my anxiety was to get off my phone.

I used to constantly scroll my phone, racking up 7+ hours of screen time every day.

What this does is overstimulate you with dopamine (the ""motivator"" chemical) making you unmotivated to do anything else besides scroll. When you're overstimulated, even normal tasks like cooking or working out seem borderline unbearable. It ruins your productivity, worsens your anxiety, and takes out the enjoyment of life.

If you have any desire to improve your life, the best place to start is by reducing your screen time. It is the one bad habit that blocks all other good habits you might have."

19007b3,Anxiety,2024-01-06,Panie and Derealization,"Hi,
Has anyone had a panic attack in which everything changed? A change in body sensation, a change in thinking, a different looking reality?
Has anyone managed to return to their original state? If so, how?"
19002d3,Anxiety,2024-01-06,ANY stimulant gives me EXTREME anxiety.,"Wanted to post and seek out anyone who feels the same. Physical stimulants, and stimulants in general. I'm 23 now, I dipped, smoked cigs, drank, occasionally smoked weed from the time I was 15 to maybe 22 when I quit everything the first time i had a panic attack. I have been sober for over a year now, I have been mellowing out and I smoked some weed. I wish weed did for me what it does for others but it kinda makes my anxiety worse. I hear CBD can help though.

I can't do nicotine anymore. I was addicted but I liked nicotine, I didn't really care. I liked to dip (smokeless tobacco) but I can't handle it anymore. I can't even smell cigarette smoke. Nicotine for me is completely out of the picture. I'm okay with it but, if I go out (lol I never go out my anxiety is too bad) and I want to drink and smoke a drunk cig I absolutely can NOT. 

I liked caffeine, I mean who doesn't? I drank one cup of coffee this morning, got to the gym and was panicking in the car in the parking lot. Made the decision to go home. That's how sensitive to caffeine I have become! like nicotine, caffeine is a no go.

Alcohol is another one, it is the lesser of the three I spoke about already. Some good days I can have a drink or two, it's nice. I don't drink so I'm a total lightweight, it's nice to get a buzz off of one beer or mixed drink, etc. However I don't like to drink too much because it can send me spiraling dowwards too. 

Overstimulation, driving, too much sunlight, crowded places, random occurances. Hell, I got a text message from a random number the other night. They had the wrong number, and I got anxious and started to panic. This is the kind of stuff I go through on a daily. I have really had to make adjustments to my life. 

Even working out!!!! This has to be one of the hardest one for me. i dont do hard cardio anymore, I just walk on the tredmill. Im way too scared to get my heart rate up. I dont think theres anything really wrong with my heart im just always anxious and the slightest thing that throws me off makes me liable to freak out, exercise included. Especially lifting, deadlifts, bench press, squat. I sometimes have to lighten it up and do more reps because doing a heavy lift, the increase in blood pressure and heart rate freak me out. 

How has anxiety effected any of your daily routines and habits? Any of you dealing with some of the same things I am? Talking about it really helps me. This reddit sub is a lifesaver... Feel free to talk about any of your unique triggers and things you've had to cut out of your life. I would love to hear them! "

18zytno,Anxiety,2024-01-06,I Don't Know Anymore,"I was diagnosed with anxiety disorder a few months ago. The odd thing is, I don't really feel any anxiety. Or at least I didn't up until now. I feel normal. But I have been having heart palpitations and MAJOR spikes in blood pressure. They put me on blood pressure pills and they seem to work for the most part, But today is different. I woke up in a cold sweat and nausea. After awhile, I wondered what my blood pressure was and sure enough, 155/95.

After weeks of improvement, I'm back at square one. I'm convinced I have something wrong with me. And now I fear I may have a stroke or heart attack any minute. I feel so exhausted. I had to quit my job right before this all occurred and now I have putrid insurance and going to the doctor has cost me a fortune. They have ran multiple tests, yet can't find anything. The cardiologist seemed like he couldn't care less. I had to switch primary physicians because my old one didn't do anything. My new one has worked hard, but we come up empty handed every time he orders tests and now he seems like he is determined it is anxiety.

And maybe it is. Maybe he is right. But my brain and body won't allow it to be right. I've had the oddest symptoms. Twitching, pain in one leg, numbness, odd sensation going through the back of my neck to my head, etc. My heart rate seems fine, but that's about it. Well, until I have a panic attack. And my panic attacks are a bit different. I don't feel short of breath, but my heart takes off and I have chest pain. Sometimes these attacks only last for a few seconds which seems to be out of the norm. I also don't feel any anxiety until one hits and then it quickly subsides.

I'm starting to feel depressed now and I honestly don't know what to do anymore. I now look at all the fun things I'm missing out on. I want to go hiking, but I'm afraid to have a massive panic attack in the woods now. I want to travel again, but I'm afraid to be away from my parents with this, who have been babying me like I'm a child again because I don't want them to leave in fear that something may happen. I went back to school, but whatever this is seems to keep me from focusing and the meds they gave me will not allow me to focus. My health is bad for my age, in which I have been trying to take steps to address.

I'm sorry, I just had to get this off my chest. Any of you have the experiences that I do? It is a very odd and debilitating disease."

I am in therapy and am talking with a psychiatrist. I will see the psych again next Thursday, and he is discussing putting me on medication. I saw him last two days ago and I said I wanted to wait a week before getting on medication because for some reason I thought it would get better but it's just been getting worse and I won't be able to get ahold of him until at least Monday. Should I stay awake all night and just try my best to relax or should I go to the ER?

If anybody is willing to DM I would really appreciate it.

Edit - it's currently past 4 AM. "

18zyja0,Anxiety,2024-01-06,does medication help?,"my anxiety has gotten worse, to the point where i will start to quickly hyperventilate, my stomach cramps really bad, and i feel cold while sweating whenever i encounter a social situation (even something as simple as the grocery store or the gym.) 
i have never had to take medication for anything, neither my physical or mental health. 
when i told my doctor about my anxiety, she told me about fluoxetine and how she thinks it would help, but my mother told her she wanted to research it before even considering it (i am a minor). 

i wanted to know, if i were to take this medication, would these physical symptoms (stomach pains, hyperventilation, cold sweat, feeling dizzy/sick) be affected? will it just affect my mood? will it make me feel absolutely numb or like a zombie? and, is it an addictive drug? google has not been straight with me while i was trying to figure out some of these things.

i am still not 100% how the anxiety medications work. but if something could help these awful feelings go away, then i would really want to give them a try. maybe someone who has recently started / been on this medication, or another for a while can help me out. 
im very sorry if anything in my question was maybe hard to understand! this is my first time using reddit to actually ask a question and i definitely felt anxious while typing this 😆

 any advice is greatly appreciated ! thank you very much"

18zx9rj,Anxiety,2024-01-06,Does someone experience similar symptoms?,"Hello, already sorry in advance, this will also be a long venting text. I have always been an anxious person, but mainly about very specific social situations, besides that it was bearable. I even travelled alone for over a year, all around the world and had genuienly the best time of my life. 
When I came back, I felt off and depressed, which is normal I guess. Then I moved away and started a new life in a new city, new studies, new job. It was harder than I thought to adjust, but still manageable, but then I caught scabies from someone. The treatment took ages (I am still not a 100% sure I am cured) and completely fucked me up. I developed panic attacks, which were not physical at first. I mainly had racing thoughts, depersonalization/derrealization and the thought that I am going crazy. This thought began to be compulsory, I checked everyday my behaviour and thoughts if I can detect something “crazy/mad” about it, which obviously makes no sense, but I could not stop. The only physical symptom was, that my eye did twitch a lot. And then after a while I had the first real physical panic attack: Could not breath, feeling sick and my hands began to cramp and feeling numb. I thought I’d die and called an ambulance, they calmed me down via phone. Since then I experience all the things that other people here were talking about too, but there is one thing that really stands out for me. I have those brain lightnings and sometimes little lightnings in front of my inner eye, and random muscle contractions. I was checked physically and I am okay, so it has to be mental, but it really freaks me out. Also I am on Escitalopram now, so it could be a side effect but I had the same symptoms before already. The last time I had a panic attack was because I could not sleep (definetely a side effect) and I even had a short acoustic halluzination, which led me to think I become shizophrenic.. I am so tired of all this."
18zx72t,Anxiety,2024-01-06,I threw up from the anxiety again,"After being in bed absolutely depressed for 3 days, I'm wired and paranoid. Which means ultra anxiety time! Which means I just threw up everything in my stomach just now. Why must I always get sick when I'm anxious? The anxiety meds they have me on (sertraline) is only good for social anxiety and the hypo-whatever is only good for sleeping every once in a while (and the odd panic attack). But nothing rn is working for the general anxiety.

I know I won't sleep, I just hope I don't throw up again.

18zx2gd,Anxiety,2024-01-06,Buspar,"I have been on buspar for about 2 and a half months now. I started on 5mg 2x a day, it was awful for me. took that for a month, then upped the dosage to 10mg twice a day which almost literally instantly made a difference. however, I still don’t feel normal. I still have some anxiety, I know it’s not supposed to take it completely away, but this still feels more than an average person, on top of some moderate-severe depression. and honestly the longer I’ve been taking this medicine the less it feels like it’s working. I feel like I’m falling back into a very anxious state again. 

I guess my question is, does buspar work for anyone by itself? does anyone take buspar combined with another medication? do I try something in conjunction with buspar, since I haven’t been feeling 100%?"

18zvtwh,Anxiety,2024-01-06,Fucking hate when people tell me not to care about what other people think (TW. I mention being bullied and hate crimes. briefly mentioned suicide.),"When I tell people that I'm worried about other people when I'm in public they all immediately start telling me i shouldn't worry about what other people think. that I'm strong/handsome/look fine. They don't get that my anxiety stems from the fact I'm scared people are going to hurt me. My anxiety stems from C-PTSD.

I'm a wheelchair user, i know I look like an easy target. Plus, I'm very visibly transgender and live in a very right wing and christian dominated area.

I was bullied *horribly* most of my life for being queer and autistic. I was told to commit suicide and even tried it at one point. I had people purposely trigger my deadly allergies because it was funny to watch me scramble for my inhaler and medication. I had to start wearing turtle neck shirts in school because people would rub lotion with my allergen in it on the back of my neck when i wasn't paying attention. I have been cornered and yelled at by groups of people over things. I have had people threaten me. I even had a stalker at one point thinking he could ""fix me"". 

I am scared I'm going to get hurt or killed when I'm in public. That's what my anxiety is about with people and people don't get it. Everyone thinks I'm worried about people thinking I'm weird and shit talking me. Then, i explain my actual anxiety and get told it's irrational and no one will actually try anything. I explained, very vaguely like i had in the last paragraph, that people have and got told i was trauma dumping."

18zvpyk,Anxiety,2024-01-06,Emergency travel insurance won’t cover my ER visit,"I was visiting my family back in the US for a few weeks and got some emergency insurance just in case.
One night I woke up and started having terrible full body tremors. Eventually calmed down after drinking coconut water and thought it was maybe blood sugar related. Next night same thing happened and I thought I was having seizures, so at 11:00 pm I went to the ER. The shaking had gone down immensely by then but went ahead and got an EKG and other tests with everything normal except a little high heart rate. 
Got told it was an anxiety attack and was sent on my way. 
Two months later I get an email that my claim is rejected and I have a bill over $5,000 for the late ER visit. 
Is there any way to fight it?
I have no idea how I’m going to pay it. I literally thought it was an emergency, and have no past  experiences of an anxiety attack. I’d never even been diagnosed with anxiety. So how can I discern the whether it was an emergency or not?
I got blood tests done at a GP with nothing really out of the ordinary, and she told me to get an MRI once I’m back in the country I live in, just in case. So she is saying there’s a possibility that it’s NOT anxiety.
Is that enough to dispute?"

18zugo3,Anxiety,2024-01-06,Unsupportive sibling with my anxiety and decisions,"My sister seems to have a big opinion on the dilemma I’ve been having about going back to college or going to community college. 

She thinks if I’ll go back to college and be away from home, I’ll have another major freak out, have panic attacks all the time, be miserable basically. 

I had such bad intrusive thoughts last semester that created domino effective of issues: social isolation, burned out, which led to me wanting to be at home. I made the choice after speaking with advisors to go home in parts of November to start medication. 

My sister and I are close but she is absent sometimes at home so she doesn’t know everything. I had a really tough last week due to PMS. My therapist and I have spoken all about this and she seems to have faith in me that I know my triggers and know what caused all my issues at school. 

Meanwhile my sister thinks she knows better. She thinks I’m not being honest with myself with what I want. She thinks I’m following the crowd by going back, which isn’t true, bc I’ve learned how to be independent and get through this shit on my own. She thinks my anxiety and panic attacks are still bad bc I had one the other day, however I was able to pick myself back up and feel better quickly after (which I couldn’t do before meds)  

My medication is working definitely. I have a prn when it gets bad. I know going back to school will put me out of comfort zone but I also believe I will get through the anxiety of it all. 

It’s very disappointing to hear my sister lack confidence in me. She isn’t even home enough to understand my perspective.

I probably left a lot of info out so idk if that makes sense. I’m just ranting."

I’ve been there multiple times obviously and every time i’ve been anxious or nauseous i was physically fine. but it’s still such a scary experience feeling like that 45 minutes away from home.

It's so debilitating.

Currently I've got Netflix on, the AC noise, my husband coughing every 30 seconds, the dogs barking, and my husband watching reels with sound. I wish I didn't hear all the noises and layers 😭😭."
18ztq15,Anxiety,2024-01-06,Feel nervous whenever my mother is not here,"Sort of vague title, but it’s basically what I’m dealing with. Back in March of 2023, I had a nervous breakdown (combined with depressive episode). It was completely random and unwarranted, and literally overnight I had gone from someone outgoing, confident, and capable, to someone who couldn’t leave the house, couldn’t drive, and couldn’t go to class due to severe panic attacks and anxiety. Doctors still don’t know what caused it (two theories: either side effect of going off hormonal birth control, or stress due to grad school). 

I live at home, and for some reason my brain and body decided I could not sleep alone—sleeping alone was terrifying; being alone at all was terrifying. So, my mom slept with me for about a month. She was my rock during this time—when I was gagging and running to the toilet to have anxiety induced diarrhea, she would bring me water and comfort me. She’d rub my back to try and make me fall asleep, and she took days off work to be with me. 

Fast forward to now, nearly a year later, and I’m still recovering from this episode. I’m on antidepressants/anxiety meds (the same ones I took all throughout my teen years but had finally been able to stop taking in 2022), and I’m able to drive and go to class again. I still struggle with being in public spaces for too long, especially if I didn’t drive there myself and I’m reliant on someone else to take me home (I feel trapped). 

Also, I am still nervous and anxious when my mother leaves. Not during the day, as she works, but during the night. For example, she’s spending the night at her sisters house tonight, and I’ve been a nervous wreck (fussy gut, nausea, sweats, restlessness). I think it’s the physical trauma from all those months ago, as the anxiety and panic were worst at night and my mom was there to help. I think I’m subconsciously nervous I’ll have a panic attack while she’s not here and have to get through it on my own (which I’ve had to do before, which is always terrible). 

There’s no purpose to this post, since nobody can really give me advice. It’s more of a rant to express my frustration over the lingering symptoms of a mental breakdown I had nearly a year ago. if any of you read till the end, thanks!

TL;DR: had mental breakdown 1 year ago that mom helped me through—1 year later, still get nervous when mom leaves at night. It sucks."
18ztjmb,Anxiety,2024-01-06,Long term medications?,"I am diagnosed general anxiety disorder and complex ptsd. I spent a lot of my life inside mental institution and traumatized by forced medication. That was over 10 years ago and I’ve been unmedicated since except for the occasional prescribed Xanax when things get really bad. 
I am in therapy currently and my mental state is certainly way better than it was when I was a younger adult, but I feel things creeping back up on me. Panic attacks and flashbacks are returning and I am terrified of becoming dysfunctional again. 
I spoke to my therapist and she said it may not be a bad idea to speak to a psychiatrist. I no longer have a Xanax prescription and thankfully I never got addicted in a sense I abused the drug, but I really need a longterm solution. I’m a working adult now, I can’t afford to have a severe mental episode but I feel like it’s coming. Does anyone have suggestions on medications I can take on a daily basis solely for anxiety?"

18zslhn,Anxiety,2024-01-06,Anxiety around intrusive thoughts that I’m saying out loud at work,"I’m a teacher. I’ve been doing it for years, and for the past three years I’ve been consistently taking lexapro for my anxiety. I also deal with chronic pain, and more often than not, there will be a month here or there where I am prescribed pain medication that interacts negatively with my SSRI. On a good month, I’m not in pain and not taking any meds, so I have low anxiety. This keeps my OCD and intrusive thoughts in check. I’ve had a couple bad weeks recently, so I’m taking the pain meds again and they are getting in the way of my mental health.

So recently the intrusive thoughts have been loud. Nothing relating to self-harm this time around, thank god. But things that are inappropriate to say out loud to high schoolers. I don’t want to be specific, but just imagine like things you would save for a conversation between adults rather than with kids. Nothing that would get me sent to jail. Nothing directed at them specifically.

Today in particular I had a really horrible Freudian slip type moment where I spoke before I could even stop the thought. (I switched a word out by accident and the switched word made a sexual pun. Ooooooops, damn it.)The kid didn’t register this on their face, and honestly, I think it was a “Woosh” over the head type moment. But now I’m full on shame spiraling about slipping up.

Does this happen to anybody else? Have you unwillingly let your intrusive thoughts compromise your professional integrity? How can you stop being disgusted with yourself when intrusive thoughts are inappropriate and they came out accidentally? How do you move forward from this shame productively and work on keeping those intrusive thoughts inside?"

I’m scared. Every time I even think about being behind the wheel, my heart starts to pound. What if I crash? What if I hurt someone? I can’t afford to fix a car or a lawsuit. What if I panic while driving? What if I fuck something up? 

I don’t know how I’m going to manage it. My fiancé, who just started driving himself, says it’s easy. My best friends says they were scared at first too but it’s not bad at all. They say it’s easy too.

18zrq1f,Anxiety,2024-01-06,Thought I couldn’t get off my mind.,"Recently I have been struggling a lot with thinking too much about what strangers thought of me. It made every situation in day to day life a chore. I hated going out. I hated talking to people. I hated being anywhere but in my room alone. I say I hated it but I knew it wasn’t really what I wanted, everything else was just worse. 

Tonight I spent time with good friends who I would consider 2 of my closest friends (I probably have about 10, which I find to be the perfect amount). What I’m realizing now is that I enjoy spending time with these people so much because I can be myself around them. I don’t have to pretend to act or feel any different than how I truly want. I have known them long enough and grown close enough to them that I fully trust they accept me for my true me. 

What I mean is that sometimes the way I act is seen as weird. Like the nerdy, “uh that guy is a geek” kind of weird. As I’ve progressed through about 20 years of life I’ve learned to act in ways that allow me to fit in and have friends and seem normal. 

But, I feel like in the past couple years it started becoming too hard to try to act normal while also worrying what others think. My mind would race thinking about every possible way the conversation could go. 

What I realized while thinking tonight is that it doesn’t matter what other people think because I have no idea what the hell is going on in their head. Shit I don’t even know what’s going on in mine for the most part. What I do know is I like being with people who know the true me. Anyways if you read to the end, this is my first post and I’m hoping this subreddit may be a good way for me to work through things since I’m not good at putting my thoughts into speech."

whats scariest tho is very recently last half hour or so i've been hearing faint music, sometimes that seemvaguely recognisable most not. it's pretty distinct n it's freaking me out is this something possibly onset by anxiety?

18zqjc5,Anxiety,2024-01-06,I Just Want To Know It’ll Get Better,"TW: car accidents, suicidality, drugs

Never made a text reddit post but here it goes. I hope you’re all doing well. I’m not sure how much to share to contextualize but I’ll put what I think is relevant. 

My mental health struggles started around the time I was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes at age 10. I (19) was diagnosed with GAD and SAD around age 13 and have done on and off cognitive-behavioral therapy since. I’ve been through about five therapists and am currently seeking care, but I was told that the location accepting my insurance has a 6 month wait list, hence why I’m here right now. 

I’m currently taking Buspirone 5mg each morning and propanolol to manage my physical anxiety symptoms, but I’ve only been on this regimine for about a week (I tried Lexapro but it made me physically ill and drastically increased my suicidal thoughts). Before this I was on Venlafaxine for about a year and a half, since I was 17. I fell behind on my daily dosage and long story short, got physically sick and mentally fucked from taking it one day after not taking it for a month and a half. 

I think it’s also important to mention I smoked delta 8 almost every day since April 2022 to about October 2023. At first it helped me with my anxiety, but gradually as my tolerance built, it made me feel awful. I would wake up and hit my pen first thing in the morning and try to maintain a high the entire day. It cost me so much money that I should’ve been saving for college, and I’m worried about how delta itself might’ve impacted my health. However I haven’t smoked it in a few months and I’m happy to say I never want to ever again. 

The turning point of my mental health getting gradually worse was when I got into a minor accident the first time I tried to drive to my college campus by myself. It was a very small accident of me hitting someone from behind, going about 15-20 mph. I have not driven outside of my small hometown since, and I haven’t drove anywhere in about three months. My anxiety, both mentally and physically, has gotten so much worse over these three months, to the point where I’ve gotten physically sick multiple times because my anxiety was so bad. This has never happened to me before. I’m starting to skip out on events with friends and family because I can’t handle being in a car. 

There is so much more I could say about my situation, but my post is mainly just to give myself some clarity. I haven’t had a therapist since October and I’ve been holding onto these thoughts for too long. So this is my attempt to connect with people again, people that I know have similar experiences to me. I’ve felt terribly alone recently and I want to try and fix that. 


I’m very scared about my future. But I’m going to try and take care of the things that actually are under my control. If anyone has any advice for dealing with anxiety in the car, I would greatly appreciate it. I have issues concentrating on tasks to distract me (like reading or playing a game), so I’m wondering if anyone has any other tips. I hope you all have a good night. Thanks for reading."
18zq3r8,Anxiety,2024-01-06,Anyone here use CBD to help?,"Been looking into getting a CBD pen to help with anxiety but I don’t know if it’s a good idea or not..used to smoke THC a lot but stopped last year, been having the cravings really bad and it also helped my anxiety.

18zpukp,Anxiety,2024-01-06,"Strange symptoms: tense, shaky and palpitations after hours of conversation/laughing","I’ve suffered  from GAD and PD for about 25 yrs. These strange symptoms first happened about ten yrs ago after several hours of great conversation and laughing with friends.  When driving home, I noticed extreme rigidity throughout my body, twitches and palpitations that lasted for hours.  This has continued to happen over the years in similar circumstances. I wonder if when I’m in these situations, my body remains in a tense state and I’m not breathing steadily? Looking for answers/similar experiences. Thank you 🙏🏻"
18zpp5a,Anxiety,2024-01-06,Struggling with the concepts of the universe and what life actually is,"Around 2 months ago I got high as fuck  and was with my university friend who does physics and I asked him just basic physics questions. This just lead me to watch a bunch of documentaries and YouTube videos about the universe and creation of it and it’s just consumed me , at first in a good curious way. However now all I can think about is the questions that I still haven’t got an awnser for and all the questions that people , who are supposedly experts, don’t know the awnser too. I don’t know why I feel the urge to know it , I understand that it’s an extremely complex topic but I just find it so frustrating that so much is unknown and that I may never get to know the awnsers to these questions which encompass our whole existence within my lifetime.I got even worse today after I saw the same friend, even though I’ve watch so many vids on these theories and shit I still feel just as lost with my place and with the questions I have - like I have no clarity at all.  I’ve always suffered with anxiety , but I kind of feel like (while it’s still been consuming me abit with the thoughts I stated earlier) this anxiety is actually really reasonable and a lot of other people go through it. It would also be nice if people could leave book suggestions around this , could be philosophical /scientific etc"
18zpfwa,Anxiety,2024-01-06,Anxiety Physical symptoms,"Sorry for the long post in advance… Not sure how to start this but here goes. I’ve always known i’ve had anxiety my whole teenage / adult life, however the last few years have had physical symptoms that have led me to believe i may have more serious health issues. I’m going to list some symptoms I have, as i’m generally curious if anyone else experiences these on a regular basis, and if so how you were able to overcome them. 

- Difficulty Concentrating 
Mainly notice this when i’m driving, almost feels like my eyes are slow to move around if that makes sense. I also notice this when talking to certain people where it feels like i can’t really focus on everything they may be saying. Also noticed when i play video games. 

- Weird Pressure feeling on side of head 
This is one of my most difficult symptoms, where it’s not a headache but more of a heavy feeling on one side of my head. This feeling will last days and then go away and come back etc. This also ties into not being able to concentrate. I will occasionally get headaches but not a daily occurrence and those are usually linked to higher anxiety situations/days.

- Eye Twitch 
Once and a while my eye will twitch and it’s just a weird annoying feeling

- Light sensitivity 

- Depersonalization / Feeling of life not being real

-Brain Fog 

- Fatigue


These symptoms are on and off which makes me think they relate to anxiety, they also get worse in social encounters. (definitely have social anxiety) But for reference i am a 23 year old male, and these symptoms really started occurring in 2020. I first noticed these after smoking a lot of weed one night which led to me feeling very weird and sort of chasing what i now realize as a panic attack. ( haven’t smoked in over a year now ) The brain fog really started after that, along with difficulty breathing for a week or so. At the time i thought i had covid but that was negative. I also have health anxiety where these symptoms make me think i have either a brain tumor or something more serious. I’m just generally sick of not feeling 100%, and want my normal life back. I have had bloodwork etc and everything comes back normal and my dr has said i’m totally healthy. I do not want to take any sort of pills and have thought about therapy but not sure how much that would help.

Any advice is greatly appreciated, and again very sorry for this being so long. Have a nice new year everyone. 🙏🏻"
18zpcnq,Anxiety,2024-01-06,COVID with anxiety is hell,"My anxiety levels usually run high, which can often affect breathing.

I've had COVID for 8 days and I'm trying to get over it, but the virus seems to exacerbate my breathing and anxiety problems.

I have to go back to work next week and don't know how I'm going to do it."
18zpaqr,Anxiety,2024-01-06,Chronic anxiety without regular sex,"Hi all,

If my wife and I go more than 2 days without sex, my anxiety skyrockets. I get moody, sad and even depressed and feel hopeless.

My wife is amazing and it's not that I'm getting rejected or we aren't happy - life just gets in the way. We go out late, she's tired, the kids are up late, etc.

Any idea why my anxiety gets like this? When we have sex again, I'm completely fine and back to my happy, optimistic self. But with no sex for more than 2 days, I feel like it's a ""doomsday"" event and all I can focus on is that we haven't had sex for however many days it's been.

If anyone knows what this is (GAD? Something else?) or has any tips on how to fix/deal with it, I'd love to hear from you. It's been happening for maybe a year or so..."
18zosv4,Anxiety,2024-01-06,Upping medicine dosage?,"When did you decide it was time to up your medicine dosage? I’m going through a stressful period at work right now, and it seems my anxiety went from a 1-2 back to a 5-6 on the daily again. I’ve been on Sertraline 50mg for about 3 months now. 

I’m sure it’s different for everyone, but just curious about others experiences. My next therapy session in Jan 26th, so I’m trying to hold off on contacting my doctor until I speak to my therapist first."
18zornc,Anxiety,2024-01-06,finally out of my panic,"I am finally feeling okay again after a week from HELL when it comes to my anxiety. For awhile I didn’t feel like my escitalopram was doing as well as it used to, so my doc and I made a plan for me to wean off to try something else instead. About 4 weeks into it, almost completed weaned off, I injured my foot falling down the stairs. the X-Ray results I got 3 days later made me SPIRAL. Started escitalopram again. Finding out I had a “displaced” fracture, along with virtually no anxiety meds in my system… to say I was a mess is an understatement. 
Every morning I would wake up in a panic, heart beating like crazy. I had 0 appetite, the only thing I was able to force down was done plain bread. I’ve never experienced something so scary and debilitating, and it’s so insane to me that it was all because of my head. Virtually no pain in my foot and things could have been sooo much worse. Usually counting my blessings makes me feel better, not even TV was distracting me. I felt like I had no escape besides sleep. That turned into being afraid to wake up. I was struggling so, so hard, and it felt like it was for no reason. 
I have an amazing doc who was able to prescribe some fast acting anxiety meds, and BOY did they help 😭 I actually feel like I can breathe again. I know to only take as needed and I’m very cautious about this kind of thing, but it’s nice to have in case the panic comes back before my regular meds kick back in. 
That state of panic, anxiety, stress, whatever it was - that was horrrrrrid. If anyone reading this feels that way, please know that you’re not alone. You just need to hold on, it will get better. Modern medicine has come such a long way and I am just so thankful as a person whose brain chemicals are constantly imbalanced. This is starting to sound like an ad for big pharma lmaoo but I really just am so grateful that something helped me."
18zoqrk,Anxiety,2024-01-06,Buspar feels like a tiny vacuum sucking out my brain and balance cells,"I've been taking 1200 MG of Gabapentin daily for 4 months, as well as 10 mg 2 po daily of propronanol. Mainly for C-PTSD related anxiety and social anxiety. The first two helped a lot with my driving fears, but my agoraphobia is still really bad. I started 7.5 mg 2 po daily of buspar and I feel like I am on my way out.  When does this dizziness subside?"
18zoiec,Anxiety,2024-01-06,I think I made a small scratch on some metal on the base of a 30 foot tower with cameras on it at work. I'm having extreme anxiety.,"A couple days ago I was leaving work and I heard a small noice when I drove, sometimes my car makes a squkey noise, but I wasn't sure, so I got out of my car and looked at my car to see if I hit something, or not. I couldn't see any damage to my car, so I went near this large piece of equipment that has a camera tower and I looked around there and I didn't notice anything, one of the yellow brackets on there looked in a different position, but I checked and it moves freely to any positions, so I realized that I couldn't of hit that, I left my job because I didn't see anything wrong with anything after I checked. A couple days later I was working and passed by and I see a small chip in the paint on one of the yellow brackets that I didn't see there when I looked last time. Now I'm having anxiety over possibly getting fired over it because it might look like on camera that I left after hitting it, but I didn't see anything on my car, or around that area where I parked. It's missing yellow paint, and has black on it. I looked at my car,and I don't see yellow paint on there that happens to be missing from that yellow bracket. It's really small and they probably won't check the 24 hour footage that runs each day just for a small amount of missing yellow paint from the bracket on the camera tower, but I'm really scared I might lose my job because of it. Especially because I just now noticed after a couple of days and I never said anything on the first day because I didn't see it. I also don't want to take responsibility for something I might not even have done. It looks like the camera towers can't see from the angle with the big solar panels in there, but they can definitely see me checking of I did anything and leaving, I'm having really bad anxiety over this. Which maybe potentially something they're not even going to care about.  Some guy saw me checking my car, and asked if I hit anything, or if my car was damaged, because he saw me hop out and look at my car. I told him ""I can't see anything on my car""."

18zngoi,Anxiety,2024-01-06,Is this passive aggressive or am I just taking things too personally?,"Note that I’m what would be considered quote on quote the “dumb sibling”. I’ve been slow my whole life, constantly fail and mess up and my sister and other people sometimes needs to tell me how to do things.

I live with my older sister and we share the bills. She said she found a program to lower our Wi-Fi bill if you make less than a certain amount every year. She makes more than me which was why she suggested it so I was like cool and went to the website while she sat next to me to tell me how to sign up. I sat for a while trying to login to my H&amp;R Block account, and having not logged into it since tax season I didn’t remember the password, which I said “I don’t even think I remember the password” out loud. She says “Never mind” and quickly walks out my room back into her room going on with the evening. I was just…confused. I didn’t say I couldn’t do it I just said I didn’t remember the password. I said this to her through her closed room door and she says “figure it out”.
She didn’t exactly say it in a mean way it was just abrupt and idk it just felt like she was trying not to seem impatient but didn’t hide it well. 
I hate when she does this. Like if you’re gonna be that impatient just don’t bother with me at all. This is one of the reasons I can’t wait to move out. I won’t be put off by this kind of attitude anymore. "
18zn7wz,Anxiety,2024-01-06,Scared I’m going to die on my birthday,So a few days ago I was looking at disturbing facts and one of them said you’re more likely to die on your birthday than any other day and the fact popped up multiple times and I panicked because my birthday was in 4 days at that point. Skip to yesterday and I was on the train and I started getting palpitations so I started worrying again about the fact. Got off the train and walked to my aunts house up the hill and once I got up the hill I couldn’t breathe and I’ve been feeling short of breath ever since even today which is my birthday. I don’t feel any better and I’m so scared that I’m going to die. My heart is still beating quickly and I feel weak and my stomach hurts. I know it’s anxiety but I still can’t stop worrying about that fact. I’m so scared and I can’t sit still. I turned  18 today and I’m in my happy place so I can’t be suffering. I came to visit my aunt for my birthday and enjoy myself but I can’t stop worrying or shake the feeling of dying. Usually whenever I go to my aunts all my anxiety and depression goes away and I feel alive but it’s different now. My grounding techniques aren’t working and I can’t calm down. I don’t want to tell my aunt that I’m not happy beca she’ll say “aw don’t be silly” etc but I want to be happy and I just can’t. I need to hug someone badly so I can relax.

I’ve been dealing with some pretty crazy body aches, headaches, and just feeling really weird overall. I got sent home from work today because I just couldn’t hold it together.

I have had mild social anxiety my entire life but the last 3 years it has gotten so bad (mostly health anxiety). I didn't realize I had anxiety until I talked with some friends who have been diagnosed, and they say mine is worse than theirs. Where do I start? I'm assuming just a general checkup. Do I mention anxiety to the doctor, or am I trying to get a referral? I'm really not sure how all this works. I would love to get some care for my anxiety"
18zm8z8,Anxiety,2024-01-06,I have scelerophobia(fear or criminals),"This started in the countryside when our back garden and garage was broken into by teenagers who stole my brother’s motorbike(both happened different times). I would be scared of being left alone at home and would always hear things, and would stop and listen if someones in or not. Somehow I got over it after a while. Fast forward when I moved to London, was walking to a friend’s house at 1 am with 2 other friends. Happened in WestLondon, it was dark, about 8-10 black teenagers were following us asking what phone we had, at first I didnt think they were asking with the intention of robbing us because I had never been in such situation. My 2 other friends got away and I was the only one who got caught, took my phones, wallet even my slides lol. They pinned me on the ground and 5 girls were surrounding me, the others were boys, one of the girl was demaning for my password with a pointed scissors pointing 1cm away from my eyes. Had no choice but to give it to them. Police came 20 mins late, they were no help at all. 

So, after all this. I now have fear of every type of criminal possible, I get anxious when I think about getting killed or stabbed. I would always watch and read about crimes in london and my area and get anxious reading it. And as racist as it may sound, I get nervous when I’m around young black people wearing tracksuits or tech. How tf do I overcome this it’s almost a year since it happened and I’m still scared to carry my phone around london so I would bring my old phone just so I wouldnt care if it ever happened again. 🥲"
18zlxvv,Anxiety,2024-01-06,I did it!,"I've been chronically lonely for a looong time. So i decided to make an effort to change that and went to a book lovers event. I had a blast. I met so many nice people with whom i talked until my tongue went numb. I felt like i could fly.
It's very important to mention i was completly terrified about going 
""What if i get there too late?"" I thought. Ended up wasting 6$ on an uber instead of a 25 min walk just so im not late. 
I get there, I realize i dont know anyone or even how anybody looks( including the coordimator). I try to message her, she doesnt answer. I get even more stressed, i think ""maybe its a traffiking scheme"" Im terrified people think im crazy for walking around aimlessly, im too coward to even ask anyone if they are there for the event or just coffee. 
Then the coordinator shows up, leads us all to our area and we all have the time of our lives. Up to that point, i was so stressed I felt sick and really wanted to just call it quits at times. 

But i didn't

18zkvgq,Anxiety,2024-01-05,Going off meds after a long time?,"So I was diagnosed years ago with General Anxiety Disorder, but I know after living with it for years that it's almost exclusively health anxiety focused. I've been on Lexapro since 2006, first starting with a tiny 5mg dose before going to 10mg a few years later. 

Now in my 40s I'm still just 'managing' with very few panic attacks, but I'm realizing it isn't really solving it for me. It also resulted in weight gain that, among other things, is more stubborn and unhealthy as I age (as well as loss of libido).

I've never done therapy of any kind, though. Not because I'm opposed to it but because thinking and talking about the anxiety is itself an anxiety trigger. 

That said, I'm considering swapping Lexapro for therapy. I realize both might be better but I do want to lose the side effects of the meds as well. 

Any advice for replacing meds with therapy, and any stories of someone leaving Lexapro after something like 17+ years?

Thanks"

Today was my second day and I’m nervous to increase tomorrow since I am having some increased anxiety, brain fog, feeling unwell and dull. 

On the one hand I would like to go ahead and get the symptoms out of the way quicker instead of being on 5 mg for a week and then starting symptoms over going up to 10, but I’m worried the symptoms will feel too extreme. Anyone else dose up this soon?"
18zkf76,Anxiety,2024-01-05,About Anxiety Muscle Cramps/Spasms,"Disclaimer: I do not have an anxiety disorder, I’m just asking those who do for educational purposes.

I’m writing a story with an MC who has a severe anxiety disorder (won’t give her a diagnosis for respect and show-not-tell purposes). Anyways, I’ve been asking a close friend of mine how it feels so I can write my character accurately.

She recommended that I give the character muscle spasms/cramps that hurt very badly since it fit a specific scene/turning point in my story well.

I have a few more questions about them for anyone else who suffers from this or knows what it’s like:

How long do these last?

What is recommended to stop them? (I need in-the-moment answers; not things like “improving diet”, etc)

18zkemh,Anxiety,2024-01-05,Any advice about my completely irrational anxiety about school,"I just want any advice, or suggestions of what works. I am 16 and have been dealing with awful anxiety for ages.

For the last 2/3 years, I have been gagging or throwing up, tight chest, teeth chattering, hands shaking, numbness in my arms and legs, permanently locked/clicky jaw, feeling light-headed and from the second I wake up I have a pain in my stomach and I often wake up early because of it. My symptoms used to be more mild and I would only throw up in very high-stress circumstances (before an exam) but over the last few months 95% of days I have had pretty extreme symptoms ones I usually get before exams just because I have that lesson at some point in the day.

My anxiety is due to a single subject - I'm very good at this subject, I enjoy it and have completed all of the content we need to know 2 years early, so there really is no reason for me to feel this way but I still do. I'm exposed to this feeling every day sometimes multiple times a day as I never miss school so exposure therapy is doing nothing even when I'm halfway through the lesson and I KNOW it's going to be fine and all of my other lessons have been fine I still feel awful. 

My anxiety is also made a lot worse by my physical symptoms I dread going to school in case I throw up in front of teachers or students so more anxiety and I struggle with breathing exercises because of my tight chest and I expect to feel awful now it has become a normal experience in my day to day life so I guess I worry by default.

Because I'm so used to worrying during breaks my health anxiety kicks right in, I've had it all my life, but when I'm off of school I spend the whole time convincing myself I have any disease under the sun.

I've tried writing things down, accepting it, exposure, chatting to friends, meditation, breathing work, and counting - basically every self-help thing you can do.

Haven't told my parents anything so I haven't been to a GP or anything to get professional help but if they prescribe medication which I would like as it seems like the only solution I'm scared of the side effects or getting addicted. Is it just best to suck it up and speak to my parents to see a doctor?

18zjv1g,Anxiety,2024-01-05,"Exposure, am I doing it right?","After a really long period of very little anxiety, I have landed in a period of suffering from bad sensory overload in crowded places and when I look at screens. It started last week after a panic attack.

Thinking that maybe I ""strained"" my nervous system to trigger this, I have been resting whenever I could and mostly reading, meditating and listening to soothing music but it hasn't improved.

So today, when I got really bad sensory overload at a crowded bar, I said fuck it. I decided to stay. For 2 hours my nervous system stayed in overdrive. Chest was all contracted, hands sweaty, shaky legs, jaw clenched. I went through waves of bad anxiety, often feeling on the edge of panic. It never got to an actually comfortable level but I didn't flee. Afterward I even went to a restaurant to get some food, still feeling quite uncomfortable. 

Now I got home and I feel super exhausted from being fully on for 3 hours.

Am I doing it right? Or am I overexerting with the exposure? Will saying ""fuck it"" lead to desensitizing my nervous system back to normal levels? Or can I actually overdo it and make my anxious episode last longer?"
18zjrea,Anxiety,2024-01-05,Learning to drive,"I’m 18 and I’m struggling to learn how to drive.

Since I’m in an urban area, it’s very hard to find parking lots that don’t contain many cars. Trying to learn for the first time means I’m not comfortable in a car, have no muscle memory, and it feels like I could make a wrong move at any moment.

Just sitting in a car causes me immense anxiety. There’s cars, there’s people, there’s so many things that could go wrong when I’m in control of such a big machine. Even though, for context, we’re in a parking lot half-full of parked cars. As calm as it gets lol. It’s frustrating to see so many people drive with ease when I can’t even drive in these conditions.

I just wish there was a really big, open lot with no cars so I could at least learn to take control of a car without any of those risks. But I don’t seem to have that luxury.

I hate it so much. I know I have to get my license but it’s too overwhelming. I don’t know what to do…

TW: drug overdose, death  
Hi there,  
I'm a 32 female, 5'2, overweight most of my life, I have PCOS and elevated blood pressure. I was diagnosed with GAD when I was 20 years old by my therapist who I still see now, just not as regularly even though I should. I have been ""fine"" for years, meaning if I had anxiety I couldn't tell...I have read that as you get older it can manifest in different ways than when you were younger. My mom died in July of 2021 and even though it was a heartbreaking thing and rough for both me and my family...I think by now we're starting to slowly heal from it. I know healing takes time and to not rush it and grief lasts a lifetime, my mothers death still has an impact on me. She was 58 when she died of CHF (side note she had diabetes years before and also overdosed 2-3 times on her antidepressants when she was around 50-52 years old which her doctor said did substantial damage to her heart.) I got COVID back in February 2023 and when I tell you I am terrified of Covid...there aren't words to describe it. So many people have died from it and I knew a coworker who caught COVID and then 2 weeks later died of cardiac arrest. It pissed me off because I still do all and everything to avoid COVID, I mask, use hepa filters, stay away from big crowds and when horrible surges (like right now) happen I never eat inside restaurants. I also have been jobless for about 6 months (recently got hired) and during that time I felt worthless and useless because my husband was the only one bringing home the money. Im sorry Im ranting, now let's get to why Im actually writing...a few months ago I had surgery TWICE to get a fistula fixed. I had to get an EKG and it had that prompt writing on top that said ""possible left ventricular enlargement"" and ""possible right bundle block"" Long story short I freaked the F\*ck out. My surgeon, anesthesiologist, and my PCP all looked at my EKG and assured me there was absolutely nothing to worry about, so that made me feel better. What's been bothering me since then is the fact that my blood pressure has been between 130/90-145/97 every time I've gone to the doctor. My PCP did prescribe me one medication for it and I have been taking it every morning. I feel like I'm overreacting because I have a good 80-90 pounds to lose and I have the blood pressure I do because I weigh what I do, it comes with the territory if you have extra weight. MY anxiety is telling me that COVID caused my higher blood pressure and that there's nothing I can do about it and will just die of a heart attack or stroke in the next 5 years. I have been walking a lot more, eating healthier, and when I REALLY need it I take a clonopan because sometimes I feel like Im going to hyperventilate into a coma or something. Now that I type it out it seems a little silly...but this is anxiety Reddit and I was wondering if any of you have gone through anything similar or you have any good, positive stories to share with me, or any encouragement? I would greatly appreciate it and thank you for reading. "

i have to present a poem next thursday, and my teacher is letting me do it in a study period, one on one, because i broke down in class just talking about it. this is only ussually allowed for people that have accommodations and it’s making me wonder if i am eligible for those aswell. do any of you have experience with a 504 or iep for anxiety? and if it would allow me to either sit out, or do it at another time?"

18ziju8,Anxiety,2024-01-05,Scared of Heart Pain,"At first, my blood pressure started to rise, so I thought I had to go to a cardiologist to see if there was something wrong with my heart. After all the tests and determining that there was nothing there, I was left with the simple answer of ""you have something, but it's not the heart"".   
A couple of months later I had the symptoms again, even going to the emergency room 2 times for elevated blood pressure. I changed cardiologist and he asked me to repeat all the tests, as he did not make sense of the previous results.   
So we came to the same conclusion as before, everything was fine with the heart, but this time the answer was that I had to see a Psychiatrist, since it was for a Generalized Anxiety Disorder. While I was getting the time he gave me Bisoprolol 5mg to take daily with breakfast.  
I managed to see a psychiatrist and he prescribed Pregabalin 150mg (75mg x 2) and Fluoxetine (100mg). He told me that I could slowly start the treatment along with the Bisoprolol while I waited for an hour with the cardiologist to lower that medication. The thing is that I have been feeling very bad taking the 3 medications together, my heartbeat is around 47 beats per minute during the day, I feel dizzy, very sleepy and last night I could not sleep because of a strong pain in my chest, like angina. My chest and arms were burning, when I got up I got dizzy and started sweating cold.   
I don't know what to do. During the day I have measured my heartbeat and it doesn't go over 60 beats per minute. Every now and then my chest hurts. Should I stop taking the medicine?"

I mainly work in the office but I do have to help out in other departments due to us being a small team.

Everyday I wake up like an hour or two before my alarm due to anxiety about the day ahead. I had my 6 months meeting with my boss today who is nice. He told me what he wants from me in 2024 and it has caused my anxiety to sky rocket! He noticed that I am reluctant to help out on the sales counter and answer the phone. I didn't tell him it's because I have GAD and SA. I just told him it's because I don't know what the customers are asking. We sell thousands of different products and I have no knowledge what so ever about them. I went to college to do office work, not this stuff. He said that I will need to start helping more on the counter starting in the morning. I feel all I can do is worry about work 24/7 and it's depressing me."

It was so scary because not only was the hives itchy and burning like hell, I was also panicking which caused me to feel faint etc...

18zhcvy,Anxiety,2024-01-05,Physical Anxiety?,"This is a long post... I'm gonna kind of go into detail about what happened to me June 2023. I had a fever for a few days with no other symptoms. Woke up on day 4 dizzy and neck aching. The ER said nothing about the neck pain but prescribed me cyclobenzaprine anyways. They said my bloodwork implied a virus and said to let it run its course. 
A month later I still had dizziness and neck pain even though the illness had passed. I was watching an episode of Mayans MC which was graphic and made me feel a little anxious when suddenly my throat tightened and I felt like I was gonna pass out and couldn't breathe good... my husband rushed me to the ER. I was still feeling constricted of air and basically dizzier than before and my neck pain turned into feeling like my head was going to explode (almost felt drunk too honestly) and I couldn't swallow nor was I producing saliva at that point, my jaw tensed up so bad (I couldn't eat or talk much for several days after) They did a CT Scan with contrast, didn't find anything, they gave me benadryl and it did nothing and then they gave me valium which helped a fair amount. My airways from the moment I got in there were clear and my oxygen level was perfect... anyways.. they sent me on my way with wanting me to follow up for dysphagia and thats it.
Now in July I'm at my PCP, he sends me to a TMJ specialist, and ENT &amp; A spine specialist. We try to cover all bases. My MRI on my neck came back with tiny tiny bulging discs in my upper cervical spine no neural impingements but both the specialist and PCP said you could take a huge sample of people and almost everyone will have one. He said it was minuscule and there was nothing to be worried about nor was it causing me these problems. My MRI did also show muscle spasm as well which was noted but wasn't addressed.. my PCP said it's obviously neck muscle strain and sent me to PT. While doing PT twice a week, certain exercises would start making it hard to swallow. But never really fixed anything. The ENT scoped down my throat in office and said all was good. TMJ Specialist cone beam scan was fine, while I have had TMJ my whole life, what I have experienced there's not really any reason to fix it. Its just a painless popping.
Its now been 7 months and my neck still randomly flares up causing jaw tension too, but it like makes me randomly slightly dizzy still or woozy and I randomly feel like I can't swallow which makes me hyper-fixate on it probably making it worse. My neck gets so tense that I end up feeling like my head is too heavy for my body. All this is exacerbated by driving, being in social situations, stress, etc. 
Now my doctor thinks its just anxiety. That I may not feel like I have anxiety (because I don't feel anxious I know what anxiety feels like in the past) but I'm just having the physical symptoms of anxiety. Sometimes I feel randomly panicky when my neck is inflamed but it comes on its own. Very rarely. 
I guess my question is, does this SEEM like physical anxiety?! I've had so many tests done from bloodwork 5 times in 7 months, to MRI's to, CT's with and without contrast... and nothing ever comes of it. My bloodwork has always shown ""inflammation"" they say. But nothing else to be concerned about. 
Could this potentially be physical symptoms of anxiety only without the feeling of being anxious?! Or does this sound like something is being missed somewhere?! 
I don't like taking meds, I have never liked taking them unless absolutely necessary. I have always tried the natural route. So honestly the thought of being on meds for anxiety makes me stressed.
I will add that the past 14 months have been stressful as my child came forward with some awful things the other bio parent was doing and it has turned into a felonly criminal case that's far from over and civil case of taking away custody and a lifetime protective order, then she developed Psychogenic Non-epileptic Seizures from addressing the trauma, so there's been a lot going on in the background of our lives. I went through therapy myself during this time because it was a lot for me and I also did EMDR therapy and was feeling better and then a month after completion my health does this. 
I guess i'm just looking to see if this is normal and could really be physical anxiety. Not needing a diagnosis just needing help understanding if this really could be that. I'm tired of feeling like something is being missed. I've advocated for myself so hard and feel defeated."

Anxiety is your body trying to tell you that something is wrong. This can be something physical, mental, or both or even something completely different. The idea is to find the cause and work towards it. Not just putting out the alarms.

18zh014,Anxiety,2024-01-05,How concerned should young men be about PSSD when considering starting an ssri for anxiety?,"I am a 23 year old 6' 160 pound male with anxiety, asthma and have dealt with post concussion syndrome in the past.

My anxiety was very manageable for years and I had no holdbacks in day to day life until a couple months ago when I experienced a massive spike out of nowhere. It started with full body physically debilitating anxiety whenever I would go out in public then evolved to daily constant panic attacks for a short time and now has improved but I still deal with a very significant baseline anxiety on a near daily basis, besides the odd day where I may feel better naturally or when I take a klonopine (once or twice per week over the past month). 

I am kinda against long term medication overall but in this case I really want my old life back and it just seems like its so hard to get rid of this stubborn layer of baseline anxiety that grips me constantly. I am in therapy and considering starting a ssri but am afraid of permanent sexual side effects or the condition known as PSSD. I cant really seem to get a good assessment on how common and how medically 'real' this condition. I have asked 3 seperate doctors as well as my therapist and non of them had heard of the condition so they could not really help me much.

If I do not take the medication is there anyway for me to get through this stretch and get back to how I was naturally? I am also gonna do a blood test today to see if I might have any deficiencies cause this current stretch of super intense anxiety kind of popped up out of nowhere. Any more advice would me much appreciated."
18zgo7c,Anxiety,2024-01-05,I have been diagnosed with RVOT PVCs,"To start off, I m a 29yr old female diagnosed with PCOS for 5+ years. My weight is 80kg and my BMI is 29.6. My height is 165.5cm.


I started getting this skip beats feeling in my chest in June 2023. At first I thought its just my stomach acting up but that sensation didn't stop. So i eventually checked my pulse and realised my heart is not beating normally. I was paranoid. Eventually I realised its skipping beats. For a few months I spent my days stressing and overthinking. I asked my doctor friends if they had any idea and they all told me its all in my head &amp; its probably anxiety/stress induced. I kept getting skip beats for months, every single day. On October 6th 2023, I decided to get a 24h Holter test done along with an echocardiogram &amp; stress test. I was scared but during my holter test, I could feel my heart skipping beats NON STOP. 

Eventually my results came in. During my stress test, I didn't get any PVCs but in the rest period, I had continuous PVCs. My heart size is normal, the electrolytes came back normal, no thyroid issue either.  

The doctor told me I had RVOT PVCs and there is nothing to worry about. Its probably stress induced.
I returned home and just like any human being, I went to google for research. Fun fact, I don't drink coffee, I don't smoke, I don't drink alcohol, I don't do drugs, I don't have any sorts of allergies hence no meds. Yes I don't exercise at all due to the hormonal changes caused by PCOS and the fact that I had non-stop periods for an year and was anaemic (8.8) but took iron supplements to compensate for the blood loss. 

I always wondered if I had PVCs during sleep (I am not aware of them as I m sleeping) and the holter test was also a little messed up (maybe printing mistake or something) but the doctor didn't point out any abnormality so I assumed I don't have any PVCs during sleep.

Fast forward to Jan 2024, I asked my sister to check my pulse when I am asleep and she informed me that my heart skip beats while I m in deep sleep too. 

I snore at night. Not continuous but I do. However I don't have any issue sleeping or breathing (I guess). I am not sure whats causing the PVCs. I m worried if something will happen to me. What is the doctor misdiagnosed me? What if I have sleep apnea? What if I have a heart issue? Maybe its related to my PCOS? I try my best to be positive everyday but when I feel the skip beat, I lose all my energy and I become anxious &amp; depressed. 

I get PVCs when I go to the washroom, I get them before, during &amp; after meals, I get them lying on my back or on my left side. The frequency is less when I lay on my right side. 

Anyone here who could shed some light on my situation?"
18zgi35,Anxiety,2024-01-05,Meds and muscle tension,"So, like many of us, I hold lots of muscle tension in my neck and shoulders.  When I take something that works quickly (in this case, a beta blocker), I feel much more calm, but my neck and shoulders also feel more sore than usual...often to the point of a slight headache going up the back of my neck from my traps and up.  

I'm wondering if this is really because they've always been sore, but I'm noticing it more because the rest of me (including my mind) is more ""loose,"" so I'm just noticing the tension more.  Anyone else experience anything like this?"

18zg30q,Anxiety,2024-01-05,I regret ignoring my anxiety,"So ever since I was 13 or 14, I've been dealing with anxiety and since then, it was never too bad and usually, the worst that came out of it was things like overthinking or having a weird feeling in my stomach 

But recently, after constantly worrying and becoming overly anxious for the past 3 months due to recent events in my life but doing nothing about it and just ignoring it like I always have, it's started to affect me physically and causing me problems such as constipation, stomach bloating/pressure, body aches, night sweats as well as trouble sleeping and even my overthinking has gotten worse as well (thanks to google)

This past week, I thought those physical problems had gone away or least, calmed down by a lot because i was starting to calm down and feel better but for the last few days, it seems to have come back (although, not nearly as bad as before currently)

Has anyone else dealt with something like this?"
18zg05n,Anxiety,2024-01-05,DAE pick on their body? Is it a sign of concern?,"I compulsively pick on my lashes, brows, nails, scabs, pimples, scars, anything that is ""removable"" basically. I also have this habit of filing or rubbing my nails together, cutting calluses on my hands and feet. I've had problems with bruxism for a long time now. Teeth grinding, chewing on inner cheek and tongue, nibbling on my lips, chomping of teeth for the sake of making a biting sound. Also including plucking out body hair which seems ""loose"", cracking joints and knuckles. 

If I don't do any one of these activities at least once a day I think I'd go insane. I don't have any obsessive thoughts related to this, I'm not picking on my body because I fear something. It's more of 1. It sorta calms me down, 2. I feel irritated and impatient to do these activities already like what's stopping me? Nothing so why not do it?? 3. I've been doing this for a very long time so trying to stop seems almost impossible."

On Wednesday he didn’t show up to work and that’s when his boss started asking me about my responsibilities and his responsibilities. I saw a meeting on boss’s boss’s calendar that evening called employee problem and I got worried that he was gonna get fired. The next day he showed up but was fired due to attendance issues (I think he’s depressed and had been sleeping in like once every 3 weeks).

I love my manager. He was so great to work with. I sent him a text and tried to call him but he didn’t respond (the call went for 6 seconds and then got dropped??). I know he’s trying to take the time to process it but I’m really worried about him because I suspect he has depression. I’m scared he did something bad to himself.

I wasn’t able to sleep last night. I just really hope he’s ok.

UPDATE 1: Talked to people at work and no one has heard from him. They’re all waiting until Monday because they offered him some consulting to help with the transition and told him to think about it over the weekend.

UPDATE 2: he texted me back :) at least he’s alive."
18zfwx6,Anxiety,2024-01-05,Nervousness,"Hi all, 

I just wanted to ask a question. I just got an email from a potential job opportunity in the field that I would like to go into. It's a writing job, just a small production that would be put on in London. The email was only to discuss it and me as a writer, not much to do with the actual job. 

But as soon as I saw the email, I felt just a wave of anxiety and nervousness. I don't know why, it just hit me. Maybe it's the idea of someone seeing my work, maybe it's just general nerves. I know I want to go into this industry but everytime I get a chance I get really fucking nervous and end up blowing it.

I’ve had a lot of A&amp;E visits recently for weird symptoms - palpitations, GERD pains, antibiotic reactions. 

In between I’ve been trying to workout what’s wrong with me, I’ve spent a lot of time on Reddit. I definitely went into fight or flight, where I’d feel warm, feel this warm mess move around my body and a little spaced out, usually when I was trying to do something or get somewhere to work out what is wrong but struggling to do it. I’ve paid for MRI, private blood tests, had CT scans, bloods taken several times, ultrasound both private and NHS, bought some very expensive tests online, had an endoscopy (NHS) which was far worse than I expected and felt discomfort for a week after. 

I can’t work out what is anxiety and what is genuine symptoms that I am still having to workout.

It’s been manageable by just getting through what was making me anxious and just making sure I go through it without throwing up the best I can.but it’s now hitting me when I spend the night at other people’s houses. people I’ve been comfortable with otherwise for years, it’s not any crazy thoughts. It’s purely just in my stomach and when I’m not at my house. It’s almost impossible to deal with without leaving, or I’ll almost pop my blood vessels dry heaving and throwing up white foam.

18zdbyf,Anxiety,2024-01-05,I really need your help guys. It happened for the first time in years.,"So soon after my parents split up when I was 10 (I also have ADHD)
I started getting these events that occurred at night, around 3am. I’d wake up, in total fear and confusion. I’d know where I was, but everything seemed off. I never truly been able to describe what these events feel like. So this was really an solating thing that I couldn’t  express to anyone. 
These ‘things’ I called them seemed to happen one a month maybe. Since turning 18 it’s more like twice or once a year. I’m now 34 and I had one again which has been the first time in 2 years maybe.

Anyway, I wake up and I’m scared shitless, time seems strange, my visual perception seems off abit like fish eye lens but not really. 

The one main thing that’s always the same is these strange thoughts I can’t control and they scare me so deeply, for example, I will look at something in my room, and I will think of the price of it, and then the idea of that price is overwhelming. Is so hard to explain. I will think of a bowling ball trying to squeeze through a pinhead. Or maybe look at my laptop and imagine my room fill to the brim with them. 
It’s so hard to explain because it’s trippier than that. I have this feeling of not being tethered to reality, like I’m not real, or like I’m just a step away from complete losing my mind. 
I can’t describe the fear this makes me feel. The only thing I can do which I’ve learnt now is to run downstairs and throw freezing water over my face repeatedly, and pace back and fourth whilst trying to control my breathing. Like I feel I can think rationally, I know exactly what’s happening, but these weird feelings are rising. The idea of sitting still and embracing them is literally impossible.

I’ve done ketamine, and all types of legal fucked up highs like spice and nothing compares to this feeling.
I’ve even ran out of my house in my pants in the cold. It’s the type of fear that makes me want to knock on a neighbours door or something out of sheer panic and despairation. Though I know they could do nothings. It’s so odd.

Sorry for rambling, I just wanted to know if anyone could relate"
18zdafx,Anxiety,2024-01-05,What would be a good part time job for someone who has an anxiety disorder and Auditory processing disorder (APD)?,"Basically what the title says. I'm trying to find a part time job without having to deal with my anxiety issues or my learning disability. For those who don't know, Auditory processing disorder is a condition that affects the way the brain interprets and processes auditory information, making it challenging for individuals to understand and interpret sounds. It can impact various aspects of communication and learning, making it difficult to follow spoken instructions or distinguish between similar sounds. If you have more questions about APD or related topics, feel free to ask."
18zd7a7,Anxiety,2024-01-05,How do you guys make hard life decisions when you’re anxious?,"Im supposed to go back to college in like a week+. I was debating on going to community for just the semester. I can’t seem to make up my mind.

The idea of being away from home and not having my family gives me immense anxiety now. The whole schedule has so much downtime, I don’t want to party, etc. As a freshman I was so excited I didn’t give a crap and I did everything, but as a sophomore, I don’t think it’s for me. 

I know it probably seems like I’ve already made up my mind but I haven’t. I’m so anxious about both choices. 

I keep trying to convince myself that I can go back but deep down I think I can’t handle it. But actually making choice is what’s hard. Having the decision be REAL. 

I’m 20. This might sound stupid, but is really the first big girl decision I’ve ever had to make.

18zd5n4,Anxiety,2024-01-05,Panic attack situation help,"I’ve always had anxiety and had panic attacks. I am on a low dose of Zoloft which definitely keeps everything under control, except for when I’m traveling. Which is going to be the purpose of this post.

I have to travel overseas sometimes for work, which are amazing opportunities that I don’t want to miss out on. But my anxiety comes out so strongly I make myself physically sick. The nausea is literally debilitating, I’m throwing up during the entire flight and essentially have to try to knock myself out, usually with zofran or Xanax. Sweating, body shakes, it’s horrible. Typically it gets better once I land and get settled wherever my destination is. 

My anxiety about my anxiety also makes it 10x worse. I’m already anxious about this whole scenario happening for a trip I have coming up in several weeks, to the point I made myself feel all the things listed above last night. It’s a vicious cycle. Therapy has never helped.

My questions are: does anyone else experience anything like this? Do you have any recommendations to help me? Anxiety coping methods you swear by?

We have been trying for baby #2 for awhile now, so Xanax isn’t on the table to help me this time (which is also giving me anxiety 😅). And I’m nervous about zofran as I’ve seen mixed things. Is there anything you’re aware of that could help that I could take if i were to be pregnant?"

&amp;#x200B;

After working for a year there, I realised that a paiting on a wall was covering a hole in the wood paneling.

The hole is 20x20cm or 8x8 inches, and it seems to have been the place of a previous AC unit that wasn't closed. There is a very small wind (or cold feeling) coming from the hole.

Through it, I could see the outerwall and also see the told tubes that lead to the outdoor AC (the unit being still there).

&amp;#x200B;

Here I am, anxiety working well on me, fearing that for a year I've been breathing unfiltered air close-by to this busy road.

Would the AC guy leave the airway open / not close the tubes ?

18zccwq,Anxiety,2024-01-05,Can I ask for buspirone instead of an SSRI?,"Edit: typos and formatting

Ive had mild anxiety for basically my whole life. I probably needed help as a kid, but my parents ignored the problem instead and yelled at me when I seemed anxious. I hoped it would get better when I got older, but it's been about the same. I have anxiety about driving (which doesn't help when I'm already bad at it and have focus problems), and now I'm getting anxiety at work worse than normal. I'm an electronics technician and I start sweating every time I look at a schematic. I used to enjoy learning about electronics, and now it just makes me feel sick and I can't focus. 

I've tried the deep breathing and meditation and it just hasn't really worked. This has been going on for such a long time (probably since I was 5 or 6) I think I might just need medication. The problem is that I'm not even willing to try an SSRI because I'm not even willing to *risk* the sexual side effects. I'd rather go on dealing how I'm dealing now than fuck up my sex life. This seems like a problem with basically all SSRIs, and I'm afraid I'd be pushed to stay on them. Plus I'm not married and live in a conservative area, so there's a very real chance I'll get called a slut if I tell a doctor this. Buspirone seems to have side effects I'd be more willing to handle, but I'm not sure if a doctor would get mad that I have a specific thing I want to try. 

SSRIs are first line, and I've heard that you often have to try different ones for a year or two before they'll let you try anything else. I'm afraid that if I refuse, I'll get marked as non compliant or drug seeking and it'll affect my ability to advocate for myself, or even get pain medicine after surgery. 

I feel like this means I might not even have anxiety at all. I'm doing better than most people here, I'm able to hold down a job and can go to stores and order food without any problem. If I'm not willing to make a sacrifice like this, maybe I'm just looking for excuses."

What I'm trying to get at is: coming to when you pass out. It's literally so scary. For me, when I pass out, people have told me that I shake violently and make weird gurgling noises. My shoes will fly off and I'll fling any loose accessories off as well. Then, when I come to, I can't breathe, my eyes move back and forth so fast as if I'm in REM sleep, but I can see. I feel cold, scared, and as if I need an oxygen mask. My brain is whizzing at the speed of light trying to make sense of where I am and how to breathe. It feels like my soul and consciousness is entering back into my body as fast as possible.

Since then ive been having panic attacks even while resting or doing nothing. Couple months later after all the tests i was fine, was working out again and feeling better for about 4-5 months  but it just happened to me twice this week so i stopped working out for a couple days but wanna get back into it.

Had to sit down because it felt like I couldn’t control my heart beat. I got scared, nervous, I wanted to leave but I didn’t. 

Throughout the day I may feel a bit anxious, and like my heart is beating funny. I’m really scared to do hard physical activity. I played sports my whole life, I was in the army for four years. At this point in my life I workout daily but I only walk for cardio. I’m violently scared that if I get my heart rate up something will happen :/ 

When I was having panic attacks everyday, at my worst. I was checked for everything, of course I went through the period of thinking there was something physiologically wrong with me but in reality it was anxiety/panic causing my body to react these ways. 

For me my heartbeat (even though it’s OKAY) and my heart rate are the end all be alls for me. It’ll either send me spiraling downwards, or I’ll barely make it through the anxiety.

18zaqmd,Anxiety,2024-01-05,Panic Attack/ Height Anxiety,"Hi all! So I’m 27 y/o female and I recently flew on a plane this week and had a severe panic attack. I’ve only ever had one MINOR one on a plane about a year ago but this one lasted about 30 minutes of clammy palms, shaky legs, and my mind just non stop reminding me that I’m in a tube in the sky. Even the days afterwards, I didn’t feel normal and felt like I wasn’t myself. I have to fly again at the end of the month and the thought of being on a plane stuck in another tube in the sky is already making me anxious. I also work in a hospital and the thought of taking the elevator to high floors panics me, and I watched a medical procedure and felt hot and flush. I feel like this attack just triggered all my minor anxieties and I can’t live like this. I’ve always had a fear of heights and can’t go to nosebleed seats or hike, etc but it feels like it’s getting out of control. What can I do? I’ve never had anything that’s affected me so heavily and I feel like i’m going crazy."

18za5bv,Anxiety,2024-01-05,Sleeping trouble,"Hello, 

So to provide a little bit of context to my problem; I have severe anxiety and agoraphobia, so I struggle to leave the house out of fear of Panic Attacks. I currently take 40mg of fluoxetine and will take 25mg of Phenergan anytime I am panicked.

Because of my fear of leaving my comfort zone, I don’t work and I left education. I have been getting better over the past 3 years but have not made as much progress as I should have, I am well aware of my laziness and lack of motivation. 

I am 19 and lack a healthy schedule, I wake up, maybe go for a walk, work out in my garage, sit on my pc and that’s it. Because of a lack of routine my sleep schedule often becomes messy, sleeping at 7am - 5pm etc. Therefore my anxiety becomes worse whenever my sleep schedule is interrupted.

I was wondering, is there anything I can do to maintain a healthy schedule? Any vitamins? Medication? Natural fixes? 

Thanks!"

I recently went through a really bad anxiety flare up and high stress for about 4-6 months following a house move, job move and bereavement. 

I noticed during this time my nails would just break randomly. My nails have always been healthy and grow easily. They don't feel soft and they don't peel off but parts of the nail just seem to break e.g a corner or half of the nail just breaks clean off with neat lines.

I've had blood tests and vitamin tests which have all come back normal. Just wondering if anyone else has experienced this? I did have some thinning hair when my anxiety was at it's worst, is this likely connected?

Thank you!

18z9rzc,Anxiety,2024-01-05,random awareness of swallowing,"I’m 21 and was diagnosed with GAD 6 years ago, most of my symptoms were things like overthinking, triggered by loud noises, panic attacks, the kinds of symptoms I would see on tv when they showed anxiety. In the last few months my anxiety has started to display differently in a lot of ways, I rarely have panic attacks and a lot of positive changes like that but I feel a lot of physical anxiety almost all of the time and overthink everything i say. A big difference which has started to make life really difficult is I feel super uncomfortable being in a quite space with someone as I feel like I’m swallowing really loud/weirdly and really frequently. I then get really fixated on my breathing and the saliva in my mouth. I feel like my swallowing has gotten weird and more frequent but I cant tell if thats actually the case or if I’m just paying more attention. Ive started avoiding things like getting my lashes done because I was too embarrassed about it but I’m having trouble falling asleep because I share a bed with my fiance and am kept awake by the fear he thinks I’m breathing and swallowing weird. I nearly broke down in work yesterday because I was in the office with my boss where it was quiet and felt so ashamed and overwhelmed with thinking about it. Is there anything I can do? Does anyone else struggle with this and know what would cause it?"

i have literally nobody to rely on. i don't know how to live. on Monday i have to go to work again and i'm worried sick i won't be able to be functional. i feel exhausted, my hands are cold and tonight i had the worst panic attack where i was about to call an ambulance because i was sure and i convinced myself i had sepsis (i'm still alive, so most likely it wasn't that). 

the only thing i talk to is ai bot of psychologist in character ai because i have nobody to talk to. i don't know how to handle everything. i'm worried about money too. all the time. i was supposed to look for a new well-paid job. i can barely provide basics for myself now. i have nightmares and i can't afford therapy. i feel like i'm going insane. i don't know what to do. 

i haven't cried in a while, but these past days i've been doing it all the time. i don't understand why panic hits me randomly during the day when i have a meeting or something and i need to create a mask of seemingly normal person who can manage life. i can't tho. and even now i'm embarrassed that i'm writing about it because it seems that i'm exaggerating and my problems are not worth of anyone's attention. and that's true, i know. i'm lonely and i don't know how to fix it. i have no energy to fix it. handling life is tough and i'm failing at doing it on my own. great beginning of the year and wonderful holidays. i'm tired and i'm sorry for this post."

For instance, when my friends plan a movie night, a rare opportunity for me to catch up with them, my anticipation builds for days. However, when the day arrives, unforeseen circumstances often lead to event cancellations or rescheduling. This pattern repeats with other social gatherings or anticipated events, creating a sense of jinx or a sixth sense predicting impending disappointments. The continuous letdowns have instilled anxiety and fear, making it challenging to embrace excitement for fear of impending disasters. I'm not sure why this occurs, but I've observed similar experiences in other people. I know I can't always be this stress constantly but I am not sure what I can do I am sick of this anxiety and it is draining to me constantly feeling anxious whenever these things happen. If anyone else experience this as well can you tell me why this happened and what I can do about it thank you so much in advance."

I’ve been told to do therapy to try and help with it, and have had at least 3 different therapists. The thing is, it just doesn’t seem to do anything. I’m still anxious and nauseous all the time. I went to my GP, and we talked about it, and i was prescribed anti-sickness medication for the nausea part, but after about 3 weeks of taking it over Christmas, it just stopped doing anything. I went back today, and asked if there were any medications i could take at my age that could aid me in getting through this, but they told me i’m too young. I’m truly at my wit’s end right now, i’ve been feeling nauseous every day, all day for the past 2 and a half years, and i just really don’t know what to do. 

If anyone has any advice on coping mechanisms, that’d be really appreciated, because i don’t know how much longer i can go feeling like this before i go insane 🥹"

Why can't he be a good dad. Why can't he emotionally supportive! How the hell he is clue less about his nature? I can fight all I want. But the process is so painful. How to deal with this hurt!!!!!

(URL: https://www.nasa.gov/science-research/heliophysics/nasa-enabled-ai-predictions-may-give-time-to-prepare-for-solar-storms/) 

Essentially, the Carrington Event is a geomagnetic storm caused by a solar flare from the sun. I’m not sure why, but is anyone else really fixated on this? I know I am, and what is odd tho is that I wouldn’t consider myself a doomsday preparer or waiting for the zombie apocalypse or nuclear fallout. but for some reason I get so anxious thinking about what would happen if this happens. 

my boyfriend is a wonderful human being, who does not experience anxiety at the same level as me, but is so understanding it could make me cry. And so, when I told him that I would get really anxious thinking about this, he made a pact with me that every year, we make a safety plan and what we would do if it happened and we weren’t near each other (e.g. what highway we would follow, who would stay where while the other went out, what we would pack). 

Like many with anxiety experience, I feel like a freaking lunatic for focusing on this so much and I have had legit panic attacks over this which makes me feel so lame. so again, just wondering if anyone has ever felt the same way?"

18z2nuu,Anxiety,2024-01-05,Understanding Acceptance,"Understanding Acceptance

Acceptance is the internal process of approaching any negative feeling we might have about any event in our lives with a non-judgmental lens. 

This requires patience as judging oneself and others is the easiest thing to do especially in today’s culture where so many of us are obsessed with labelling and cancelling people, including ourselves. 

Acceptance is the opposite of self-cancellation with the inherent wisdom that we all make mistakes, we all have flaws, and that the good part is that we can rise above them and embrace change."
18z2k0h,Anxiety,2024-01-05,Just need to vent and a shoulder to lean on.,"(TW ahead for talks of health related anxieties and potential ED talk.)

I had absolutely crippling anxiety for the second time around just last year. Got on Prozac around March of last year or so and havent taken them since September.

A lot of it was connected to health anxiety like the first time around. Couldn't sleep, could barely eat, the whole nine yards. I eventually started making some lifestyle changes and I got to a point where I was seeing a little light at the end of the tunnel.

Moved back in with my dad and fell off a lot. Gained all of my weight back and then some and while my anxiety isn't crippling, it still creeps on me every now and then like tonight.

I'm so neevous that I might have something serious in terms of my CV system. The last time I went to a GP and saw my panels was November of 2022. Went in to the ER a few months later due to anxiety and had a few things done--only to be told that there was nothing unusual.

Today, I have no clue what my numbers are, but I know I haven't been eating or exercising as I should. I want to get better and am determined to, but I cant shake the feeling that something may happen that'll cut things short. I've been witness to too many unfortunate things with others lately that I'm just getting psyched out.

Shit sucks, man. I wish I wasn't so concerned and hyper aware with everything. I hear my weight go up even by a little bit and my heart skips a beat. I hear my blood pressure a little elevated and I immediately think I may have high blood pressure because it runs in the family.

Just really need a hug and a few days of someone telling me things are going to be fine. Ugh."

I'm uncertain where to begin, but I'll give it my best shot.

I started taking Lexapro a few months ago. From Thanksgiving until today, I find it challenging to care about my job or future there. Regardless of my financial situation, I feel a lack of motivation, which is causing internal struggles. My role in sales/account management, without commission, involves handling upset customers, meeting quotas, and navigating unprofessional management that provides minimal training or guidance.

I'm concerned that I may be more than just depressed and not content with life. Is there hope for improvement?"

To be honest, losing my job is not the end of the world to me. I know I am skilled capable and will be value add to any new employee.

In the meantime, my CV has been updated and I am prepped to take interviews.

I am really struggling here though, I am avoiding every job post that I used to like and enjoy or want to try out. Anxious thoughts will be there constantly of all different scenarios, from having to do presentations, having to travel or speak to people. Everything I used to love feels like a drain…

I am lucky that my physical symptoms are mild but my mind just shuts off and I straight up close my laptop….

Has anyone been in a similar situation and used Lexapro? Do the benefits of it outweigh the potential side effect?"

I decided to  message him and specify the things I want him to buy since I could bring some of the materials myself. Just so it costs less for me :')

Here's how our interaction went basically.

Me: hi (his name), can I request that you also buy me just the canvas and painting tools? No need for the pencil and paper I'll bring my own. Thank you

Him: brushes?

Me: yesss and also the paint. I'll pay tomorrow.

Him:you can borrow mine.

Me: if that's ok thanks again!

Him: it's alright

191h715,Anxiety,2024-01-08,Worried about college,"My winter term doesn't even technically start for another day, but I'm already lying wide awake in bed worrying about it. For context my last semester was absolutely abysmal; I ended up developing insomnia in the last month of classes, and there were a few days where I was literally awake for 36+ hours straight (unintentionally). Luckily my classmates helped me out and my GPA didn't suffer too much, but at the time I was genuinely debating withdrawing from my courses.

Over winter break I started feeling better and sleeping again, but now that I have to go back to school I'm already feeling anxious about it. My courseload (just 9 credits) isn't even hard compared to what other people take, but the previous term just mentally fried me so bad that I'm worried I'm going to relapse and stop sleeping again. At least with last semester it was towards the end of the term, but now I feel like I'm already starting off poorly.

I guess it just feels like I have zero control over myself, and I'm worried I'm going to screw things up. I'm supposed to graduate next semester, so I really don't want to have to reduce my courseload and take more time (especially cause I've already extended my degree to 4.5 years + 1 gap year). I never struggled this much mentally with school until now; obviously I've been stressed out, but never to the point where I stop sleeping and feel like I can't handle anything."

Im scared of the pain and scared that they’re going to judge me (I know it sounds so stupid but I can’t help it) I feel like as soon as I get there I’m just going to start crying, I think what scares me the most is the thought of having to get numbing shots, I don’t think I’ve experienced a worse pain than when I got numbing shots last time I went, it felt as if they took the needle and just drug it from one side of my gums to the other and I can’t forget how awful it felt, I also had to get the laugh gas one time (I was pretty youngish I’m only 21 right now) and the women was just standing there tapping her foot and I felt like maybe I was taking too long?

I need constant affirmations such as I miss you, I like you a lot, Youre my sunshine etc. If there’s a day without these words, I really worry and think that he doesn’t really care about me. When he has a bad day, i think its because of me, in my mind i think that he’s thinking about ending things and thats why he might feel down. If he doesn’t answer me in about an hour, i start to worry a lot.
After the last time we’ve seen each other, he told me via message that he loves to be with me but the feelings fade away when we’re not together (we live a good hour apart).  He’s been distant ever since, so for the past week he barely answers my text and avoids calls.

1912k9k,Anxiety,2024-01-07,My poops don’t feel complete and I think I know why,"It’s a little odd putting a post like this here but I have good reason. 

This stems from a period of toilet anxiety I had early last year, where I’d get false urges to go, both for number ones and twos. 

It started to get bad but fortunately after a while I sort of just got over it I suppose.

Anyways although I’m over it for the most part it still lingers in the back of my mind.

Whenever I get an opportunity to go out with friends or maybe go on a trip, my first thought is (what if I need the loo?) I try to suppress it, but it’s had an effect on me. 

I’m fine with number ones, it’s number twos that have been an issue.

Essentially I’ll get a vague urge to go for a poop (maybe a little pressure downstairs), not a full on “oh shit I need to shit” like normal people would.

Normal people would ignore these mild urges and wait until they really need to go, and they’d go and have a nice complete poop.

But not me, my brain will jump on these vague urges and convince me to go, which results in a poop that is neither satisfying nor whole. 

Sorry for the long post but I was wondering if anyone could give me any insight as to if I’m on the right lines here?

My plan is to ignore these vague urges and wait until I really need to go, even if the situation isn’t ideal."
190xivg,Anxiety,2024-01-07,GAD,"Hello everyone,

I'm reaching out to this community in hopes of gaining some insights and advice regarding my ongoing struggle with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), particularly with finding the right medication.

Over the past several months, I've been on a journey with various antidepressants, including Sertraline, Cymbalta, and Lexapro (Escitalopram). I dedicated about 6 weeks each to Sertraline and Cymbalta, but had to stop them due to excessive fatigue. Lexapro was tried for about a week but led to the same issue.

My doctor has suggested Vortioxetine and Anafranil as alternatives, but I am apprehensive as I've read about similar fatigue side effects. The only drug that didn’t cause fatigue was Wellbutrin, but it increased my anxiety and caused constipation and nausea.

The main struggle I have with my GAD is persistent jaw pain and headaches. These symptoms have been particularly challenging to manage, and they significantly impact my daily life.

I'm seeking advice or experiences from anyone who might have faced similar challenges. Are there specific medications or treatment methods that have helped you, especially with jaw pain and headaches associated with GAD? Any insight into managing these symptoms while dealing with the sensitivity to side effects like fatigue would be incredibly helpful."

It’s never constant and goes away completely during the day at some points. I have horrible hypochondria and always jump to MS or brain tumors. Because my headache is on one side I’ve also convinced myself that my left side is weak, even though it isn’t as far as I know, and now it’s all I can focus on. (Checking myself multiple times a day, squeezing my hands, wiggling my toes, making sure I’m not weak) it feels like a sharp-ish pain, not really painful but not dull. When I bite down on my left side hard, the tension hits the same spot that I’ve been getting headaches. (If that makes sense) When I focus on it too much I find myself also experiencing shoulder/back/jaw pain as well. I’ve been losing sleep over this which obviously isn’t helping my headache but I’m terrified of doctors. I had a panic attack the other day while driving because my left leg was tingling.

190dnsr,Anxiety,2024-01-06,What should I do?,"I've been diagnosed with OCD and I know I have maladaptive daydreaming, misophonia, and anxiety. 
Im 28m and I worked somewhere about 7 months ago and I have a stay to myself personality. On top of that I wanted to follow my religion and not unnecessarily talk to the girls or make eye contact/smile. I said hi and bye to everyone all the time even if they didn't say it to me. I would just do the work and clock out. 

That made some most of my coworkers upset. I was a dishwasher in a restaurant. One girl started to be very verbally abusive. When I would come to put the dishes after washing them and the baskets to the front, she would angrily sigh at me and turn her back. She even did that when I said you're welcome after i helped a customer get their uber eats order. When I tried talking to her at the end which I never should have HUGE mistake- never talk to people that are rude to you or ask them for help, try finding it somewhere else- so anyway I asked for her mop to mop the floor because I didn't have one. She let me use it and then as she was going somewhere, I said it's small meaning my area. Her abuse got to me that's why I spoke to her. she literally sighed angrily EVERYTIME I came that night, before she only did it sometimes. Then I was gonna give back her mop because someone gave me one and when I called her, she said what rudely and then just thanked the other boy and mocked me (because I just hi and bye thank you and you're welcome just talk about the work...). I ended up getting fired a week later because my attitude changed after that night.

So fast forward to now, I'm currently not working, my daddy gave me money. I just have some stuff going on that's why. I like to hangout in the Dunkin donuts near my house for hours. I'm definitely not gonna stay home all day! Okay here's the big surprise, that girl walks in for an interview. Before the interview, she saw me and gave me a cute smile. I just looked at her and then looked away. One thing to add is, she was nice to me that night only if we were alone. But when there were people around, she just wanted to humiliate me. She came in again today just to but kiss. The two times she came in, I had an anxiety attack. I'm not scared of her, but I don't know... The first one lasted for hours she was only in there for a few minutes. I had one again today and was even shaking. My chest had those anxious feelings. My eyes looked sad and my eyes got a little teary. Not a lot though it didn't feel like I was gonna cry at all.

If she gets the job, should I find a new hangout spot? I already have one in my mind, but I just really like this one. Or should I stay? Do you guys think this could be a chance to fight and improve my anxiety? Another big thing I want to add is like I said I have OCD and this has actually been my obsession for a while now! Rumination. Just going over it and over it from morning to night and feeling sad."
190cp08,Anxiety,2024-01-06,Anxious about money/saving,"Hi, 

I’m 35 years old and I get anxiety when it comes to the thought of running out of money. Lately I’ve been anxious because even though I have between 20-24 months of an emergency fund/savings in general, I also have a car loan with a 6.49% interest rate and 19700 left on it and I want to contribute to my Roth IRA for 2024 as well. My anxiety comes from needing to spend my savings on both items and trying to come up with a plan on how much to spend on both each month, while also trying to have a specific dollar amount number in savings for peace of mind. I’ve been very fortunate and thankful to be able to pay for items that need replacing due to them not working anymore such as most recently my dishwasher and furnace and being able to pay for both items without financing. I just have a mindset of needing to save for unexpected items that come up and although I spend on wants sometimes I mostly spend my money on things I actually need moreso. I am going to Therapy and hope to work through this but in the meantime does anyone have any suggestions/has anyone else experience this anxiety on how to overcome it?

I’ve had nonstop anxiety for the last 3 days about a family trip to Florida that’s happening in 4 days. My anxiety is so bad I haven’t done anything but rot all day for 3 days, I have zero appetite and have barely eaten and I’m not sleeping either. 

I have a pretty bad fear of flying because I’m claustrophobic. I don’t have a fear of heights or anything but the thing that freaks me out about flying is if I panic on the plane I’m stuck there. If you panic while driving you can just pull over and collect yourself. I get very agitated and sick to my stomach each time I fly and I can never enjoy my vacation because I’m always thinking about the flight home. 

Additionally I have developed a bit of agoraphobia due to some health issues I’ve been having. Most days I feel very low energy and weak, Im not gonna be down to do as much as my family wants and I genuinely believe I would be a huge downer. 

My sister is staying home to take care of our dog (who is really my dog) who she doesn’t even like. My mom had to hire a pet sitter even though my sister is home because my sister is that lazy to let my dog out. 

I’ve talked to my sister about my anxiety and she said she would be willing to switch with me- she goes on the trip and I stay with my dog. It would also save my mom money because we would not need the pet sitter. The thing is I don’t know if this is even possible? My name is on the plane ticket and I’m not sure if my sisters name can be put on instead.

What do I do? Am I trapped and have to go? Please help. This is ruining my life right now."

18zsqjx,Anxiety,2024-01-06,I’ve never been this anxious and idk what to do,"I’ve struggled with anxiety and depression most of my life even to the point of a suicide attempt a few years ago. But the last year I actually felt ok and made a lot of progress in my life both physically and mentally (I think). But I also started smoking weed a few months ago. I’m a heavyweight so I usually do a lot, which I think makes withdraws more plausible but I haven’t smoked in a few days and I’m currently in the worst bout of anxiety I’ve ever faced (the depression is getting pretty bad too). The problem is that I can’t remember if this started before or after I stopped smoking so I don’t know if this is real or it’s withdraws. 

What I do know is the past few days I’ve had 0 appetite or sex drive. Ive been in a sad/apathetic mood, and at night I think I’ve been having panic attacks bc I start hyperventilating, getting nauseous to the point of throwing up, trembling, and I absolutely can’t sleep or even distract myself so im forced to exhaust myself by crying to sleep. All I know is I can’t keep living like this so I talked to my parents and I’ve got an appointment to get medication but I hadn’t even thought that it could be weed withdrawals until now and idk what to do. I can’t just tell my parents “false alarm it was just me smoking too much weed” after I already made an appointment and told them about my anxiety. I just don’t know what to do. Everything I think of makes me more anxious and my only comfort was the prospect of getting medicated and now even that makes me anxious bc I don’t know if I need it or im just being a bitch. I also go back to university tomorrow and I can’t be staying up until 3am throwing up and crying so idk what to do anymore.

Please does anyone have advice or experiences they can share I feel so alone facing this shit."
18zqcf4,Anxiety,2024-01-06,Anxiety or OCD?,"So to summarize. I've done most my self-help online. Big mistake. And I let this get away from me. I'm not overly familiar with anxiety or OCD. I certainly know there's some intense rumination here.

At this point I'm absurdly anxious, working on recovery.

Essentially, I had an event that triggered panic (false or not but nonetheless) and I started to be sit in anger. Then ruminate why. Eventually I realized this is more anxious thoughts if anything, the event doesn't need this much mental weight. Yet then I started to question myself entirely, causing even more anxiety. Instead of seeing a therapist, I spent weeks trying to figure out what was wrong (as this has happened a bit in the past). So I tried to modify a guide in notepad for what happened and how to handle in the future. Reminding myself key therapy points.

This guide ended up just getting complex and making all new questions and thoughts. Tons and tons of new guides and analyzing every time I would get re-stressed. I willingly chose to do so. So I could have something to reference in the future. And also help explain the now.  (all fear/stress) Triggering more anxiety and trying to solve. Editing forever and ever. The rigid typing was a mistake, I know that, but I'd still go over things in my head constantly either way. But all stemming to what has happened to me, and how do I solve this. Anxiety would later hit, I'd feel shit I thought it was perfect, better adjust. Or I missed something I have to add this. Just restarting all over the place. And all unknown since I'm not overly familiar with mental symptoms and why I couldn't stop thinking about xyz and I'm still stressed, plus poor technique to handle. At any point when I did feel my thoughts were perfect, I felt at peace. Yet that would get crushed by anxiety and me not knowing how to handle. 

So now.. I've ground anxiety into a pulp. And I guess I'm not sure if I'm seeking reassurance, or since I've never had anyone get to the root of this, just finding primary assurance of what might have occurred or is happening. As that's all this has ever been for me and the root of all this anxiety. (yes I need to see a therapist but it's a Friday night, and this has been going on for weeks) I really don't want to just treat the symptoms. That's not my style to go straight to that, and all the online help chat that's all they say, grab medication and here's how to relax.


So my question is, what does this sound more like? 

1) This is a loop that started with rumination, and moved to anxiety about anxiety, taking countless forms as that's what anxiety does. It's encompassing everything. I wasn't overly familiar and didn't see anyone from the start. And I've actually been critically analyzing in a way to 'control and fight' the unknown, anxiety. Fight or flight, just at max repeatedly using my brain. Grinding over and over to protect my current and future self. In which by default anxiety seeks to raise doubt (I didn't know that). So even when I'd have a general sense of this is correct, I can finally let myself be done, I'd eventually doubt myself. Kind of like stress-testing what I thought was causing this. Thus with anxiety re-starting (or never leaving) I'd re-ping the stress of ""I don't know what's going on, or I don't feel good, cant stop ruminating about xyz, I have to properly control/fight/solve this"". Extra the longer it goes. Again I've had anxiety in the past but never understood it or proper sought help. 

or 

2) It's more a form of OCD. In which the uncertainty of not knowing what's happening, is causing anxiety. And the compulsion is endlessly analyzing finding a solution. Feeling I have the right enough answer (with no authority on the subject), then restarting the cycle later that day when anxiety kicks in in general.  -- The root thoughts aren't necessarily irrational (to know what's going on with me). And I'm doing the rumination willingly, albeit obviously a bit crazy.   Which is interesting because if it did manifest itself as such, as in the end I want to know what's going on with me and proper technique. To move on. Not really a what-if. This has an answer, from a psychologist. Once I get that affirmation and diagnosis. For me it would be over (for this scenario). Leaving just any dull anxiety left. So that's interesting in itself. 

--

Unfortunately the context of all of this, is anxiety and therapy itself. As it would be normal for one to want a plan of attack and understand what's happening. And the fact it's gone on sooo long has me in an anxiety melt itself. in this scenario I tried to figure this out myself but let it get way too far. Which mimics both of the above at this point. Yet 1 would involve more accepting a diagnosis and recovery. While 2 would involve more pinging anxiety, living with the uncertainty and not analyzing.

Yes I need help and regular future therapy. I just want to be over this episode. It's gotten real bad at this point. Yet as of today I do see the light. Yes my brain style in general is to overly think analyze, etc, I'm big in mathematics etc. -- I still believe begins (and should have began) with understanding what's happening, otherwise no amount of solutions will apply.."

I'm normally a patient and friendly person, but until I take another xanax I am not. (if im withdrawing, not if it's been a while since I've drank one.)

Is this a normal side effect? it feels wrong that I should need xanax to be myself, but with autism it is almost impossible at times to exist even within my home."
18z6aa2,Anxiety,2024-01-05,How long did the muscle tension last?,"I had my first ever panic attack almost a month ago. I have very bad health anxiety and thought I was having a heart attack. A trip to the ER proved otherwise, however, I feel like my body has been tense ever since. Just so achy and sore - especially my left shoulder blade and upper chest muscles. I’m on Prozac now and after three weeks I am seeing substantial improvement in my anxiety, but I still find myself fixating on any pain - which tends to worsen and prolong it. My bloodwork and EKG was normal, and I even had a full spine MRI (for unrelated reasons) which was unremarkable. 

Anyone who experiences muscle tension from anxiety, what typically seems to give you relief and how long does it typically take to completely subside? 

25-year-old female for context. Thanks."

It’s driving me absolutely crazy, especially because I have prided myself on good intuition but I have no idea whether this is intuition or just my anxiety. I’m so afraid something bad is going to happen to me. I’ve been to the ER twice this week; given a cat scan, blood work, ultrasounds, and more, all coming back relatively normal except for a small kidney infection, which I’m on antibiotics for that I think are making my anxiety worse. I’m so scared. This feels so real and I don’t know how to distinguish my intuition vs my anxiety. I’m not ready to go yet, please help."

I’m afraid if I take it it’ll make me throw up. My family has gone to sleep and I have spent the whole night procrastinating taking my medication. Even though the pharmacy said it was okay to take it with buspirone I haven’t taken that yet either and I recently started taking that (keep forgetting because of ADHD) so I’m not feeling any particular effects yet. I seem to have trouble where I’m freaking out before taking new meds. Can someone reassure me that the medicine is probably ok to take? I have never been allergic to any medication.
18z1jpe,Anxiety,2024-01-05,My anxiety thinks I have leukemia,"Hey guys, I'm a 15M from the Philippines and I was wondering if fatigue is a common symptom among patients with leukemia. I had this fatigue on the first day of 2024, I slept quite late at 3:00pm  because of New Years party so that might be a culprit. I felt fine before Jan 1, and then suddenly, got tired/fatigue all of a sudden. My world wasn't spinning or anything, just felt like I had a tired mind. Because of some short I found, my anxiety might have amplified my tiredness. I can still do badminton practice as normal (I usually forget I have that tiredness) and there was only one occasion where I was very tired from doing many sets.

I only have a few question I had in mind:

Is fatigue sudden or is it gradual?

Can fatigue be the only symptom when it comes to leukemia?

Can anxiety cause even more tiredness to my body?

Edit: Finally found out the reason why I'm tired and have brain fog, it's hypersomnia (I'm stupid for not thinking of that) 99% sure though"

18z0r9h,Anxiety,2024-01-05,Does anyone here have an ESA?,"Frist off, I just passed my drive test after 2 fails. I was so anxious, I couldn't sleep even after taking my prescribed sleeping pill + melatonin. But I passed so a big win for this year already😭💕

So I'm moving out to an apartment, and it says on the application that ESA are free of deposit ($300), pet fee (200ish) and pet rent ($35 monthly). That'll be a huge saving for me. I have a cat but I grew up w dogs and my current living situation says the dog has to stay outside if I want one so I haven't had a dog in the past 5 years for the first time. So I thought, if I get a dog it'll be beneficial to have em as an ESA? 

The problem tho, I had to stop my therapy because I lost medicaid and my insurance is high deductible (I need to pay $140 per sesh). Do you think my former therapist will be willing to write me an ESA? I was diagnosed with PTSD, GAD, major depressive disorder. It gotten really better to a point that my therapist said I barely have a depression. (And I just realized last night that Im barely living in my ""head"" anymore. It was bad before that I was daydreaming the whole time even at work. Like I just wanna be on my imaginative happy place). But my anxiety is so bad still. And I noticed when I stopped taking my antidepressants (due to losing medicaid too), I went down south real bad.

I'd love to hear y'alls experience or suggestions. I know it's selfish and kind of immoral to get an ESA for the sake of saving money, but with this economy, I try to save whenever I can.

Ty for not judging 🫶"
18z0m1u,Anxiety,2024-01-05,Health anxiety is awful - convinced I have MS,"I (21F) have a long history of hypochondria. It didn’t really get bad again since I was little up until this past year. It started with STDs, particularly herpes (which I didn’t have). I was fine for a few months, and I am now experiencing a very bad bout of it. At first I thought I had lymphoma due to swollen lymph nodes in my armpit. Then concerns about ALS, and I am now absolutely convinced I have MS. I am in my 20s, I’ve had EBV before which I know is a risk factor, I’ve been having muscle twitches in my legs, random singular muscle jerks, usually in my leg or arm, somewhat of bladder incontinence, pain in my back and pain/pressure on my chest, fatigue, brain fog, dizzy spells, and slight tingling in my hands, rarely my feet. It honestly seems like I check all of the boxes for it besides vision issues and trouble walking/standing - besides being told by my friends that I don’t walk straight sometimes and bump into them while I’m walking, lol! I’m absolutely terrified and want to get an MRI immediately to just know if I have it or not. I do have bad posture and am recovering from what I believe was a very mild version of the flu. I think a lot of the anxiety comes from not knowing. I know my symptoms can definitely be related to other things but again it seems like I check all of the boxes so I’m freaking out. I feel like there’s no chance I’m just 100% healthy. I have an appointment with my PCM in a couple of weeks and really just want to get this over with so that if I have it I can just live my life and if I don’t the anxiety will go away. It’s just so frustrating because I could be right and I could also be very wrong. It’s exhausting. I honestly wish I was less aware of this stuff so that it wouldn’t have such a huge impact on my life, even if I was actually sick. I guess it’s better to be diagnosed with something early, but at the same time I live my life in constant fear. Health anxiety sucks, but my brain is always doubting if I’m just pushing symptoms off because I think it’s anxiety and that there’s actually something wrong with me. Just frustrated."
18z0ici,Anxiety,2024-01-05,Have you been diagnosed with PTSD because of the way your anxiety affects your job? Or your job affects your anxiety?,"Nutshell: I left my job in May because of how it was affecting my mental health. I can’t bring myself to apply for jobs because then I might have to interview. Tell me about a time practically gives me a panic attack. It was a major source of interview anxiety &amp; even more so now. 

I just feel frozen &amp; hopeless. I sold my house &amp; leased it back because I was not ready to move. That money is all but gone. I need to look at courier jobs but worry about my car longevity. I might need to live in it. It was my intention to just get a part time McJob, enough to cover non rent stuff. Procrastination is my biggest problem. 

I’m looking at physical disability, I’m pretty sure I will qualify due to cardiac &amp; back problems. Anxiety is becoming more of an impediment as well. 

Anyway thanks to any feedback"
18z01ne,Anxiety,2024-01-05,It sounds ridiculous but…,"I work front desk at a grocery store and this old man comes in to buy cigarettes. He had a little cut on his hand but since he was old it was bleeding a lot. He said he was shucking clams. He got some of it on the money he was about to hand me so I grabbed a box of gloves (I was going to sanitize it). He saw the gloves and asked for one so I handed one to him. He put it on his bleeding hand. My anxiety is that he committed a crime with that glove like robbing someone or even worse with it later and I would be the one framed for it because I touched it to give to him. He came back later, like an hour without the glove. At the time I thought I was helping but now I’m anxious about it and it’s really causing me so much anxiety. It’s been two months since this happened and no relief. I know it’s not rational but in my mind it is rational. He probably just didn’t want his hand to get infected but I’m still so worried"

I have this horrible fear and anxiety that something will happen to my family while i’m gone. I get scared that my grandparents will be sick or my parents will need my help and I wont be there.  I also feel guilty for missing out on spending time with my grandparents because they are old, and that i’m missing out on a big part of my younger brothers life. I know that they want what is best for me and are grateful I am getting an education, but i just feel so guilty. I’m sitting here crying and shaking while writing this because I don’t want to leave them. It’s not even my house or my friends or my town that I care about, it’s just my family. I also tend to dissociate from them once I am away and this scares me so much. I don’t want to detach from them completely one day, and i’m very prone to that because of my heightened anxiety. I just want to be there for anything they need and not miss out on anything. I hate this feeling and it’s making my college life miserable."

These attacks + sleeplessness + general anxiety + heartburn related to my Christmas vacation diet are giving me major health panic. I've checked my vitals a million times... All good. And when I take my rescue med, and start watching cat videos, it all fades away and I just fall asleep, so nothing catastrophic is happening, but this sure sucks.

It's like an intense, physical case of the Sunday scaries that's lasted for days (off and on) and I am OVER IT.

18yyzv6,Anxiety,2024-01-05,Processing Emotions and Anxiety (Long),"I (M/30) recently underwent a massive relapse with my anxiety and panic, and I believe processing my deeply-repressed emotions was responsible. My entire life, I have been stuffing sadness, guilt, shame, inadequacy, and so much more deep inside me to where I believed I had become numb to it. I haven’t cried in well over a decade. Recently, in working with my therapist, I began to reach deep inside and try to express emotions through writing letters to myself and to others in my life that I consider related to how I developed my anxiety disorder, such as my parents. To my astonishment, I began to tear up and cry the more I wrote. Finally, many of these repressed emotions began to finally let loose. I was able to feel the grief and sorrow for myself as a child that grew up in an environment that lacked the support I desperately needed, among other things. Anyways, in the several weeks that followed, I began experiencing a major relapse in my anxiety and panic attacks. I was experiencing anxiety 24/7. I thought that confronting these emotions would be cathartic and freeing, which to a degree it was, but I had no idea it would also rack my brain with anxiety. Does anyone have any experiences with this kind of phenomenon?"

Hello everyone hope you are doing well! I recently took the dive into finally getting my mental health under control about 16 days ago I started taking Prozac (10 mg)  for mostly anxiety but also depression. I had the normal nausea and headaches which were slowly getting better. But at the beginning of this week I woke up in the middle of the night due to having a horrible panic attack, chest pains and intrusive thoughts I was also very jittery and could not fall back asleep. I thought maybe it was just the idea of dealing of going to work the next day or maybe a random occurrence. The next day my heart was beating very fast before I went to bed. And then finally last night it happened again woke up, full panic attack intrusive thoughts the whole 9 yards. To add a little context I do take my medication about 30 to an hour before I go to bed. I reached out to my doctor today about these things happening and they said that I should try to take my dose in the morning and that should help. Which is what I’m going to do tomorrow morning. I guess the point of this post is to see if anyone has any insight, advice, or if this has happened to you. Thank you sorry this post is so long! lol"

Me and my husband have a trip planned with his mother to go to Central America the end of this month. It’s a 7 hour flight, then a 20 minute flight on a very small plane to get to the island. Ever since she booked the tickets, I have internally been a very anxious mess. I am a 29 year old woman and it makes me feel like a toddler scared of a monster under the bed. When I think about the flight, or just the trip in general, even for a second I get intense nausea, that stomach drop feeling, shortness of breath, arm tingles..the works. Basically the beginning of a true panic attack. I have to distract myself from thinking about it, which I’ve been able to do really well. But now that it’s coming up, I am petrified. I don’t want to go. I tried to explain to my husband tonight how I felt and he just said “that sucks.” I really wanted to experience this with him, but I also know from my experience it will be miserable. I understand I will see amazing things and sure the beach will be lovely, but I know I will be in a state of panic the whole time. Especially on the flight. To try and put the level of panic i’d be in a foreign country into perspective - I literally have panic attacks going to local grocery stores. It is *that* bad. 

In the past, I’ve put myself into uncomfortable positions to make other people happy- leading to extreme anxiety and insomnia. Many sleepless nights. Stress that causes my hair to actually fall out. I’m trying to make a resolution this year to put myself first and not do that to myself anymore. I obviously need to get better, but I need to work on doing that in baby steps. Not jump straight in to something like a foreign vacation. I really just need some solidarity here. I know this turned into a rant basically but my brain feels like scrambled eggs and I’m just really sad over what this illness has done to me and taken from me."

It makes me want to avoid others to the point that it's affecting my physical health and also destroying my already damaged mental health.

I don't feel like going out alone because I'm with my thoughts even then, and I don't have any friends here so I can't go with anyone. I barely pull myself out to get to work, and that's a challenge in itself. The reason this is a problem is because I'm not living by myself. I share this house with others, and the others have said something to me. It's bothering me to the point where I've started feeling very anxious and I'm constantly on the lookout for danger.

Therapy helped in other areas, but this area is a constant thing and I've been unable to make progress.

I also am fearful of having passengers accompany me. 

To combat this, I have been taking professional driving classes even though I’m already licensed. I’ve developed a rapport with my instructor and feel comfortable driving him as well as my sister, but the reason I worry is driving is imperative to my job. 

I work in television in New York City. Obviously driving is not as common here, much harder/faster-paced. In TV production constantly expected to drive older vehicles of varying sizes I’m not familiar with, and provide transport to other producers/staff.

18yvmf2,Anxiety,2024-01-05,Navigating OCD and anxiety,"hello:) this post is mostly self reflection, but I thought I'd share since I'd assume many people struggle with this.

OCD and anxiety play off each other, creating these rules and laws that don't make sense to anyone other than yourself. they're entirely illogical, and have no real grounding in ""reality"" (the collectively accepted hallucination). but these things don't matter to you when you're experiencing it. they feel like they are the most real thing you've ever felt. 

it ends up painting reality as this massive obstacle course. but you aren't on the same obstacle course as everyone else. they're all jumping between padded, colorful landing spots with some mud in between. but for you, a massive grey pit, filled with spikes, alligators, snakes, alligator-snakes, you name it, it's down there. There are small stepping stones, balancing apon other stones towering up to the top of the pit, with large spaces between, and it's your job to take the massive leap between these stones. being on one of these stones doesn't mean you're safe, of course not, that would be too easy. the towers shake, crack, and sway while you try to hold your balance, the longer you hold on the harder it will be to make the next jump. not only that, but the people around you are inadvertently damaging these towers, and it's your job to defend them to stay safe.

everyone else can see that you are on the same brightly colored, safely padded obstacle course that they are. they see that you're acting like only these small spots are safe, but they don't understand why you're doing it. how could they? you don't even understand why you're doing it.

your mind, specifically your thoughts, are not to be trusted. this is to say, your thoughts will paint this picture, and if you are identified with those thoughts, you will immediately go ""well I guess this is it"" and decide that it really is your job to get through this fake obstacle course, whether it kills you or not. it doesn't have to be this way. you can't stop these thoughts from occuring, but you can stop identifying with them, and let them be without affecting the painting in front of you.

identity with the awareness of the thoughts, that which experiences them, and that which experiences altogether. You can, and should, essentially identify *with* the present moment itself. that is who you are, outside of the noise, and outside of the drama of these obstacle courses.

because the reality is, no one is on an obstacle course, safe or not. nothing is actually happening at all. so why listen to your mind, when it only wants to make it harder?"
18yvinp,Anxiety,2024-01-05,"Symptoms, but mentally don’t feel anxious?","Lately I’ve been getting anxiety symptoms, specifically chest pain that comes and goes (feels better when I exercise) and the last week I’ve also been experiencing a tingling sensation beside my nose on my cheek. It’s a tingly, not a pins and needles. I did have an incredibly stressful May-November due to some cardiac issues that have been resolved for the most part. I did develop panic attacks this summer after I underwent a cardiac ablation due to the ablation paired prednisone was a recipe for disaster for me. So long story short is I was the most stressed I have ever been in my life and around late October I started to finally calm down. But the last month I’m getting physical anxiety symptoms despite not actively feeling stressed. Does anyone else get this? And shockingly, I’ve moved beyond the stage of anxiety of thinking everything is a brain tumor or a terminal diagnosis, probably because I have TONS of doctors for all my non related medical issues. Lol. I’m wondering if the body just holds on to stuff and even if I’m happily laying on the couch my body, but not my mind suddenly feels anxious and exhibits physical symptoms?? So many times I get the chest pain or tingling and think “but I feel fine” mentally. Anyone else??"

I could've solved this this past Tuesday but sat on the bed and cried because my anxiety got so bad an hour before I was supposed to leave that I rescheduled. Since health care sucks, my next appointment is end of the month. Last appointment I had was week before Christmas and I was so overstimulated and anxious I just went home before I suppose to have labs taken. 

It wasn't always like this. Yeah I despise going to the Dr for even routine checkups, but I went and was fine. Now I'm just a pile of nerves including spiked blood pressure and heart rate at the office which they assume is a problem. Plus them being blasé while I'm freaking out does help. 

That and I'm t2d and my blood sugar is always fluctuating due to what could be infection, but again it all boils down to getting to the Dr. But I'm just scared. I'm not on anything except buspar and it feels like it's worn 60mg is hardly doing anything.

This low self-confidence comes from a few things and I try to act like I don’t care about other people’s negative perceptions (unrelated to that other example I gave), but I always seem to have these exaggerated thoughts that cloud my trying to ignore it.

Basically this means your circadian rhythm has shifted way too late. The way to correct this is by taking 0.5-1.5 my of Melatonin about 3-4 hours (yes you heard that right. NOT at bedtime) before the time you want to be asleep. So if you wanna be asleep at midnight, take it between 8-9. And then set a time to wake up in the morning, and then within 30 min of that wake up time, use a 10000lux lightbox to trigger ur bodies wake up cycle. Both parts of this are equally important, so don't just do one or the other. After a week or so of doing this, you should start to get sleepy earlier at night, and wake up around the time you want. This should help a ton. After you correct this if you still have insomnia issues, then check things such as low iron, vitamin d3, thyroid health, all that."

I have always been that person who ruminates about the worst case scenario and overthink a lot. I can trace my anxiety back to my childhood, when I would get yelled at for something as dumb as a 60 on a math test, or not choosing a particular outfit.

18ys40p,Anxiety,2024-01-04,In person therapy vs. Video call therapy - Are both good? Do I need to change therapists?,"I've been having anxiety ""episodes"" every 5-6 months for the last nearly 2 years, each episode lasts about 2 weeks and then I snap back to having no noticeable anxiety until the next episode comes. I'm currently in the midst of an episode that started a little over 2 weeks ago. Usually, my symptoms are fairly mild and just consist of a feeling of uneasiness without much else, I can function fairly normally and have never looked into therapy before now.

However, this time it seems worse. It started with the usual feelings of uneasiness for the first few days, but then progressed into more of a feeling of dread and helplessness and outbursts of tears (for no reason), which I had never felt before. So, I decided to call my health care provider (Kaiser in California) and ask for help. I had the choice of seeing a therapist in person locally in about 3+ weeks or seeing a therapist (not local) via Zoom in about 5 days. So, I chose the Zoom call because it seemed like the quickest way to get help.  


I'm not really sure what to think of how it went. It was mostly just the therapist interviewing me (as expected on a first visit), but it seemed like we didn't really ""connect"" personally and it seemed a bit sterile (like she didn't really care, she was just doing an interview until her next appointment). There was really no ""treatment plan"" set for me during this appointment and she didn't even address the issue of whether I need meds. or should just do CBT or other activities for the next week until our next appointment 7 days later. Plus the way there's a delay sometimes with the Zoom call didn't help as we would talk over each other.

I'm wondering if this is just my therapist and I not connecting? Is it because we were on Zoom? Do I need to call Kaiser back and ask for in person care? I'd appreciate any opinions, thank you."

I've always been scared of growing up for some reason, but lately I've been terrified of the future. My mother has physical health issues as well, so even though they are not THAT old, I get worried that something will happen before I'm ready/equipped to handle their loss and the life after that. I live 200km away from my parents and came to visit for the holidays and just... haven't been able to leave because I'm scared of going back to my lonely life wondering about how my parents are doing. However, my uni is back from holiday break on Monday so I have to return home. I'm afraid to talk about this with them because my mom also has an anxiety disorder and I know this topic is very heavy on her.

18yrtwu,Anxiety,2024-01-04,Again strong focus on my heart,"Hey guys, some of you might have read my story already somewhere here - so i make it short:
About 1.5 years ago i developed a strong panic disorder, with mostly focussing on anything heart related since it startet with a racing heart and a lot of „heartskipping“.
During my therapy and the last 1.5 years i finally fought my way back to a normal life - still with axiety but i have it under control.

Since about a week the symptoms around my heart started to appear again. Mostly skipped bests or the feeling my heart „doing strange things“. I think most of you know what i mean.

After i had the first symptoms 1.5 years back i went to the ER 3 times and go everything checked. Including big blood work, many ecgs, one long time ecg, one stress ecg, one echocardiogrpahy. Everything was perfect. 

I got back into my training routine and am able to get into the high HR zones without the fear of death.

But since the symptomes came back a week ago, i am worried if it is too long ago that i got everything checked or maybe really is wrong with my heart. 

On one hand i know that this is just another phase of my anxiety but on the otherhand there are all these „what if“ questions.

Has anyone experienced the same or has any advice?

Thanks in advance!"
18yrpsa,Anxiety,2024-01-04,Vomiting before work every morning,"I’m 20F and I started a job my first real job as a paraprofessional in a SPED program in the high school I went to. 

As I first started I loved the job and loved the familiarity. I feel really comfortable there and the work is not super stressful just emotionally taxing sometimes. 

2 months in I started getting nausea and then throwing up almost every morning. It’s so bad to the point it’s just been bile and the blood vessels in my face pop from straining. My whole body tries to reject itself. I’ve had to use all my sick days because of this. But I feel completely fine after about an hour. 

This has been happening for months and I’ve been to the doctors and gotten acid reflux pills and even had an endoscopy. I refused to believe it was from work or anxiety because I’ve never experienced bad anxiety and I love my job. But I’ve seen others posts that describe exactly what I’m going through so it has to be anxiety. 

Please let me know if anyone has experienced this recently and what has helped you. It’s miserable waking up everyday sick when I just want to go to work. I genuinely don’t know what else to do."

18yra4z,Anxiety,2024-01-04,Im literally so scared of doing sports,"So when I was little I used to play a lot of sports but after a few months or weeks i dropped it out of anxiety that people will laugh at me for whatever reason or something and I stopped playing sports for like 4 years or so.

 After that my friend who was playing handball suggested I should also go to this sport so we can play together. I agreed because I always feel better playing a sport with someone i know. My anxiety and stress levels were still pretty high even tho she was here but I still felt a little bit better. The first week was alright but I was hella antisocial. In the second week this one girl who was like 1 grade  higher then me (I was 12 at the time but im 13 now) started saying that I'm really bad and I took that really hard. I know that it was stupid and her calling me bad was probably the truth bt she was really tall and intimidating and those 2 are not a good combo. She also said it with a tone of voice like i really pissed her off. She was in school with me and she was like one of the popular girls in school. 

Anyway so I got scared and I swear she sometimes looked at me.with an expression like I did something so wrong to her that she could never forgive me she literally gave me the side eye from the other side of the room What did I even do...

So after that I left because I was so scared and also because I didn't really understand how to play handball and I didn't even enjoy it I just went cause my friend went. I don't even know how my friend does it cause shes like 1 year youngwr then me but she never like shows that much of a problem when someone says something bad about her she just complains a bit about it but that's it and I don't know how to get that same mindset.

I feel like it's really embarrassing since im 1 year older so I should be more careless or something right? 
Anyway after that I got really bad anxiety when my mom mentioned going to a sport. I really love volleyball and dance since I'm good at them but I'm still scared because I'll get bullied and my mom doesn't understand how hard it is to ignore people who bully me and she thinks it will be as easy as it was for her because as she said ,, I was also shy but I got over it"" and shes acting like I can get over that as easily just cause were related or idk.
 I also am really shy to go to volleyball cause I've seen literally all the girls wear shorts and I'm too self conscious since I'm a pretty skinny girl and my legs are like pretty slim and I hate that cause i think It looks weird with shorts on and yeah that's basically everything.

18yr6u2,Anxiety,2024-01-04,Medication for severe stress/nervousness?,"Hello,  
I have a few group presentations and assignments at university coming up in January. Unfortunately, I've had a lot of problems with presentations and other assignments where an audience is present since my A-levels. I don't even do badly, but I don't feel healthy at all. Often the complaints start a few days beforehand, or when I think about an event in the future! Most people say something like ""Everyone has stress and is nervous!"", but for a few years now I've found that some people's feelings of stress are comparable to mine when I watch a soccer final - in other words, marginal!  
I tend to suffer from extreme sweating, diarrhea, a feeling of stones in my stomach, loss of appetite, dry mouth, tunnel vision, sometimes even a burnt-out feeling of listlessness, as if I were ill! In my 20s, my hair is already very gray, especially visible on the sides. Of course, this could just be genetic...

I had been thinking about ""exam anxiety"" for a long time, and even suspected ""social anxiety"". I don't have any other problems like this when meeting people or in everyday life when I don't have to be the center of attention. However, it's fair to say that it's not something that I always find particularly easy compared to others. With the possible exception of dating/romance/approaches, where I have strong symptoms, which is probably also the reason why I have completely withdrawn from this area and have never had any other experiences!  
It always seems to be the ""judgmental"" factor, in situations where there is the greatest risk of being criticized, that's where the symptoms start! (All the more so, of course, if a grade or future depends on it).  
Long story short - are there any drops or similar for me in the area (Europe) that could calm my nervous nerves? I've been using Soumme's anti-perspirant roller all year to combat the sweating attacks, and it really helps! (I may also have hyperhidrosis, by the way)  
I'd be delighted to hear your answers, because further academic education is really no fun like this and is also extremely stressful for my body and psyche!

Thank you all beforehand"

18ypbzq,Anxiety,2024-01-04,Almost fainted at the dentist and I feel awful about it,"I had horrible experiences with my dentist as a kid. I have come to learn as an adult he did some unnecessary procedures on me and in addition to that he would literally have his assistant hold me down in the chair while doing those procedures. Mix that with being an undiagnosed autistic kid and yeah... not a fun time.

I have an amazing dentist now. He, and everyone else that works there, is so kind and patient. I know I am extremely difficult due to my anxiety and it's annoying that I need frequent breaks and am shaking the entire time. I needed a filling redone on my bottom tooth which requires a shot into the cheek which is the worst for me. He used some magical topical numbing thing that was INTENSE and I felt almost nothing, way better than any other dentist I've been to where they just shake your cheek and you feel everything. However, I had a vasovagal response which I have had with shots before and had to lay there freaking out and cold sweating all over the chair while they sat there awkwardly waiting for me to get my shit together. I felt awful, because I don't want to be such a bad patient that they ""fire me"" as a patient because he is truly the best dentist I have ever been to.

I was super apologetic and thankful to them but I still feel bad they have to deal with this stupid anxiety that I hate so much. I wish I could just be normal. I have tried laughing gas before with no luck, and general anesthesia also freaks me out. It feels like a step back because I was starting to feel slightly better about going to the dentist and getting shots and I had done fillings before without feeling like I was going to faint.

This is just a rant more than anything because I am frustrated with myself. I am thinking about giving them a present because I really appreciate them being so patient and kind, but I don't know if that's overkill."

My family hasn’t been very supportive and didn’t even try to get it to where I was allowed to stay. I was simply just made to deal with it. Luckily, I have my boyfriend and I have been able to find an apartment with him that is a reasonable price.

The anxiety about finding a place is gone but, it’s been replaced with extreme anxiety about moving my living space. I have always felt the need to try and take control of a situation so I can better control the outcome but, I feel like it’s kind of consuming me. I found out not too long ago that we were approved for the apartment and all I can think about is getting everything prepared and ready but, my boyfriend is taking things a lot slower than me and it’s kind of making me upset. The anxiety I feel about moving has been giving my panic attacks too. For example, the past few days me and my boyfriend have planned on shopping for things we need and every single time we just haven’t. It sent me straight into a panic attack. Thankfully his family is able to help us all out with the move and is even willing to give us things and help us buy stuff we need. Due to this he is a lot less worried than I am and I think he’s having trouble seeing where I’m coming from when I talk about how anxious I am. It’s really eating at me.

He has been very reassuring and all that but, change is still a very scary thing for me and we are both still pretty young (I’m 19 and my boyfriend is 21). Any advice on how to get through the anxiety?"

Shaking, throwing up, upset stomach, clammy hands, heat flashes, irritability. It was bad and I won’t lie I did have multiple triggers leading up to it. My body feels off now. I heard of an anxiety attack hangover and I think that’s what it is. I went to the clinic and they put me on Hydroxyzine yesterday and yesterday was my first full day on it. I just feel off, like I get little jolts if I move to fast or somethings to loud for a sec. I’m irritable, and disassociating. It’s such an isolating feeling because I can’t describe it well.

18yop2w,Anxiety,2024-01-04,Anyone have similar experiences,"my anxiety journey started with a bad experience with weed. I used to smoke all the time and sometime around last year I started to get really anxious while doing it. Eventually last summer I smoked and had a bad panic attack that lasted for days, I didn’t feel real, my chest hurt all the time, felt like a fever dream almost. Then I started Prozac and while it helped with dpdr and didn’t really do anything for my anxiety. I was only on 10mg so maybe that’s why it didn’t work. But now Ive been on nothing for over 4 months now. I was prescribed lexapro but my ignorant self decided I could work on it myself, I’m just sick of feeling this anxiety, chest pain, foggy head, stuff like that. Is it worth to try another ssri or what should I do."
18yoidg,Anxiety,2024-01-04,A bit desperate,"Hi everyone! 

Just joined here because I am just hoping for a place to get some support or advice. 

I get so tired of myself. And I do not know how to stop it. 

I have this thing that I am very good at ""looking strong"" and reading other peoples emotion. I am a therapist by trait,  so figuren. But I have one kryptonite. When someone is angry at me, I cave. And I get so so anxious and cannot let it go until it is fixed.  Even when someone is unrightfully angry. For example, I had a client who is angry with me because she feels like I ""do not care about her"" - I know this is a traumarespons and I rationally know I am not doing thing wrong. So I will not react towards the cliënt but I just cannot let it go. It feels like someone is pulling on my chest and I feel so trapped.  Like a small child that is being yelled at and cannot get away. It feels like there is nothing I can do to call it. I trying to watch tv, color, write, run, ... but I keep feeling so anxious.  And I know the only moment it gets better is when the angry person is no longer angry and I will go over my own boundaries to make that happen. 

And I KNOW I should just let it go, but it feels like my body is telling me ""I am in danger"" even though I am rationally aware that I am not. 

I just don't know what to do. There is a reason like this every day that makes me so anxious it gets hard to function."

I'm having a bit of a problem the past few days. I always have anxiety in some way or another, but the weeks prior to Christmas I was doing relatively okay! I went back to the family home the past 2 weeks and that was hell for me (most of my anxiety and trauma stems from there.) Now I'm back home and I expected things to be better, but I feel like the stress I felt there and anxiety I constantly had has come back home with me and now I don't really know what to do? I guess I only need time to get over it again but I hate that I feel like this right now and I just wanna relax. The reason I think it feels 'random' is because I am at home and thought I'd immediately feel better again...

Is there anything I can do to quicken the process? I have OCD so I get very annoying intrusive thoughts all the time.

It was bad as freak for a few days until i took magnesium which got rid of most of the terrible anxiety and the inability to eat and or even work normally, and honestly i think I was just deficient in magnesium, but anyhow it still persists bad, just the anxiety and now whenever i take medicines or even drink teas I get really anxious and honestly i think its just my brain overthinking if im going to have a bad reaction to something, like even now I get very anxious of something bad happening when I take magnesium its not helping no more. Today I even tried to drink ginger tea and i start feeling anxious. Its weird I cant even take tylenol or anything without panicking the freak out and plus it dosent help that i search up side effects and interactions, but not even that it persists randomly like i could be having the best time of my life and then i think about my anxiety or i just get the feeling and then boom out of nowhere and i gotta calm my self down or just thug it out, very uncomfortable feeling i hate it. Also now I've been getting arrhythmia's like i breathe out or breathe in my heart pounds hard once then continues normally and i take a budesonide inhaler and that worries me something might be wrong with my heart or my thyroid. Also very recently like yesterday at 2 am i was praying to god to help me and then out of nowhere i started thinking i was schizophrenic because i kept on like having a back and forth convo with myself like i'd tell myself ""you want this"" and then I would say ""no i dont"" n it didnt help i searched up the symptoms ik its just my anxiety but man am i scared still. Anyways all I am asking for is just some tips that you guys have used to overcome the stuff i've been through or just some overall tips. I need help what doctor i should go to, like what they specialize in, but even then its difficult i dont have any health plan or nothing, keep in mind im under eighteen I got a semi wealthy grandpa i could ask to help but even then I dont feel like using him.

I was just watching TV and started feeling lightheaded, my whole body and chest felt so heavy and I had a hard time breathing. Like I couldn't get enough. My heart was racing and then my limbs started tingling like crazy and was almost painful. They felt heavy and shaky and hard to lift. I felt so out of it and my husband ended up calling 911. They showed all my vitals were normal and told me it was probably a panic attack. It slowly started subsiding as I answered their questions. But today I feel so tired and I'm overanalyzing everything I feel that's off in my body. I'm thinking of seeing my dr next week about it. I do have generalized anxiety disorder but this is the first time this has happened and I'm almost 30. I'm not on meds, and I do smoke 🍃 which usually helps my anxiety.

Starting Monday I got a bad headache that lasted a couple days. I think this is more related to caffine and coming back to work after two weeks off. 

However, did some googling saw it could be gum disease related. I usually haven't had mouth problems, brush three times a day, could be better at flossing. Haven't been to the dentist since covid (a lot of had to do with not having insurance for many years). 

This of course lead my anxiety to spiral. I have a dentist appointment scheduled for March 11th. But I am now goolging gum disease symptoms. Im second guessing if I have those symptoms. To make matters worse I flossed my teeth very intensly twice a day and now my gums are sore and a bit bruised. But my head keeps telling me it is like that cause of gum disease and not my excessive flossing. Worried my teeth are gonna fall out which I know is crazy. Was given a piece of chocolate this morning and felt a slight pain which has just made me panic. 

I have therapy Saturday and will bring this up then. I just need to know I am being over the top and it is my anxiety getting the better of me."
18yld4x,Anxiety,2024-01-04,Suddenly getting more and more afraid of the world and humanity,"I used to be so adventurous. I moved to a new city and went places alone all the time even though it wasn’t always the safest locations. I did not feel an ounce of anxiety. Last year I traveled across the world with just my sister who is also a smaller female. I didn’t feel any fear for our safety. 

But the last few months something has changed in me.

Now I struggle to get out of my car to enter a grocery store in a less desirable part of town. I canceled a retreat I was supposed to go to because I was scared of being somewhere new alone. I used to look around the world at people and see beauty and the promise of new expierences and connection. Now I look around and feel fear, sadness, and a general lack of faith in society and belief in people being good. I also stay up almost every night with the paralyzing fear of losing someone I love.

When it first started, i was high and so at first ithought weed triggered it, but i havent smoked since and im still freaked out — plus ive been a daily weed smoker for over a year, nearly two, and have never had a bad experience with it before. Ive been unable to keep any food down from how nauseous theyve made me and so i havent eaten a proper meal since the 30th. ive been to the emergency room and they gave me half of a benzodiazepine to take at that time, half of one to take home, a prescription for sertraline then sent me on my way as i had my first therapy appointment the next day and i guess they assumed that would fix everything. I still cant eat, if im not having an attack im anxious, i feel weak and i cant really get up and go out. my therapist and i discussed many coping mechanisms such as splashing my face with water, eating sour candy, going for walks, distractions, reaching out to loved ones. Some things help but only temporarily. I just want to go back to normal, before this i only experienced mild anxiety and could function perfectly fine. Now i cant stop ruminating on my past mistakes and calling myself an awful person. I am so desperate for any advice at all, anything is appreciated. Sorry if this is all over the place."

I was feeling very depressed and anxious about everything but also about nothing at the same time. Then I thought, if this was the olden days I wouldn’t have TIME to sit here and think this hard about stuff. I’d HAVE to be out collecting water, catching and killing food, doing survival things that you HAVE to do to survive. No time to even be anxious. But now technology is so advanced in so many ways I’m not even going to begin to list, that life is “easier” in so many ways. Leaving more time for other things. (One example: ordering food. Or even just cooking food in your own kitchen bought from a store is a time ‘saver’ compared to older days). Now we have allll this saved time to just sit in our minds and worry about things that don’t need to be worried about. Having anxiety about normal stuff because we have so much time to overthink. Obviously this doesn’t apply to everyone as many people do still have to use survival skills to live, some people don’t have anxiety, etc the list goes on to all the possible variations. Just some food for thought."

Well, that’s in two weeks and out of the 12 guys he invited I’m the only one that is undecided. I have very bad anxiety and panic disorder and for whatever reason my whole life I cannot sleep if I’m in the room with other people other than my wife. 

Work trips , bachelor parties, you name it. I’m always miserable and the most I will get is probably two hours total all night in and out.

He said the set up will be all 12 guys in bunkbeds next to each other   

Honestly, it’s my biggest fear and I’ve been stressing out about it because there is a group text and everyone keeps asking when I’m going to decide   

We have lots of guys in our class that have said they snore really loud so I have to decide going into it if I’m willing to do a three day retreat, knowing I won’t get any sleep. They also follow a schedule during the day so it’s not like I could just go take a two hour nap to catch up.

Part of me wants to do it and grow a pair and just see what it’s like but then the other part knows what it will be like and not to mention I will spend the following two or three days catching up

I got my current job in October. For the most part, I’ve really liked it. But my boss seems to also be an anxious person and she tends to be really intense/aggressive. We have an important meeting coming up next week and her nerves seem to have been off the charts. (Not sure if it’s sexist to mention this, but she’s also pregnant, and that may be playing a factor.)

Recently I’ve had a few instances of intense anxiety surrounding my job, and specifically whether my boss is happy with me and my performance. I’m truly trying my best, but there have been some miscommunications that don’t feel like they were completely my fault, but they may as well have been because I know they’ve frustrated my boss.

So many thoughts are going through my head.  I’m worried that my boss doesn’t like me, that she isn’t happy with my work, and that she sees me as incompetent. I’m worried that I *am* incompetent and that I’m doomed to lose this job, too.

18yj2up,Anxiety,2024-01-04,Relocation anxiety,"Hey all,
Sad to see myself back here tbh, I haven’t posted on here in quite some time. 
I just need advice and maybe some words of encouragement. I’ve struggled with pure o ocd for my whole life, there were times where it had full control over me such as 2021, 2022 and a bit of 2023, they were the worst years of my life. In April of last year I flipped a leaf and really had a grip on my ocd, I was at my happiest and made so much improvement in such little time. At the end of December I moved 5000km across the country to experience a change and pursue my dreams of adventure; that whole process was super stressful and hard ofc but my ocd never really resurfaced until I’ve finally settled in my new location. 

I know relocation depression is a thing but I’m just not sure why I have it. I like to think I have a strong mindset after years of battling with this.  I know what I’m doing is right, I’m not second guessing my decisions, I feel really really good about this move. But EVERYTHING else is bugging me again. Like stuff that’s not even relevant to moving, it’s just all the same thoughts that bothered me in 2021 like hocd, pocd, rocd, health ocd, etc. Getting a lot of Intrusive thoughts, a lot of repetitive thoughts. I’m also experiencing all the physical symptoms of course, super tight chest, headaches, insomnia, little to no of appetite, bursts of tears with no emotion behind it, feeling uneasy and panicky, the list goes on.
Of course I can’t beat myself up over it but I’m just so discoursed I’m back into this cycle, I thought I had it under control. 

I’ve been using thc and lorazepam to help the symptoms but it just makes me feel guilty for using drugs to manage symptoms. Idk if I just have to wait it out but I hate feeling like this. I just wanna sleep all day so I don’t have this pressure in my chest. Ughhhhh help."

18yix2f,Anxiety,2024-01-04,How do I better myself without OCD sabotaging me? Is this mania or just OCD?,"This post is long so if you want you can just read the **bolded** lines. 

**I've been entertaining the idea of going back to church, working out, and thinking/speaking more positively about myself and others. It's making me really happy and excited to think about the life that I can have when I imagine all the positive changes that I'm trying to make in the New Year. My problem is that every time I try to make a positive change or try to pull myself out of the fear and depression that OCD gives me, I think that I'm actually experiencing bipolar mania and not natural happiness. (I am not diagnosed bipolar, I am diagnosed with chronic OCD).**

Every once in a while I vow to make changes, big changes, in order to pull myself out of this OCD slump that I've been in for the past couple of years. I start to exercise, I make healthier food choices, I stop gossiping and talking badly about others and myself, and sometimes I even make a change in my appearance (i.e. wardrobe change, wearing different makeup, or a haircut, which I'm actually getting later today. I haven't cut my hair in 2 years, so this is huge for me). From time to time, going back to church shows up on that list, but I never fully commit to going back because it scares me into thinking I'm manic. 

For context, I grew up in the Christian church and only recently left about 5-7 years ago (I'm 27F).  When I think back on the time that I was the happiest, had the least amount of anxiety, and was the most content with my life, it was during the stretch of years when I was actively participating in my church community. Since leaving, my depression, anxiety, and OCD has become severe. So going to church isn't exactly an insane 180 coming out of left field, I have lots of friends and some family there.

What scares me most about all of these big changes at once, going to church especially, is that being manic often results in a negative impact on your life. My husband is an AVID hater and critic of the Christian church and all who follow the religion. If I go back to church, theres a pretty good chance that it'll negatively impact my marriage and may even result in divorce. Knowing this, I should not have any desire to attend, but I still want to and get excited over the idea. Does this point to mania? Or is this OCD kicking into overdrive?

**How am I supposed to know the difference between mania and just making grand plans and being very excited to start on all of them? Do normal people feel this way too? Is OCD sabotaging me yet again? How do I push through this intense feeling of fear and anxiety over making positive changes in my life? For the past 3 years, I've basically delayed or ended almost all positive changes, plans, and ideas to turn my life around and get out of this sticky messy trench because OCD (I think it's OCD) keeps warning me not to and telling me that these changes are too grand all at once and are too out of character so I'm either manic or experiencing psychosis. Please help offer insight in any way you can.**"
18yit02,Anxiety,2024-01-04,Check your Iron and Vitamin D levels!!!,"This is extremely important for those of your with depression, anxiety and depersonalization. Especially if you have any of the following symptoms at times: 1. Shortness of breath. 2. Pale skin 3. Insomnia 4. Dark circles 5. Brittle nails and hair loss 6. Cold hands and feet 7. Restless legs 8. Tendencies to chew ice 9. Depersonalization 10. Lack of focus or concentration 11. Dizziness upon standing up 12. Panic attacks 13. Seeing stars easily 14. Bluish lips and nails 15. Intense fatigue and apathy

1/3 women have low iron and don't know it. Especially if they have heavy periods. Men can have it too.

So doctors when they do a FULL iron panel tend to just focus on the ranges from the lab. Well I found out that these ranges are just an average taken from people aged 1-99. You need to find your optimal levels, not normal levels. So my ferritin levels (iron stores) were fine, but my iron saturation, total iron and MCHC were not and those had to be calculated by a total iron panel and a CBC, and then I had to not listen to standard doctors, and instead look for my optimal levels. If I had listened to my GP they would've said my levels were fine because they were on the lowest end of the *normal* range, even though they were no where near optimal. If i had listened to my GP, id still be struggling. Sally Jacks has great videos about it on YouTube. I've been correcting my iron levels, as well as taking lamotrigine (not bipolar, just for depression and OCD) and I notice I can take deeper breaths, the world doesn't look so flat and grey, my sleep is better and my mood is getting better. Do not skimp on these things. Depression and anxiety is not an SSRI deficiency, but often comes from actual deficiencies."

\- They'll get lost

\- Hurt badly

\- They will get addicted to drugs / alcohol

\- Fear they will get involved with bad company etc

18yi1h0,Anxiety,2024-01-04,Chronic Irritability,"Hello all. My mental health journey started back in 2016 when I had PPD and PPA after having my daughter. I took 100mg of Zoloft until 2017 and then weaned off of it. I went back on it in 2018 at 50mg for PMDD (both times it was prescribed by my OB/GYN) I recently weaned off of it again because while it helped with my irritability, I had no sex drive, night sweats, and just kind of felt emotionless as far as happiness went.

I've only been weaned off of it for a short time but my irritability is at an all time high. Any sound my husband makes (chewing, yawning, eating, tapping, snoring, breathing) is just sending me to a new dimension of anger. I can feel my fuse getting shorter and shorter. I'm also about to start my period so I'm sure this is my PMDD without the Zoloft.

All this to say, given the other unpleasant side effects I was having with the Zoloft, should I ask my doctor about another medication? Should I give myself more time to be completely weaned off the Zoloft and see if I feel better as it hasn't even been 3 weeks of being off the SSRI? What has worked for you? I feel like my marriage is going to be destroyed with my mood swings if I don't do something soon but at the same time if I need to just wait it out maybe I should. I see a therapist which I am planning on discussing this with but should I see a psychiatrist as well? I don't know. Please help.

I have a history of anxiety, alongside depression and have dealt with both now for years, I have been in therapy twice before. 

However, recently I’ve been experiencing symptoms such as the following: 

•head tension, almost like my skull is being squeezed, this is near my temple, top of head, back of head, this tension can extend into my jaw, neck and shoulders. 

I have noticed that it can, more or less, go down if I try to distract myself or forget about it. However I have a habit of waking up in the morning and my brain going like “so where’s that tension/pressure? HERE IT IS!” And then.. boom. Chronic. 

•occasional nausea 

• disassociation, like I almost feel as if I’m either floating or don’t exist.

I actually went to a walk in hospital clinic the other week (and have an appointment with my local gp on Monday) and they assessed me, blood pressure and everything, all vitals fine. They said it was most likely anxiety/depression etc etc. 

I know I probably sound ridiculous but I can be quite the hypochondriac and I keep panicking (sometimes to the point of hyperventilation) that I have something severely wrong with me (like a severe neurological disorder, a tumor etc) and I’m going to end up dead. 

I keep trying to be logical with myself but it’s just falling flat, I am consistently in a state of ‘catastrophe’.

I feel absolutely awful about this years later, and I can’t forgive myself because my anxiety keeps running it through my head. The dog didn’t care at all and it was nothing serious, she didn’t seem bothered by it at all. Regardless, I know what I did was really badly wrong and I shouldn’t have done it, and I never will do such a thing again. My mother kicks her lightly when she is badly behaved which is why I’m guessing I assumed it was okay do to, but obviously i know now it’s not.

I know this is due to me not leaving the house for 5 days now since we are in winter break, and also looking back at all the small triggers and stressful situations i've had to face the past few months it's incredible i haven't had a meltdown until now.

I thought i was strong but one of the main triggers for me (but not the only one) has been seeing my aunt struggle with anxiety and going through the same thing i went through last year, trying to help her has brought me some horrible flashbacks and feelings i thought i wasn't gonna be affected by now, but i guess i'm not made of stone. Also i have been flooded with work at uni (i'm doing my thesis so it's kinda hard), things in the romantic area haven't been so good either, my grandma is not feeling good and i'm having some existential crisis regarding the fact that this is my last year of uni and i am going to be a full adult soon.

So taking everything into account, my mind decided to trigger these anxious feelings over the first dumb stupid intrusive thought i got, because it seems like those 5 days i have spent inside my house have stopped the hectic lifestyle i got and my brain has started to think about everything and is like ""HERE!! SOME STIMULATION!!! now u r gonna get anxious overrrrr........ \*points at random household item\*"" (it's kinda funny when u think about how the brain works lmfao). And now i'm having all the usual anxiety symptoms i used to have: appetite loss, chills, heart racing...

Then I started taking anxiolytic supplements and all the cognitive and physical symptoms that anxiety caused me disappeared, including the drooping eyelid.  When the effects of the supplements wear off, the anxiety and droopy eyelids return.  This is proof that the droopy eyelid is a symptom due to anxiety, can anyone tell me if they have had the same symptom?

As said in the title, I'm so stupidly tired of being anxious all the time.

I've had some scares with my heart, and despite the multiple ER visits telling me I'll be okay, I still don't trust my body or myself.

I'm aware I have health anxiety and OCD (Of which I've recovered from in the past), but my symptoms are getting so strange that I can't tell the difference between anything real vs my anxiety. I lose sleep over it, get attacks over it, and my brain jumps from one obsession to the other, so much so to the point that it attempts to convince me I have multiple health issues in the span of a day and I live in constant fear of death.

18ycvev,Anxiety,2024-01-04,Anxiety during conflictual conversations.,"(M, 30yo)

Hi. I'm looking for ways to deal with my issue. I dealt with anxiety and mental issues all my life but today I feel good in my life overall. I still have ups and downs but I can deal with it.

It's not hard for me to talk to people in a casual context anymore because I worked on it over the years. People tend to view me as confident even. But as soon as the conversation becomes too conflictual I get all shaky and I have trouble expressing myself. Even for the most trivial things. One recent good example:

  
Two weeks ago I was looking for a harness for my dog. I saw a spike collar on the ground, the type of torture collar designed to hurt the dog. So I showed it to the seller (because it is now illegal in my region) as I geniunely thought it was still here by mistake. He went full on defendind the thing, which made me really unconfortable. I told him as best as I could that I thought it was wrong and there was other means way more respectful of the dog. He was calm, but on the other end there was like a **storm in my head**. I couldn't keep calm and express myself clearly.

This happens all the time and as i'm unable to defend myself people **tend to get bossy**. 

I do know it is related with my father being angry all the time when i was a kid because I get exactly the same feeling. I feel **suppressed, shaky and unable to stand for myself**. I used to flee those kind of situations but now i'm a grown up and I want to be able to deal with it. I'm in pretty good shape, working out, eating well but it's not helping much on those particular situations. When it happens i'm **taken by surprise and I just can't react properly.**

&amp;#x200B;

So, sorry for the long post, but have you ever felt the same way, and if so, what did you do to work on it? I'm assuming there are people that struggle way more than me here so I'm taking any advice.

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks and have you all a wonderful year."
18yc9do,Anxiety,2024-01-04,Physical anxiety wearing me down,"Really just making this post just to reach out and connect during states of anxiety. I am currently feeling very physically shaken, tired, anxious. My thoughts are stable, and I don’t have any racing thoughts or any thoughts of self-harm, it’s just a pure feeling of physical anxiety, muscle tension, restlessness, stomach problems, and a slight feeling of overall illness. I do feel somewhat lonely and down but these are not extreme feelings, just general depression. 

Currently on Lexapro. That helps somewhat, and it’s much better than being off of it. I took 25mg of Benadryl just to calm down just a bit, and that is helping a bit currently as of right now.

I was prescribed Buspirone a few months ago. That did help at first, but then suddenly stopped being effective, and I noticed it was making me very dizzy and more tired all of a sudden, like my heart is racing. 

I stay away from most caffeine, other than a very small half cup of coffee in the morning (which is all I can tolerate and it generally boosts my mood). I try to drink lots of water. 


I had recently come down with COVID over the holidays, and that was terrible for my anxiety. I had bad panic, worry and couldn’t sleep. Eventually that did subside a bit as I got over COVID, even though I do feel some residual effects. I really think COVID kinda made me go haywire and kick my anxiety back up. 

Basically I was seeing a therapist prior and they had once given me Propranolol , and that was super effective for calming me down when needed. However the therapist office lost funding and I couldn’t get the medicine refilled from my former therapist anymore. So I had seen a general practitioner and they tried Celexa instead and that made things worse, then they tried Lexapro and Buspirone. Everything was good with that, except for the Buspirone. 

Today I am waiting out a few hours when my doctors office opens so I can see about getting back on Propranolol , just to help with the physical symptoms of anxiety, worry, and panic that I am dealing with. 

Wish me luck"

I have diagnosed General Anxiety Disorder and I do see someone for it and I’m on medications and all that jazz but…

Last year I had two consecutive miscarriages. Both were before the 8 week mark and back to back.

Now I am obsessively taking pregnancy tests trying to see a positive line. It’s gotten to the point where I go back into the trash to take another look… I take photos of them and edit them to B&amp;W or invert the colors.. I mean when I say obsessive, I mean it.

The other part of this is that I keep seeing a “faint positive line” but when I show my husband he sees nothing and when I look at the inverted photos, low and behold, there’s no second line. 

Is this something anyone can relate to? I’m really struggling and don’t talk to my therapist for another few days."

I worry myself to point that I start having phantom pains all over my body, especially on places I know I have a mole, I’ll make myself sick to the point of vomiting, I’ll start having panic attacks. It never stops. Therapy doesn’t help with it, talking about it with friends doesn’t help, having the spots that are worrying me checked out doesn’t help. I’m at the point I just can’t take it anymore.

Every night when I go to bed, I have to leave the TV on because the background sound gives me something to focus on instead of my own thoughts. I have to keep this song playing in my head non stop when I’m at work or I’ll make myself sick by thinking about my health. I can’t wear headphones at work so if I forget the words to that song, or allow myself to stop playing it in my head I’ll immediately start spiraling. It’s so exhausting and frustrating that I feel like I’m going insane.

I don’t know what to do anymore. I feel like I’ve tried everything, and I don’t think completely blocking out my thoughts, which is the only coping mechanism I find gives me any relief, is healthy. I just want to be better, I want to have a normal life where my skin killing me isn’t my first, last, and only thought every single day. It’s been years, and it can’t take it anymore.

18y9qby,Anxiety,2024-01-04,Recently prescribed propranolol,"Hi there, long story


I’m a 23F and on Christmas Eve Eve, I had an SVT at my job. I’m a transporter at a hospital (Thank God because the ED is a floor down). I was talking to my boss about something that was going on at work that was stressing me out. The conversation wasn’t unpleasant or anything. After we were done talking, I stood up and suddenly the episode hit. Now, I’ve had palpitations in the past from anxiety. This was not that. My HR went from 70-80BPM to 200. And climbed. Went pale, could barely walk. Craziest thing ever. My boss sent me downstairs immediately, my EKG was taken, and it was totally normal. Vitals were normal. They put me in an exam room. The minute the technician shut the door, it happened again, and it was the worst. 80 BPM. 100. 130. 160 (oh shit, haven’t seen that before). 180. 220. I hit a max HR of 242. I can see through the window on the door one of the nurses, who makes eye contact with me panicking. And that’s when rapid response comes in
Vagal maneuvers didn’t work. Ice didn’t work. So they slap on cardioversion pads and give me adenosine. HR successfully dropped to about 120 BPM. They keep me overnight and determine my heart is structurally well. Stress test clear. BP was really good. Blood work was all cleared (minus the D-Dimer but, because hey! Body just ran a marathon).


They sent me home with metoprolol and the doctor kinda said “You’re young! Only take it if your HR hits 198 BPM which is your 100% capacity.” (????) Had a follow up with my primary because of some chest pain and because the metoprolol was dropping my HR and BP wayyy too low. (30BPM). When I told my doctor everything she said “The doctor said what?” And that I shouldn’t even be taking metoprolol because of my asthma. She was heavily under the impression that it may be anxiety related, and thought propranolol would be nicer to my body, which is where my questions come in…



A. has anyone experienced this before??
B. I was prescribed 10mg once a day. I’m on day three today and I woke up in the middle of the night, BP 140/88, HR 130 from laying. I couldn’t even lift an arm without my HR jumping. Is that a normal effect from the medication just wearing off? Does anyone else experience this? My first time taking it, I took my first dose at 5:30ish PM because the doctor wanted me to start asap and see if it helped my symptoms. So with that, I slept perfectly fine. When I woke up yesterday, I took it at 8AM to see how well the medication would work during my “working hours”. But with that, it wore off by around 8PM the same day and minimal activity made my HR jump for sure… which leads up to now. I just woke up with my HR climbing, BP elevated, and shaking like a madman.



Thank you for reading all this if you’ve made it this far. I have struggled with anxiety since I was a teenager. But this is the most it’s manifested physically. I’m hoping this is manageable and I didn’t stress myself into a poor state of health (although so far, doctors really believe I’m healthy and can’t find a cause for my attack bcs !!! What healthy person has a HR of 242??)


P.S Feel like I should note that all this did start after an exceptionally stressful couple of months between home and work and an eating disorder relapse."

I’ll be on the verge of sleep, but as soon as I’m out I’m jolted awake by an overwhelming feeling of doom/dread/fear, fight or flight and the thought that I’m about to die. It can happen anywhere from 1-4 times before I’m actually able to sleep. Not to mention my left arm/shoulder start to ache and I can’t get comfortable no matter how I lay because of the pain. 
Does anyone else experience this? How do you cope? What should I do? 
I’m trying to avoid taking anti depressants or anti anxiety medications for personal reasons. I was prescribed sleeping pills once, they worked like a charm but they’re considered a narcotic(?) and I’m told I’m too young to need them and I’ll become dependent. 
I’m at a loss, and fairly desperate because of the severe lack of sleep I get!

18y8xo4,Anxiety,2024-01-04,Are long / daily panic attacks normal? I’m struggling to cope,"I’ve dealt with anxiety my entire life, but I’ve only just recently developed panic attacks (~1 year since the first one) and they almost always occur while sleeping.

They used to be sporadic, but now they’ve become a lot more frequent and intense. 

I’ve had at least 1 panic attack each day since the beginning of the week. Always with a racing heartbeat, lightheadedness, shortness of breath, and shaking/trembling. 

Yesterday, I had a panic attack that lasted ~16 hours. I went to the doctor and had an EKG and blood work done, but everything came back normal. It was one of the worst days of my life - at some point my heart rate shot up to 152 bpm and no grounding exercises seemed to work.

Does anyone else experience daily / long panic attacks, or is there something horribly wrong with me? My health anxiety is killing me and it’s exacerbating my already terrifying panic attacks. I keep obsessively checking my Apple Watch to see what my heart rate is.

I tried to sleep peacefully today, but an hour into my sleep I woke up with a racing heart. I’m so worried that what I’m experiencing is not a panic attack, but rather a serious, life-threatening condition.

I would really, really appreciate hearing from anyone else who’s had similar experiences and how they’ve coped with them thank you 😭🙏🏻"
18y8wt7,Anxiety,2024-01-04,Anxious about partners wellbeing,"My partner (F23) and I (M23) have been together for around 10 months. I am madly in love with her, very convinced that she is the woman I want to spend the rest of my life with. She used to have Blood Cancer as a child and has been cancer free for the past 9-10 years. 
Recently we done a blood test for her and the doctor advised her ALT levels are high for a person with a healthy life style who's physically active. This has triggered a tremendous amount of anxiety in me. I am constantly worried about this being a secondary form of cancer and I cannot function. This is my first time dealing with anxiety so paralysing. I don't think I am a very religious person, yet I cannot stop praying for her health and safety. All of this is happening because of elevated ALT levels and no other symptoms, her doctor has advised her liver function test look normal and there were no other abnormalities in her blood which I'm sure is a good sign. She did also have a mildly severe case of COVID just before her blood test. I am just so terrified of losing the love of my life. I am literally fucking crying right thinking about it and I don't know how to cope. I can't talk to her about it as much as I need to because I don't want to trigger her health anxiety (understandbly she has health anxiety and PTSD due to her cancer). I just feel so lost. I don't know what I can do.. help me, tell me what you think of the elevated ALT levels, is my fear reasonable? What can I do? I am very new to anxiety, I never cared enough about anyone or myself to worry about health or death and now she is in my life, most precious thing in my life and I'm constantly having intrusive thoughts about losing her.

18y8nf2,Anxiety,2024-01-04,has anyone been skeptical about having anxiety/starting meds?,"im in my 20s and was diagnosed with adhd like 5 months ago and started taking meds. they’ve been great and have helped a lot of my bad habits. over the last few months of meeting w my psychiatrist for quick updates he has mentioned multiple times that he suspects i may also be dealing with anxiety. i was skeptical cuz ive always viewed myself as a pretty calm person. i always thought of anxiety as this like constant fear, worry and panic attacks. anyway i also started seeing a therapist for the first time unrelated to my psychiatrist and told them about my adhd and mentioned a few of the symptoms that led to my diagnosis. they also said it seems like i am dealing with anxiety. i told my psychiatrist about this and after a long conversation he prescribed me lexapro. i’m hesitant to start it because i really don’t know if i need it, but at the same time i keep wondering whether ive just managed to live with these problems for so long by masking them, and taking lexapro would reveal this to me. 

i guess my question is if anyone on here has dealt with a situation like this and how they navigated it. what are some symptoms that you’ve experienced that aren’t as commonly associated with anxiety? how confident and self aware were you that you needed to start medication? if anyone is down to share by commenting or messaging me i’d love to hear your experience"

18y8bgj,Anxiety,2024-01-04,Anxiety regarding computer issues.,"Hello! This post might feel a little, odd? In regards to the things that trigger my anxiety. But to give a little bit of background, I have general anxiety as well as some pretty bad social anxiety, so, this causes me to spend a lot more time indoors working on things on the computer in my free time. This by no means is me saying I spend *all* my time inside, just, a good majority. Which brings me to the issue at hand. I have anxiety regarding computer issues, the idea of my computer having any problem overwhelms me (As a big stress for me would be having to spend money to repair/upgrade certain things.)

I believe I might have some OCD tendacies with it too in regards to constant checking, seeing if space on my computer is running low, or, for that matter doing a lot of ""spring cleaning"" on my computer in an attempt to prevent further issues, which, then turns into me cycling back to checking and, if anything is even SLIGHTLY off from the day prior I get overwhelmed and have to go into problem-solving mode again.

I was curious if others happened to have any advice on how to properly avoid doing this routine of checking + problem solving because of anxiety. I've brought it up with a therapist a few months ago but it felt like it wasn't really something they had a good suggestion on. It feels weird being so anxious about something like this, but, because of the anxiety regarding it a lot of my enjoyment for things on the computer (Such as games and the like) get thrown out the window because I'm so focused on trying to keep it working that I push aside likes and interests. I mainly just am hoping to get some advice on overcoming this over time.

Didn't she reply to the message because I had already apologised earlier if she felt uncomfortable because I was communicating with her?

I have always wanted to do medicine since i was young, thankfully I achieved this goal but did not realize all that came with it.

 My family and I decided the best option m would be for me to go to an international medical school that had a good reputation of matching back to canada. This came with a lot of expenses and my parents were unable to get a loan due to loans on properties and etc. Since the canadian dollar has been increasingly dropping compared to the euro it has made it nearly impossible to pay for tuition and accommodation. Every single day i near panic attacks at the thought of them not being able to make payments and my unpredictable class schedule makes it impossible to have a job. Most other kids at my school have family members that are doctors or in general come from fairly wealthy families and are always able to spend money freely whereas i worry about having enough leftover to buy grocery and the constant guilt of my parents spending all their money on my education eats away at me, at one pint my parents had less than 1000 dollars after paying my fees.

This happened after rejecting someone and trying to leave an abusive situation and for trying to expose a police department for drug and sex trafficking and for knowing bad things about scary important people. I also used to struggle with substance abuse so it would be a believable story or plausible if I died of an overdose no one would question it. I did not willingly ingest these drugs. Fast forward to today I was also shot at months after that and then assaulted multiple times by strangers and then assaulted by the police a couple times after that again(sexually and physically).

I also have twitching (I don't know if I could call it twitching but it seems to fit this description) and I can't eat well at the morning or lunch (I'm 99% sure this is from my anxiety).

My anxiety is caused because of the fear of prion disease but I calmed down by a lot after many people voiced out that it wasn't prion disease"
18y6bpg,Anxiety,2024-01-04,Question about propranolol,"Hello fellas. Have little story, kind of hard to write but lets try. I been having insane heart pulse jumps, especially on hangovers. Not sure if its panic or not, but I remember waking up on hangover and my heart went to 200+ over. Been like 5 times, mostly hangovers, but happened also on sober days ( mostly after heavy meals ). Doctor prescribed propranolol, she said take 40mg in morning and check how its gonna be in day, you can also take 40mg in evening. What I did is I took first time only half pill (20mg) and never took more than that. I did some horrible things, I took it first time when I came back from city after drinking many drinks, my heart was 130-140 when I was laying. I was like okay fk it and I will just take this, I took it and went to sleep after like 20min. I woke up without hangover ( thats not normal because I always have hangover ) and when I woke up my heart was like 70-80, when on hangover its always like 140-150, if I get bad minds it goes to 200. Okay, that was first time. Next time I  took it before I went to party, my heart always was like 100 when drunk, when normal was always 130-150 while being drunk. Then I felt like its god drug and I started taking it always before OR while OR after being drunk. Everything goes well, but I feel doing very wrong. I mean I dont have any side effects or anything, but feeling doing very wrong with this medicine. The thing is, if I dont take it, my heart goes sometimes so fast I cant even understand why. I had heart tests and everything, they said my heart is healthy. I dont think its panic attacks, because last time when I had heart rate over 200+ I felt kind of calm and it was racing soooo bad. I know I should avoid alcoho, but the point is that I want to figure out wtf is wrong with me because its not because of alcohol. I had it also when I was sober. Alcohol just makes it come faster. Whats wrong with me? What should I do? Sorry for bad grammar and bad sentences. "

18y60l2,Anxiety,2024-01-04,Help with Meds,"I'm 19F and have trial and errored 9 different medications including Biphentin, Fluoxetine, Sertraline, Strattera, Quetiapine, Risperidone, Dextroamphetamine, and Lamotrigine (and I think Clonidine but I can't find my notes), most having really bad effects on myself and meds just don't seem to work. I have Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), Hallucinogen Persisting Perception Disorder (HPPD) (permanent), severe Social and General Anxiety, Major Depressive Disorder, Derealization-Depersonalization, and really bad insomnia.  


With trying so many meds in a short period of time HPPD effects worsened, and eventually more so with some substance use eventually leading to a schizo-affective type disorder. It's hard to find a good med as I don't handle brain fog/heavy headspaces well, stims crash hard and cause hppd/psychosis and insomnia symptoms to worsen, many drag me down and pit me in depression (very handled now and I don't want it to ever get worse), and most dissociate me more meaning many anti-anxiety medications don't work.  


Too make it clear I'm not looking for anything for hallucinations or depression, but something that won't worsen those things, as well as help manage dissociation/depersonalizing/help focus and anxiety. Also looking for something for sleep.  


I don't smoke weed or do other substances except maybe once a year, I drink every so often, but get drunk very rarely, I smoke on special occasion and often vape, and drug or other addictions aren't a worry. I don't have a fast metabolism and other than bad care habits I don't have any health problems and am not immuno-compromised. Am sensitive (skin or heartburn for example) but have no known allergies.  


Looking for any medications, shroom strains, drug microdosing, or even supplements or superfoods that based on this information would be the likely best benefit for my type, and want to know what's worked for any of you with an anxiety-dissociation combo. I'm open to any suggestions, and articles or management tips too.

\-have no luck w meds  
\-have ADHD, HPPD, schizo-affective, insomnia, severe dissociation, chronic anxiety  
\-mostly functioning, but dissociation and anxiety is bad and my episodes make me dumb af  
\-need help focusing, managing anxiety, and something for sleep.

18y5wsa,Anxiety,2024-01-04,Xanax,"I had my first panic attack when I was about 27 (42 now) and my doctor prescribed me Xanax 1mg. Around 6 years ago I was bumped up to 4mg per day (2mg twice a day).

I have terrible heart anxiety, which until a month ago was completely in my head, but made me a nervous wreck. I couldn’t stand in open fields (like my kids soccer game) as I would worry there is no where to go if I have another panic attack.

Recently, I had an EKG and heart echo that revealed possible minor damage. I have a nuclear stress test scheduled for next Friday and I am absolutely terrified. I wake up terrified, I go to sleep terrified. 

I know that 4 mg is generally the maximum a doctor will prescribe. I have read about 4 mg per day spread out over 3 doses, how exactly does that work?

I have an appointment tmw with my family doctor for my usual Xanax refill, and I’m really curious if I have hit the maximum Xanax level. Has anyone gone through this situation? 

Does it keep you more level by taking 3x a day instead of 2?

I don’t want the doctor to think I am just trying to up my xanny for the hell of it. They were the ones I first reported my heart problem to, and they know my history of anxiety and panic attacks. What is the best way to approach this with my dr?"

The speaking symptom specifically is really troubling me. It takes the most tiring effort just to get my mouth to move and speak normally in certain parts of the day. I’m so so scared. I have an appointment with a neurologist tomorrow, but don’t know if I should go to the ER to get checked right away instead? I don’t know. My panic and anxiety has been very intense and pretty constant the past 2 months, so I’m worried that that in of itself can cause me to have a brain bleed. Can panic even cause a brain bleed to happen? I really hope not. Any advice or insight is appreciated because I’m so scared right now."
18y5l7o,Anxiety,2024-01-04,Mad how I handled my C word scare (M20),"
I have self diagnosed myself with advanced prostate cancer after having pissing issues earlier in the 2023 that I ignored. I feel like a fool for not going to a doctor,  but the reason why I didn’t go to a doctor is because I thought it was more of a pelvic floor issue. In order to piss, I would bring my phone out and start scrolling then the piss would come out fine. 

Fast forward to now I lost 13 pounds in a span of a month and a half, chest pains, shortness of breath and classic cancer symptoms. The only thing that hasn’t happened yet is I’m not pissing blood or ejaculating blood. 

My other symptoms started mid October, like headaches, blood in stool so I was convinced I had a brain tumor or colon cancer when I should have been getting the piss issues checked out instead. It turns out my CT scans of head, pelvic and abdomen, multiple x rays, blood work, colonoscopy, endoscopy and PSA all came out good which has me stumbled. 

I’m seeing a urologist next and getting my prostate checked out so I’m hoping it’s nothing serious but considering the other symptoms I doubt it. I’m only 20 years old so the fact I might have prostate cancer has me fucking perplexed, that would mean I was showing symptoms since I was 19 years old. 

Either way, I wish I got my symptoms checked out sooner and possibly gave myself a death sentence waiting this long. I hope you guys get checked out sooner than I did and don’t be a fool like me. I don’t know how I’m going to explain to my parents that I ignored my pissing issues and their son is going to die at 20 because of my ignorance"

18y5csb,Anxiety,2024-01-04,Pregnancy Scare Anxiety???? Help!,"Pregnant From Anal..?

Ok I know this is *ridiculous* but I cannot stop worrying - I'm so anxious and can't take a pregnancy test for another ten days to confirm what I suspect to be true, which is that I can't be pregnant, but I am just totally freaking out. I get this insane pregnancy anxiety about every other month from absolutely minor sexual encounters, and this month is no different. Beware, it gets a little inappropriate... 

My fiance and I tried anal sex (unprotected) for the first time last week. I am not on any kind of birth control because we don't like the idea of all the hormones, and we don't do PIV. Generally it's just oral or using our hands. Anyway, we wanted to try something new last week, so we gave anal a try. I was on the bottom the whole time with him on top of me, and he came inside. Then we laid like that for a minute or so before he pulled out. He grabbed a towel and put it under me and I laid like that for a few moments before I went to the bathroom. I stayed in there for about ten minutes, constantly wiping (front to back) and trying to get out as much of *it* as I could. After everything was coming back dry, I washed up with some soap, got dressed and we went about our evening. I didn't feel anything else come out. 

This was on day 8 of my cycle. According to the Flo app, I'm supposed to ovulate today, which is day 13. So, technically, I would have been just barely in my fertile window when this incident occurred. However, I've been taking some OPK tests every day since then to figure out when I ovulate (trying to put my mind at ease) and I haven't had an LH surge yet, which means I might ovulate later than today, meaning that 6 days before ovulation would basically be impossible to get pregnant. I'm also worried that somehow I may have ovulated early this cycle, which is why I haven't gotten a surge.... If that's the case, chances are higher that I was in my fertile window for the month. 

I know that anal sex does not directly lead to pregnancy - what is making me so anxious is everything I read online that says it's *technically* possible if semen were to run or drip into my vulva. As I mentioned, I was on the bottom the whole time (my bottom was never positioned above my vulva) until I was sitting up in the bathroom, but I was very careful to wipe everything away. What I'm stressed about is that perhaps some of the semen got into the lube that we used (which was all over my lower area, and even smeared a bit on my vulva) and traveled up into me before I had the chance to wipe it away. I'm also worried that perhaps I wasn't as diligent at wiping myself in the bathroom as I thought I was and maybe some semen was able to make it's way inside at that point. 

I am freaking out! I have done this many times before where I convince myself that I'm somehow pregnant from some kind of sexual encounter, whether it's oral or kissing or some insane way that semen may have been transferred to me, and of course I have never been pregnant. My fiance is frustrated because I talk myself into this idea that I'm pregnant and it's all I can think about until I can take a pregnancy test. I'm frustrated too, but I just cannot let it go and can't seem to tell myself that I won't be the 1 in a thousand that it happens to. Thoughts????"

Been gradually improving since the first couple years of it through therapy and increase in lifestyle wellness, as well as lavender essential oil. While I'm in a stable spot now relatively, still experience a lot of rumination, and occasional anxiety attacks involving nausea. Was trying to find information on certain gene mutations that may be causing nutritional deficiencies, came across folic acid and the MTHR gene mutation that apparently affects a fair amount of the population, but there was also some controversy around it. Furthermore, was reading about COMT, this just from page one of google but it reads ""People with underactive COMT variants have high epinephrine and norepinephrine levels. This makes them worse at coping with stress. Imbalances in catecholamine neurotransmission put them at increased risk of some anxiety disorders."" Also some people suggesting vitamin B9.

&amp;#x200B;

 I'm going to keep going into it, but was just wondering if anyone has already done a deep dive into this stuff? Even tried some out, or done a genome sequencing and figured out what genes are being expressed differently/mutated that may be causing  nutritional deficiencies and in turn anxiety. Let me know!"

The following days after i tested negative were hell because i was thinking abt the headache 24/7. it seemed to give me dizziness and hurt everytime i laid my head back a bit or faced down. which scared me even more since its a positional headache and thats another symptom of brain tumor. it also seemed to be pulsing at night and it hurt. however i never threw up or had brain fog or anything.  my neck and shoulders are still stiff till this day and that also gives me anxiety. i’m going back to school soon and will get checked up by the dr at school but i’m scared that it’s a tumor or aneurysm. anyone else have this problem?"

My husband and I are doing this, while giving ourselves grace, by finally agreeing to be more intentional with our diets and workouts (or lack thereof). The bad part? We struggle from MAJOR gym anxiety, especially the hubs. It’s something that so many of us anxious folks must experience, but how on earth do you get over it? Gym anxiety leads to body-image anxiety, which has had a nasty grip on my husband for the last few years. I’m proud of us because we just scheduled time at a Cross-Fit-esque local gym, and are meeting with the coach next week to chat! My worry is that my husband will go, feel self conscious, and then immediately back out of our desired plan and goals. This is a pattern for him, as he will agree to try a fitness routine for a couple weeks, but after a few days becomes so burnout from self-consciousness and the effort required to follow through that we bail on the plan. 

Others who experience gym anxiety ioety, what has helped you break this cycle? I’m hopeful for this new path we’re on in 2024, but fear being let down again from anxiety that is not my husband’s fault. This is just word vomit at this point, but I figured we could find support here."

18y14qg,Anxiety,2024-01-04,Burning mouth from anxiety?,"Hello! 

So I have really bad health anxiety. I’m normally fine but when my body is off, i’m off. So about a month ago I noticed a little mark by my lip and my mind immediately went to getting my first cold sore. It did burn, I went to the doctor and he said it didn’t look like one but could be, so he gave me Valtrex. It never got any bigger and went away quite quick. Now for the next couple weeks i’ve been having like phantom burning pains around my mouth, they switch spots, they feel painful on my teeth and gums sometimes, even into my nose! They won’t be there for a day and then will be again. My mind says i’m covered in cold sores but no bumps ever show up? I’m so confused and it’s really stressful as I am afraid of infecting my partner so we have not been kissing for almost a month! I’m just so confused and annoyed - anyone else with anxiety get this or does it sound familiar? When I look it up it says burning mouth syndrome or trigemenal neuralgia but I didn’t understand how I would get those out of the blue like this :/"
18y0zhn,Anxiety,2024-01-04,Cause of dizziness and dissociation?,"I have felt really dizzy and out of it the past week or so. My vision feels a little blurry and I have tunnel vision. I am wondering if you guys can please tell me if one of the three actions below may have caused this? Thank you!

I smoked two hits of a weed I have smoked before and had no problems with, and didn’t feel like this until 4 or 5 days after smoking. I only smoke once every 3 months and this is a strain that never makes me anxious or gets me too high. If my symptoms didn’t kick in until days after, is there any way it was caused by the weed? I hope not.

The second potential cause was that I had to take Benadryl three times over a day and a half, spaced out, because I was visiting my parents that have a dog. I have taken two Benadryls at once before and never had this feeling linger so maybe this is not the reason.

The final reason is I have been going most days recently not eating until around 6pm and then eating a really big meal all at once and that is my entire food consumption for the day. I also have been waking up at around 2pm. 

Could a bad eating schedule/intermediate fasting and only cramming all my calories into one meal be the cause of dizziness and dissociation or is it more likely that one of the previous two situations caused me to experience drdp symptoms? If it is the nutrition, could it take a few days of a better eating schedule to feel better? Thank you!"

I have health anxiety. I always have when Covid started I would wash my hands even though I was indoors and couldn’t possibly have gotten it from stuff that has been in my house longer than I’ve been lol. But now it’s at an intense all time high.

5 weeks ago I met someone at my university and she gave me a blowjob. Without a condom. Then we had penetrative sex with one. Immediately I started to worry that I caught an STI more specifically HIV. Especially when I got a sore throat at 2 weeks. I then got dry skin on my face for a few days and those all went away soon. Then 3 days ago I got really sick and had a fever, aching joints, sore throat, mucus-y cough, stuffy nose, diarrhea (for the last day probably from taking cold meds on an empty stomach) all that stuff. I just have a stuffy nose at this point

I have spoken to so many professionals and people on Reddit even that told me I am fine i am sick from stress, lack of sleep and probably a flu rampaging across canada right now. everyone is telling me im fine. but im just so anxious that i cant stop thinking about it. It feels like my mind is screaming I have it and another part of it is screaming back that I’m fine and it feels like my mind is being torn in two."

I'm not sure 100% how to say this but I'm 14m and have grown up around the Internet (since I was around 7-8) when I was about 8 or 9 I started a youtube account with me just being really cringy and just posting random stuff of me (not NSFW but just me and my old step brother messing around pretending we're massive youtube stars) anyway me and my step brother went out of contact after family issues and my youtube account I list since it was controlled by my older step brother (He controlled it because I had no idea how to make one since you needed a email and all of that stuff) like I was saying I lost that account and it got left on YouTube from what I remember barely any views or subscribers on it but I just ignored it.

We moved away from them and since I was around 11 by this time I make a tiktok account... a 11 year old making a tiktok account...  So the same stuff I did on my youtube I did on tiktok but just a less but still cringy videos not of me singing and stuff but just me with my skateboard or posting random shit but the problem was that with this tiktok account it was my name (I have uncommon name that from what I've tried looking for no one I have ever met has my name but I'm online 14 now so maybe later 🤷‍♂️) so after tiktok I lost that account as well and never saw anything of it. 

Fast forward around 2 years I haven't touched social media to create anything I just use like tiktok to watch, reddit of course and so on, I've had people from my current school find the tiktok account and send me it in my snap (Not a lot of people that I know or hopefully know have heard of my account just 'friends' I hanged out with during school) so after that I just shrug it off but deep inside it scared me that they could use it for blackmail and say stuff like 'Oh yea I'll leek this to the whole school' and stuff. Fast forward again this year my youtube account that somehow people got (One of my old mates I used to be friends with but not anymore because I realised they were idiots and around 2 other people ) got held of it and I can't do anything about it because I have no idea the email or the account name and same goes for the tiktok I have no way off logging into it. 

I don't really know what I am trying to say here just that I am really paranoid and scared people will find the account and do something with it even though there's nothing on it that they can use expect old cringe videos of me messing about."

18y0148,Anxiety,2024-01-04,I felt like a criminal today,"Well, this is going to be long…

I have had the same doctor for the last two years. She recently left and I was assigned a new doctor that I am to see later this month. 

I’ve been taking a low dose of Xanax (.25 as needed) for about a year and a half. I have started using less and less as I get more confident with managing my anxiety and now may use 30 in 2-3 months. I can request refills every 30 days but I only get them as needed. I also haven’t refilled since October (30 pills). 

I started getting low in December but was not too worried about it. The holidays come around which caused a lot of anxiety for me, resulting in me using some of my medication. Close to Christmas, I have one left and wait until the office opens back up last Thursday to request a refill. I explain I only have one left and ask if the refill can be prioritized…they said no. Okay, I understand.

I had a panic attack last night that resulted in me taking my final pill. This morning, I called again to check on the refill request and the receptionist was super apologetic and said she would mark it urgent. When I got off of work, I called to see if they were able to approve the request so I could stop by the pharmacy after work. She informed me that the (new) doctor said she would not prescribe me any medication unless I came in for lab work. I explained that it was fine but I had an appt scheduled later this month. They said it needed to be ASAP…okay. I go today and I find out that the lab work is a DRUG TEST that I also have to pay over $200 for unexpectedly (that I don’t really have right now). Fine, it’s got to be better than being so anxious about what I’m going to do if I have a panic attack! 

When the lab tech tells me the price, I request to speak with the doctor first. Why? Because I have a medical marijuana card for DC and will occasionally use medical marijuana, legally, when I am visiting the area. Of course, I was visiting the area over Christmas. I explain to her that I will test positive for marijuana due to this specific circumstance; she then accuses me of trafficking marijuana across state lines to my resident illegal state. I kind of laughed and explained again that I only use it there on vacation and because it’s legal. 

She then goes to explain that I was supposed to sign some kind of controlled substance agreement when I was originally prescribed the medication that explains they can drug test me and if I test positive for anything, they can stop prescribing. It also says I won’t sell it etc. She said this was supposed to be done a long time ago and periodically to continue allowing my prescription. I ask if that specific marijuana use is going to be an issue and she says she doesn’t know. 

Long story short, I paid $230 for what I know will be a positive drug test for something I did legally and wasn’t aware would jeopardize my anxiety medication. How could I have known when it was never disclosed to me? I did disclose to them about 6 months ago that I occasionally use marijuana (that’s when I got the card). And what really upsets me is there were no apologies for the delay, their mistake, or accusing me of illegal activity. 

Now I’m anxious as hell and I don’t know what to do from here. I don’t know if they will just stop prescribing abruptly or put me on a drug seeker list somewhere? I don’t want to be with this doctor after this regardless of what happens. I’ve been borderline panic attack the rest of the day and worried about being without medication. I would have even been okay with an emergency dose because just having it helps me to feel safe, even if I don’t need to take it. Is there anything I can do? 

When I move on to a different provider, am I going to be labeled a “drug seeker” forever because of this marijuana? My GAD diagnosis is documented so it’s not like the legitimacy was a concern. Please help. I’m panicking."
18y00o1,Anxiety,2024-01-04,Is this normal after a good streak,"Hi, I wanted to ask you about something that has been happening to me lately and I'm worried about the thoughts I'm having.

I have gone through an episode of depression derived from generalized anxiety as a result of having a great hypochondria and fear of the future. (This was in 2022, and the psychiatrist gave me the okay last month after a year with medical  treatment, I’ve been without medication since June)

Lately I have felt again that feeling of derealization that I sometimes felt. I don't feel comfortable with anyone, I feel different, unconcerned, like a third person who really does things for the sake of doing things. And it worries me not to give importance him, in case I am capable of doing some bad thing of ""so little worrying"" I do not speak of committing suicide, that I believe that I would not be capable, but sometimes yes that it comes to my mind to finish with I do not know, and it worries me.

It's been months since I stopped taking antidepressants and I am going to the psychologist monthly. 
Lately it is true that I have had some difficult episodes to deal with and I don't sleep too well. I think that could be a big part of the problem, since I was coming from a very good streak and I was feeling pretty good.

Is the way I've been going lately just a passing episode? It has been sudden and it has hit me hard.

Thank you all for your words"

18xyq4d,Anxiety,2024-01-04,Upper chest pain,"I'm a 21 y/o male, college student, no prior health problems, very active.

I developed daily anxiety after my first panic attack about 14 months ago. Some days worse than others, but for the most part, pretty manageable. Not on any meds &amp; don't plan to be unless some drastic change, but I go about my daily life with generalized anxiety &amp; I understand how to control it.

About 4 months ago I started having an upper chest pain, more frequent lately than usual. A little higher than the heart and in the middle of my upper chest, closer to my collarbones. It lasts for about 3 seconds, sharp pain, and either goes away, or it happens a couple more times every minute for a minute or two and then fully goes away till the next time. Usually happens during rest or after eating, usually not during workouts (I weight lift 3-5x a week).

I have a good diet, I'm 6'5, 230 pounds, never happened before I developed anxiety so I want to think it has something to do with that. I'm seeing a cardiologist next week to hopefully cross out any sort of heart problem, but before that I wanted to ask if anyone has had something similar? Any advice is appreciated"

I've been researching mental health for a long time now, espacially anxiety disorders, I have not been diagnosed yet, but I definetely have *something.* I have panick attacks, feeling like I've made a horrible mistake in the past regarding  anything tbh (depedning on my current obssesion), overthinking **all the time.** I feel impending doom, I procrastinate and avoid my triggers like crazy, I can't focus because I keep getting new thoughts about how things will go wrong or how they already are bad enough that there is no point in trying.

 It's honestly ruining my life, especially the last 2 years.

The thing is, I'm scared about medication, I've never been on any anti-anxiety or depression medication and I'm scared the trial and error period will make things worse and that I'll end up avoiding psychiatrists or just mental health care in general. I've noticed that certain lifestyle changes make things better but not better enough to stop looking for other options. **Even when I have a period of a week or two without any crazy meldowns I will still get at least a day when I feel like I'm not myslef, like I'm completely gone and just operating as a anxious sub-personality. - which I'm also not sure is healthy.**

Has anyone been succesful managing anxiety without meds? If yes, what were the biggest game changers?

I got my blood drawn and got a physical done. over the week ive had chest flutters, headaches, and what feels like a slight ""woosh"" feeling from time to time. the chest flutters and woosh feeling has gone away but the headaches still remain off and on. it started off as when i would bend down forward i would get a pressure/sinus headache now it's when i sit my head back, or go over a bumpy road i get a pressure headache in the back of my head or other areas (just depends) or, some times ill get random cluster headaches that feel like pressure behind my eye or on one side. i've also gotten sinus headaches where the bridge of my nose and forehead has pressure and my ear is clogged/hurting in the recent days.

i met with my doctor for the other health related anxiety about a week ago and she drew my blood. i didn't get an mri or ct scan but she said everything checked out normally the only thing is that i have a vitamin d deficiency. i thought that since the main thing i was worried about has been cleared the anxiety would go away. im not sure if the headaches are from anxiety, stress, or the vitamin d deficiency. the headaches are in random places and inconsistent, like over the christmas break (a week &amp; a half) there where a few days where i had no symptoms at all until i thought about them and then they appeared. 

this whole thing has had my anxiety on 10 and even when my doctor clears it i get worried about another symptom or life or whatever. anyone ever experience headaches like these?"

I was without a car for a couple of weeks, my dad was very helpful of my situation and we were able to replace my stolen car with another one quite quickly. 

Even when the insurance gave me money to replace my stolen car, I was very careful about what I did with the money. I was also too busy trying to reply my car that got stolen (my car note was $400 btw) and it was no problem paying for it while I lived at home with my parents but paying that+ my rent which is close to $1200 and me making barely $16 is almost impossible.

My dream is to create something, whether it be develop a video game or write a book because my two favorite hobbies are gaming and reading. I find myself feeling guilty for doing trivial things that aren't directly related to accomplishing my goals. This is especially the case when I spend entire days just relaxing and not practicing writing or studying game development as it feels like I'm actively crushing my dreams.

I got checked multiple times and turns out that I wasn't ill and that there was nothing physically wrong with my lungs. I'm a chronic worrier and a very nervous human, so apparently when I'm under higher levels of stress than what I'm used to I start having this dry, persistent and metallic cough that can last up to 3 or 4 months. It interrupts me while talking and doesn't let me sleep, it's even making me embarrased of going out in public. If I experience any remotely strong emotion [negative or positive] while on this condition I go into coughing fits that sometimes make me gag and vomit. Weirdly enough, when I forget about it it goes away, but the minute I remember it comes back to me. The only things I've found that actually help are valium, muscle relaxers and smeling vick's vaporub [though this last one only helps for as long as I keep it under my nose].

Today I am so sick. Stomach pain and diarrhea all morning and still going. I'll probably be in bed most of the day. 

I'm glad I got to do all those things yesterday. I enjoyed it despite the stress. 

Does this happen to anyone else? I've been trying to do more things, get myself out of the house and seeing people. I want to do it. I can handle the feelings of panic when I'm out. But I can't handle the stomach upset the next day. Like how am I meant to get my life back if I get sick everytime I do something? How do I get a job if I keep getting so sick and my stomach won't cooperate?

My girlfriend suffers from a severe case of anxiety over her body image; we're both on our early twenties, none of us have health issues related to weight and we don't have a high BMI, not above our normal rate.

However, due to her extreme case of anxiety, eating disorder and (toxic) parental pressure along her youth to maintain a ""healthy"" way of life (then again, toxic), she constantly battles with herself and her self-esteem. That manifests in the worst ways, further damaging her. I have no idea what to do, as I've never experienced what she goes through, neither have I meet anyone who does.
I try my bestest to be the most understanding person near her, but that doesn't help much to solve her issues.

I didn’t like scream or freak out or anything just my breathing got really shallow and my vision started to go in and out I felt like I was passing out. I also had intense ringing in my ear and felt like puking. It was probably one of the worse panic attacks I have had in a while. I don’t know why I all of a sudden got an intense fear of water. I know I have been having bad dreams about drowning and being submerged in water but I have never had a phobia of it. I have had a lot of tsunami/ drowning dreams before and it didn’t affect me then so I’m not sure why it is now..so.. how do I cope with it? I have places I need to go and I can’t just pass out when I’m near water what can I do to be less anxious?

I became a software engineer because of the money, because I am relatively good at it. This is not impostor's syndrome.

18xw1x9,Anxiety,2024-01-03,Does anyone else feel like they are too used to living with anxiety?,"I occasionally (once in a blue moon) will have moments that feel like ""Aha"" moments, where my emotions feel clearer and positive. I feel so flipped on my head that it causes me to question my hobbies, job, etc. a lot. Hobbies I can control, but job I struggle more with. For example, I pickedmy job because it piques my anxiety and thus, to my mind, it's attractive for me. It's not too overwhelming (well, I'm still working on reconciling that), but I would say my attitude is a bit rough. It's hard for me to just up and quit a job, though, and I don't have much education to move around.

&amp;#x200B;

It's just tough, though. When I have those moments, I'm like, what the heck am I doing with my life? It's a short-term flip of perspective, and it makes me feel lousy for making so many decisions in my life based off anxiety.

&amp;#x200B;

I have ideas in my mind of what I would be working in if my head were clearer. But, I feel stuck between following a short-term whim of clearheadedness or staying put and keeping in my little anxiety world where a hundred and one thoughts are sewn together in a net to keep me suspended.

18xvt8u,Anxiety,2024-01-03,Very slight but constant feeling of worry/ unease/ anxiety?,"

I (f18) sometimes have a day or a couple of days of slight worry/unease. I have had this for years, since a kid. Sometimes it had a cause, like when summer break was about to end or something. 

I have recently lost 30 lbs in the past 6-7 months. I have done it in the healthiest way for me. I am very proud of myself, I am finally happy with how I look. I eat stuff I like, I make my own food but if I am craving something I will adjust my day of eating and be content. Most of the time I am happy with this. But probably every few weeks, for a couple of days in a row, I get this slight sense of worry. I guess the fact that I have to be mindful of my eating gives me a slight second of worry for a second. That thought makes me worried even more. Why am I thinking like this when I am perfectly fine with the way I eat? I know I will have to be disciplined to gain what I want and I am perfectly fine with it. So why this worry? 

I know the obvious answer might seem like my weight loss or diet is the issue, but me experiencing this slight but constant worry has been occurring for since I can remember. The earliest memory of me having this is since the age of maybe 6-7. It happens for a couple of days and then goes away. 

I have posted about this on Reddit from an old account a couple of years back but I don’t remember getting any replies. Does anyone else experience this? Like I said, it’s a slight constant feeling but it’s in the back of my head. Something I think about all day, usually I watch a movie with my family to distract me. Is this normal?"
18xvort,Anxiety,2024-01-03,General question. How do you handle anxiety with motherhood and being pregnant?,"So I am not pregnant nor is there a chance I'm pregnant. But I do want to be a mom someday. I'm 30 right now. And my husband is very supportive. But like I honestly don't know how I can do it if I'm spending every waking energy, just trying to make sure I don't have a fucking panic attack so just asking for a general populace opinions on how they handle it has gone through it. "
18xvj1l,Anxiety,2024-01-03,Is this Anxiety?,"Hi - I'm hoping someone out there might recognize this story in themselves and be able to point me in some direction.

I have both physical and mental pathways to anxiety like symptoms. The  fundamental symptom is a sense of ""tension"" or ""zing"" in my central nervous system that just won't relent. From reading about the sympathetic/parasympathetic nervous system, I am pretty confident that my body gets locked into a ""fight or flight"" state.

This idea is also supported by my smart watch which rarely says I get a quality sleep (where heart rate variance increases; mine is locked tight). Another bit supporting my theory is that when I do \~10 minutes of deep breathing work, I feel the sensation dissipate, and my digestive system will start making noises, like its relaxing, unclenching, and starting to do its job; this tells me I'm transitioning out of ""fight or flight"". But I can't keep it that way.

This feeling is most problematic at night. I can't get to sleep until I do the breath work, after which I will feel my body relax and I will start to drift off. But the problem is the ""fight or flight"" comes back. I will wake up a couple hours later feeling stress in my system, and repeat the breath / sleep / wake up cycle through the night. In the morning I feel unrested. This ""acute"" problem will last for at least 2 days post exercise before diminishing but never totally goes away. On average, I sleep thru the night but still my smart watch says it was lousy sleep. And I feel wrecked.

The pathways / triggers: mainly, physical exertion. Relatively light exertion causes an over reaction of my heart rate. e.g. walking a stairmaster on a low  setting of 4  (43 steps per minute) producing  a heart rate of 118 (way too high for this effort). Even biking for 20 minutes maintaining a low 100 bpm threshold. Walking a flight of stairs can make me feel out of breath. My heart has become hyper-sensitive to any work load.

Prior to this state, a couple years ago, I was very fit, a cyclist, climbing mountains, heart rate training. Such small amounts of exertion would hardly be noticable. I'm not overweight or on any meds aside from seasonal asthma inhalers in fall/winter.

The other pathway, which doesn't produce as strong a problem, is mental intensity - a couple hours of FPS gaming, or blitz chess, for example, will give me the ""locked"" feeling but not as intensely, not acutely.

When I'm in an ""acute"" phase of problem, which only comes from exercise, other symptoms include a pounding heart, or heart that seems just a bit too strong, and sometimes a slightly tight chest.

I have seen my primary doc, a cardiologist, 3 neurologists, a rheumatologist, and done all kinds of blood tests. Nobody knows what's going, or finds anything.  My numbers are all good. I tested for chorisol / adrenal and they didn't find anything but.. I wasn't acutely symptomatic at the time of test. Would it matter?

Separately, fwiw, I have alopecia, an autoimmune problem, and tinnitus. I have a suspicion all this is related somehow.

As for environment, I don't feel like my life is particularly stressful in any way out of the ordinary, and certainly less stressful than when I was working (now retired). Indeed, I went thru some very stressful things working and in my personal life, so I read about PTSD but it just doesn't seem to quite fit.

I just can't be the only person in the world with this problem and yet none of the docs have any idea. So I'm looking here and everywhere, and appreciate any thoughts.

18xv8fp,Anxiety,2024-01-03,Constant Anxiety,"Question for you all,

So I had a moderate panic attack yesterday morning. 

I’m pretty sure my heart rate jumped to 120-140bpm

30 minutes later it was down to 100-110

30 minutes after, it stayed steady at 85-100 most of the day.

8:00pm last night it came down to 77 then around 9:00pm it went to 75 and went I went to bed it was 70-72

This morning I woke up and it was 62. I got ready for work, went to the store and it was 75. No big deal but after I got to work it jumped 85-100.

Why is this happening. My heart rate was fine this morning. Is this anxiety? Or is something wrong? If something was wrong wouldn’t it stay the same even at bedtime.

I’m at a loss right now and I guess I just need reassurance and advice if this happens or has happened to anyone else"
18xv7rc,Anxiety,2024-01-03,Anxiety about my career and a new job offer,"How to know whether a job offer is good enough?

Hello,

I’m 23 and I’ve been working as a marketing assistant at a property company for 2 years now. The company had a merger last year, and is set for a takeover of another company this year, so it’s growing. It’s my first job out of uni and I currently earn around £25k.

Last year I had severe anxiety attacks due to family issues and my work was suffering. I also have dyspraxia which didn’t help, and my manager threatened to put me on a performance improvement plan. There was a strong case for workplace discrimination against me too, so I started to look for other jobs.

I had a few job offers back in the summer, one of which was for a competitor for a substantial pay rise, but whenever I’m offered a job I get this wave of immobilising anxiety and indecisiveness. I eventually missed the deadline to accept the offer and ended up kicking myself afterwards. However, this week I got an informal job offer to work as a marketing coordinator at a prestigious university, for £30,500. It’s a step up in responsibility from my current role, but I know that I don’t want to work in higher education long term. Ideally, I’d want to work in software, tech or automotive.

I have improved at my current job over the last few months, and my manager has told me that if I continue to stay on track, they will begin to teach me what I need to know for a promotion. Despite this, HR have indicated that there won’t be immediate promotion opportunities until the end of 2024.

I don’t know what to do, and I don’t want good opportunities to pass me by and my career progression to stagnate. But, how do I know whether the anxiety that I feel is actually my instinct telling me that something isn’t right for me? Should I continue to wait for something better to come up in my job search?

Thanks"
18xuuq6,Anxiety,2024-01-03,Noisy Gut from anxiety,"This is my first time posting here. I am 21F who's been suffering from anxiety. One of the most common things that I have is touble sleeping on nights before university and sometimes, I keep waking up an hour or so before my alarm and keep tossing in bed. It is quite annoying because at that point, I'm not even sleeping nor am I fully awake. Other than that, once I'm in uni, I randomly get this feeling where I feel a sort of a heart beat in my stomach (sorry for my poor description but I hope it makes sense) followed by slight dizzines sometimes. Sometimes, I even feel my heart constantly racing and the deep breathing not helping any of it. Now, I think I have anxiety because of two main reasons: one is general anxiety I've always had even as a kid too sometimes nothing too serious and the other one where my mind constantly thinks about my gut issues. I got dengue back in 2019 and after that, I started having these gut issues where I'm constipated quite often and my gut rumnles a lot. Like AUDIBLE RUMBLES. it's so embarrassing to be sitting in a class and my stomach decides to roar. A lot of the times I'm quite gassy and i can literally feel the trapped gas making noises. And it's not just that I'm hungry, these noises happen even when I have taken breakfast. Here's the thing, I do think there is some general imbalance in my gut causing gas and constipation and discomfort but i also think that anxiety somewhat enhances these symptoms. If someone has something similar, please tell me what y'all do to stop these gut issues specially audible stomach rumbles because this is so embarrassing and emotionally taxing too."
18xut5z,Anxiety,2024-01-03,Why can’t I stop worrying about my apartment?!,"In the last 3 days, my landlord has:

1) Asked me for $100 dollars for the security deposit (this sounds weird, but there was a miscommunication when we signed the lease) - my former co tenant moved out so I had to sign a new lease which included a new security deposit which was more expensive because rent prices went up. The miscommunication involved the new amount minus the old deposit which carried over to this one

2) Asked me for proof of renter’s insurance even though I’ve sent it several times (are you not seeing my emails?!) They finally responded to my last email that included it.

3) Come to do requested maintenance but didn’t tell me they were coming. I have been coping with some life changes by drinking which I know I shouldn’t do, but I left out some empty bottles of expensive-ish scotch because I wanted to have them because they’re cool to me. Now I’m afraid the maintenance guy saw them and thinks I’m an alcoholic and I’m afraid they’ll kick me out?!?

I have run my register while having panic attacks many times, because RIGHT when I was about to take a ""bathroom break"" to calm down, someone just walks up to me. A few customers will notice that I seem ""off"" and may ask what's wrong and express sympathy. But most don't seem to care - in fact, they seem to make greater demands instead!

18x61q8,Anxiety,2024-01-03,I am too scared to sleep in case my 7 weeks old baby stops breathing in the middle of the night,"At the beginning of December my son (17 days old) was blue lighted to A&amp;E as he suddenly stopped breathing and went purple. Luckily, I was able to spot him turning purple before it was too late. My partner managed to get him breathing again during our 999 call. 

The whole ordeal was very scary and traumatising. As he had to be on oxygen; NG tube for feeding; and a line for antibiotics, and fluids. I had to sit there and watch the doctors try to put the catheter on my son several times in one night which was heartbreaking because of his cries from the pain.  It was confirmed he has RSV which meant we had to stay in the hospital for  a while. 

Yesterday, my partner and I had concerns that my son was showing the sane symptoms for RSV, which resulted to a 111 call and another ambulance ride to A&amp;E. 

Until yesterday I never really fully realised how much the the whole thing  had affected me. As soon as 111 told us an ambulance was on its way I felt so nauseous  and once I got in the ambulance and hospital I felt sick.  Even though my son has one of those breathing monitors I am still too scared to sleep. I constantly check my son if he is still breathing and too scared to drive in case he stops breathing and I don't notice it.

I always have flash backs of the night he got blue lighted as I know we could have lost our son if I didn't see him on time. I honestly don't know how to get over this or what I can do to at least reduce how anxious I am"
18x2ijl,Anxiety,2024-01-02,Trauma induced anxiety…,"So unfortunately, in early November I was raped by a registered massage therapist at a massage therapy/spa clinic from a reputable chain. Despite reporting to multiple authorities, he is still working as a RMT and a recommended provider on Sunlife. 

Since then, I have had a wide range of mostly physical symptoms. I don’t think it’s PTSD because I’ve never really had flash backs and I don’t even think about the actual event much at all. I’ve even gone for massage therapy since then (a woman and a different location, of course) and it didn’t trigger my anxiety at all- though I was worried it would!

My symptoms include:
- throat feels like it’s closing and I’m always aware of it, my tongue also feels too big for my mouth somehow
- heartburn
- constant thoughts and fears of death for myself and my loved ones
- awful eczema outbreaks on my hands
- tons of neck tension and tension headaches
- bathroom issues (constipation and thin stools sometimes)
- constant underlying fear something bad is going to happen
- can’t take a full breath
- super fragile; can’t watch any horror/true crime/sad movies 
- hypersensitive hearing, high pitched noises make my left ear feel like a blown speaker sometimes
- picking excessively at fingers 
- irritable/resistant to physical touch
- low blood pressure/blacking out when I stand up too fast (has always happened for me but increasing significantly in frequency)
- fatigue/lack of motivation 

… and things keep popping up. I’m normally a very productive and energetic person, I’ve been very unlike my usual overachieving self. Every scary new symptom I get, I google it and it says it can be caused by anxiety. Of course, these symptoms also terrify me into thinking something is gravely wrong with me, medically, and I go into spirals. I convince myself I’m going to get really sick from mundane things - was up until 2 am one night googling toxic shock syndrome. Exercise helps, as does eating healthy (whole, non processed foods) but it’s no longer cutting it. Therapy hasn’t really helped me so far. My therapist was hesitant to do EMDR on me because she thought my trauma should still be “fresh” since I need to report it to the cops and possibly go to court (which I don’t even want to do anymore 😭) I’m trying a new therapist in the new year. 

I did have really awful postpartum anxiety with my first child (2020 so very limited resources were available to me) but this is ramping up to similar levels. I don’t know what to do anymore.

18xsu0z,Anxiety,2024-01-03,Is this a backwards step? Opinions please,"So I've suffered with panic disorder and agoraphobia for 20+ years. Over this time I've had periods where I'm quite good, able to drive places on my own etc, but for the most part I rely heavily on my family for help with doing many things.  
My main issue is that if I'm too far from the car or out in a wide space my legs turn to jelly and I have trouble breathing. It then turns into a full blown panic attack because I feel like I can't get back to the safety of the car.  
About a year ago I started getting vertigo from loose crystals in my ear.. although I was treated for this I continued feeling floaty on my feet for some time so we bought a cheap wheelchair for me to use around the house so it was easier to get to the bathroom etc. I've used it a couple of times on dizzy days.  
During my first major dizzy spell my husband took me for a walk around the block (in the chair) and I was surprised to not have any anxious feelings. I felt safe and enjoyed my surroundings outside for the first time in years. Amazed by this new found freedom we bought a scooter (like the kind folk use around town lime etc) and we started driving it to the park so I could scoot around.. I can scoot to the other side of the park, which is quite big .. it is thrilling. I still can't walk from my house without getting jelly legs and headspins, so I don't feel like I've actually made progress, but I have found something that brings me some joy and a sense of freedom.  
Now the reason I'm here is this.. my husband and I have booked a trip of a lifetime to the UK and I am understandably pretty nervous about getting around. I want to be brave and do most things under my own steam because the car won't be too far away.. but there are a couple of places where the walk from the car is a bit of a distance... paved but far. (Stonehenge, Culloden) do I take my wheelchair (it's lightweight) so I can enjoy these things rather than waiting in the car and missing out. Or is it a step too far.  
I have a psychologist and I know he would tell me I don't need it but the reality is I would likely miss out if I try to just convince myself I'll be ok.

18xsh63,Anxiety,2024-01-03,Online Gaming Induced Anxiety,"I (32f) was diagnosed with GAD and social anxiety in 2008. 

I'm not anxious about playing the games online. It's when I play sometimes that I get the anxiety. 

When I was high school, my ex-boyfriend taught me how to play COD: Modern Warfare II (2009 version), which led me to playing with him and my cousin with COD: Black ops. That was great, had a bunch of fun and would always do well, and never had any anxiety playing. 

(At this point, I should say that I was on 100 mg of Zoloft from 2008-2011, it never seemed like it was doing anything.)

Over the course of the next couple years, I started getting anxiety whenever I would be in game, either from shooting the other team or being shot at. (Don't get me wrong, I can play FIFA and feel like I'm a little anxious, but nothing like playing a shooter.)

So, I stopped playing COD online for 6 or 7 years. Two weeks ago, I started playing Fortnite with my siblings, and everything was fine. I wasn't feeling anxious while we did duos or trios. Then I tried some solos and I thought I was fine until I was eliminated. My heart started racing, my hands were shaking, my face got flushed and just felt so entirely overwhelmed. I played a couple matches solo, and it was ONLY when I was eliminated that I became this way.

It's clear to me now that my medication might have been the reason I wasn't anxious playing years ago. I just don't understand how I'd be perfectly fine, mostly anxiety free when playing with a couple others, and then have such anxiety going at it alone. 

It's such a little thing to complain about, but gaming has always been a way I mitigate the stress and anxieties I may have on a daily basis. It makes me feel like I subconsciously need someone else to make sure I'm not getting anxious, and I don't want to be relying on others to avoid anxiety, let alone play a video game. "
18xscs8,Anxiety,2024-01-03,27F Struggling but wanting change,"I am your stereotypical first born Asian daughter (1st generation American).    I have been struggling with anxiety and probably some form of depression for a long time.  It's been progressively much much worse this holiday season as I've been dreading this increase in responsibilities at work.  That although I am highly functioning there- it's been wreaking havoc on my body.  I've never had a significant other- I have control issues because I can't trust anyone enough not to hurt me or use me. 

My bedroom is a mess and it's hard to workup the energy to clean or even take care of myself properly.  I desperately want to change but I'm scared of therapy and meds.  I wouldn't know what to say to a therapist.  I tend to manipulate my narritive when speaking to others about my problems. I'm afraid that the meds will ruin my functionality.  And there in lies the added issues of me making excuses for everyone and everything.  

I guess I'm just looking for some advice, maybe a little bit of a push, and some grounding into reality."
18xrzlh,Anxiety,2024-01-03,Butterfly feeling,"Does anyone else get a weird, almost excited or happy butterfly feeling?

Idk if this is anxiety or just something weird, but the last couple of days, I’ve been feeling almost happy, but like, not for any normal reason. It’s been a really bad couple of days, but I’ve been noticing also a feeling that’s more similar to excitement? I may just be feeling this because I used to attribute indigestion to happiness due to substance use, but I get this weird butterfly feeling. Idk how to make sense of it. It’s still bad and I’m still very nervous, but it’s like, the feeling you get before a first date.

Idk why though because there’s nothing I feel this way about in my life. I’m a woman who is ovulating so could that be it? My arms have been tingling and got an abnormal EKG at urgent care.

Does anyone else experience this?"

I've been in a rut for coupleoff months now but at this point I get uncomfortable even about the thought of studying and i feel like theres something seriously wrong with me.
I get nightmares about studying and yet still CANNOT bring myself to do it.
I need to do something about it because my exams are coming up.
I was just thinking about big i fucked up this time and now i cannot move in fear. 
I don’t know what to do or how i can fix anything. I just want to disappear.

18xqj6d,Anxiety,2024-01-03,Question to Males with an anxiety disorder?,"Greetings, everyone. To keep it brief, I was chatting with a male acquaintance of mine who shared a belief that confused me. He stated that he thinks his anxiety disorder prevents him from being attractive to women in general.

During our conversations, he shared a few examples to illustrate his point. He believed that he wouldn't get approached by women at parties, but the same was not true for work events or social gatherings - there, women barely acknowledged him and did not attempt to strike up a conversation or make any comments.

His usual routine involves putting in a lot of time and effort to meet women online, but after their first meeting, he never hears from them again

His dating history reveals a pattern of only lasting three dates with any woman before she disappears from his life, if he's lucky enough to even make it that far.

He believes that his anxiety could be causing him to experience symptoms like premature ejaculation, even though he doesn't necessarily have a diagnosed condition. He struggles to perform well in bed, with his maximum time being under 5 minutes or sometimes even just 3 minutes.

I'm curious if other men have gone through a similar experience. If so, how did it affect you and how did you overcome it?

18xq7r6,Anxiety,2024-01-03,"I've got no-one, 18m","I took a gap year, I got the grades to get in but I couldn't find anywhere cheap to live for uni, so very last minute I decided to spend a year working. What I didn't realise though is that it'd mean I'd meet no new people, I only had the people i already had, and even then the majority of them went to uni far away too. I just had two left that I talked to at all. I've never felt like we were best friends (I've always been reminded by them that they are already best friends so I can't be) but we did lots together, we'd go out, go on trips that kinda thing. Although they've always been closer, they have a sleepover once a week together, work at the same place, everything, whereas I would be lucky to meet them more than once a month. As one of them was going to a uni close by they asked me for help at the start of term with how to get the train there, so I helped we did a practice trip there together just us two and started talking a lot more, it got to the point where everyday we were talking from when we woke up to when we went to sleep, a couple times we went out just us two too (of course we could never tell the other one we were doing that as we couldn't leave them out like they left me out a lot). Me and them talked about their problems too, I helped them open up more and get help, and was always told that I can always talk to them about anything. Occasionally the third would find out how much we were both talking without them, they made it out to be such a big deal that we were leaving them out of our conversations, how they thought they were being replaced. But a month ago it all kinda changed, just one day (happened to be a day I first told them I was not doing that well mentally that day) they kinda just went really dry and stopped talking to me, the only time they did talk to me was if it was about their interest, and even then it was only twice, everytime I tried to talk to them it made me feel like they didn't want to talk to me anymore, I was always the one to send the last message. We haven't messaged in over a month now, the only time we talk is in a groupchat with all three of us, and even then it's awkward. I had paid for a trip for all of us and it took them basically 2 months to pay me back (all the while them telling me how they're getting paid from work) I mentioned it to them and they just brushed it off. Most of the things we do are things those two want to go do, see their concerts, see their films, go shopping for them, I go along because I like seeing them, I said last week I wanted to see them today, I didn't know what to do though, I even thought just us sitting together and talking might be nice, but a couple days later they message saying they have both got what they want to do and I'm coming with them, and then they say it's a romance film with many sex scenes in it, not my thing at all. I say I'll go but then on the day I just really don't want to, we'd gone to a film before together and they really made me seem like I wasn't enjoying it or anything, I was left to be the one on my own, I back out of this one then get asked if I wanted to drive them to a shop to get something to say hi at least, but the thing that got me is I'd be dropping them both back at one of theirs for them to spend the night together, what a way to tell me they don't want to see me. I've always been more a person to become friends with women, and as a man I thought that I was always left out of coming round, or staying the night together because I was a man, but idk, I'm increasingly being left out of even having an evening together, and I don't have anyone else to talk to. Idk if they used me to help them get to uni in the first couple months, I always plan anything we do, the concerts were going to see I booked them all, I planned them all, I am the one that drives. There have been times when they are sleeping over and they call me because they need help fixing their laptop to watch a movie together. Idk what to do, I've not even got a message from either of them to ask if I'm okay, all I'll see is that they are both active and talking to each other, I'm always left out.

I’ve had a CT scan of my brain, getting an MRI next week, currently wearing a heart monitor for a few days, starting physical therapy, been on 10mg Lexapro for 3 months (doesn’t seem to be working). The doctors say I’m fine— I just have anxiety, maybe some benign vertigo from who knows what. But then I’ll have something like elevated RBC show up on my blood work, which google of course says is some rare type of cancer, even though it can be caused my dehydration, anxiety, benign genetic factors, etc. And then since I constantly feel so crummy, I assume it must be because of an underlying condition, rather than anxiety. I’ll never be appeased. No amount of reassurance will ever reassure me that I’m actually fine. I’ll just find something else to fixate on. I’m scared all the time, constantly thinking about my health and anxiety and just waiting on some terminal diagnosis. I am 28 years old (male) and otherwise healthy, apparently. But then I read posts about how doctor always write off symptoms as anxiety or it took years of pushing to get a real diagnosis and I’m afraid the same will be true in my case. I don’t know what I’m asking for, just venting I guess. I’m tired of feeling this way. I’d rather just find out there’s something actually wrong with me so we could treat it."

I fell once and hit my head and immediately thought “this fall was harmless, the next will have me in the hospital” so Igot off the ice and am too anxious to try again. 

I broke my arm roller skating last year so I don’t want to pick it back up either.  

I’ve been described as a mermaid but am now terrified of drowning and undertow so I’ve stopped swimming. 

I am an artist who hasn’t finished a personal piece in years because I hate the feeling of zero confidence or the fear of public rejection (I don’t agree with “just draw for yourself” rhetoric because I want to share what I draw, I want my work to be seen, keeping it to myself makes me just as unhappy). I only illustrate for work now and drawing/sketching causes mental and physical anxiety. 

I can’t window shop or go to restaurants and just enjoy myself without public panic attacks, which are worse than private at-home ones because they’re so fucking embarrassing. 

Even dumb stuff like playing a video game or board game or reading a book these days leaves me feeling anxious that I’m not husseling enough and wasting time and money. 

Nothing makes me happy anymore. It all makes me anxious and depressed. I’ve been in therapy for several years. It feels like i plateaued and the healing is as over as it’s going to be.

First of all I have never taken any drugs!

I got this 2 months ago because of extreme stress and anxiety. I had soo bad headaches (squzzing,tension,brain zaps,ice pick)

I have anxiety and depression for 6 years now. (21M)

Now Im Feeling like my nervous system is ""FRIED""
What the Fu*k is this? I feel STUCK! 

Symptoms I have:anhedonia, cant focus and concentrate, Im here but not here,life seems like a bad dream all the time, everything looks fake,night feels more empty and darker,cant feel ahappiness ""inside me"", even my emotions feels so fake...its hard to describe. 
I can only feel anger inside of me...I just wanna live.

Im 101% sure it is a brain damage...I didbCT scan, blood test, EEG, almost everything and everything was clear. But still thinking its a brain damage.

I got prescribed Seroxat(Paroxetine) and Xanax

Seroxat didnt help at all which is REALLY REALLY weird.
Xanax helped (for headaches) only.



Is there any type of pill/antidepressant, supplement which can help?"

18xpfgx,Anxiety,2024-01-03,School anxiety,"Just thinking about going to school gives me anxiety, going to every class and having to speak in class. I took a nap in the evening today and I woke up thinking it was morning and I woke up late for school. I had a terrible panic attack, I felt like my heart was beating out of my chest even though if I know if I missed a day of school, nothing would happen. 

It’s like I can talk normal at home but in school my voice becomes so much more quiet especially in this one class when I try to answer a question. My brain cannot even focus on questions most of the time because I feel like I have to be alert of everything happening because of my anxiety, and I feel like I am trying to compete with people who just yell out the answers so my brain is working overtime to get the answer as quick as possible and it turns out to be wrong. If I do manage to think of something I always assume I am wrong, when there have been a few times I was right. And I am so jealous of people that can ask dumb questions and talk as much as they need to without becoming quiet and worrying about what other people think.

I’ve been getting stress rashes and headaches because of this (and I have semi important exams coming up) and I have horrible sleep anxiety, I know I am anxious because of school but it is so much easier to blame my headaches on the fact that I only got six hours of sleep last night, or the reason I shouldn’t try to answer questions in class or talk to other people is because I didn’t sleep well last night so I don’t have the energy for the effort, or some excuse like that. So I get stressed out of I don’t finish my hw or don’t study and do my chores in time for bed (basically if my day isn’t perfect). I honestly don’t know what to do, I found that I get frustrated at myself if I happen to be slightly imperfect and I kinda get annoyed at the people around me too if they’re not perfect either, I know I shouldn’t, I just don’t know how to stop."

18xot71,Anxiety,2024-01-03,Hyperthyroidism is ruining my happiness at the moment.,"30/m from UK. Please see below:

I am someone who has had social anxiety my whole life as well as Hypothyroidism. My thyroid issue has generally been good through my life as I am carefully monitored with blood tests. Recently, My thyroid levels have shot up to high after taking 200mg of Levothyroxine for 3 months following my pharmacy’s advice. Now they want to bring it down to 75mg. Most of my life I’ve been taking 75mg to 100mg of Levothyroxine so I felt it was quite odd to be told to start 200mg.

Anxiety: This is bothering me the most. My anxiety has shot through the roof in the last week so much so I had to go to the Emergency room. They checked my blood pressure and confirmed it was high. They did an ECG but never gave me the results or didn’t feel the need to. All that doctor said was he thinks it’s my high thyroid levels and the sudden and dramatic change in Levothyroxine dose. He ended it saying he is not going to give me anything and that I’m going to have to wait it out out for a few weeks. My family doctor did a blood test just before all of this happened and confirmed my thyroid levels are high. Thus, she told me to take 75mg Levothyroxine rather than 200mg (I was taking 200 for the last 2-3 months) and that she will do another blood test to monitor levels. It is like I have someone else’s brain - I am getting very strange intrusive thoughts about suicide and calling myself a loser for living with my parents at 30. Before, I never thought about suicide or cared whether I am 30 and living with parents. I am thinking about how I haven’t saved up properly and that my life is over. Because of this anxiety, I am reading constant Reddit posts and YouTube videos about if I should worry about living with parents or not and I do see alot saying things like, “If I was living with my parents at 32 I would commit suicide” or “If you are living with your parents in your 30s you are a life failure” and I even forced myself to watch a video of Jimmy Kimmel putting down someone for living with their parents. 

Vision: My vision goes blurry (noticed when I am working) and that in turn is making it harder for me to focus or care about my work.

Tired/Insomnia: I am feeling very tired all the time. That said, I am not sleeping very well at all. In fact, I probably got 4-5 hours of sleep in the last two nights. 

Confusion: I occasionally feel disorientated and confused as if I’m living in a simulation. It is a very strange and unpleasant feeling. 

I feel like a junkie. I am constantly worrying about every single thing. How I envy older people because they are going to die sooner than me. I was on Xanax and Risperidone before and I was not thinking the way I am now. I want/am coming off all anxiety medication because I don’t want to keep taking them. It’s confusing what is causing my extreme levels of anxiety if it’s withdrawal from the two medicines or it’s because of Hyperthyroidism or the sudden significant change in Levothyroxine levels. 

Please any assistance would be much appreciated because I am genuinely crying inside. I don’t feel myself at all. I love my parents and brother a lot and they love me and have done everything for me and so I feel guilty feeling like this. I want to continue living with them because I am just happy with the support network. I don’t have hardly any friends and so living alone would really impact my mental health. I’m just torturing myself reading those Reddit posts or watching those YouTube videos because it just makes the problem worse.

How long will it take for my Hyperthyroidism to subside to normal? I have been taking 75mg for almost a week now."

18xofh8,Anxiety,2024-01-03,Things to improve on - tips and thoughts are welcome,"
Hi.  
I suffer from health anxiety and it affects my life quite a bit. I don’t really suffer from anything else anxiety related (no problem with crowds, people or going out). As for many other, thoughts and “physical” symptoms spark quite a bit of them. What I hope from ranting about some of my thoughts is to hear other people’s thoughts or tips (maybe you have encountered same and did / did not do anything special to improve upon them). 

I’m bad at eating and have been for some years. It’s been pretty bad the last year or so. I don’t know much about dieting at all. I tried calorie counting and it was hard for me to even hit 2200 kcal, normally 1800-1900, but I should be around 2500-2600 for my size. 
I have an idea it affects my blood sugar quite substantially and therefore my mood and energy levels. 

My HA says stomach issues over and over again and I want to think it’s just HA. I often encounter discomfort, bloating and changing bowel movements. Some nights i can’t sleep because of them hurting - maybe correlated to my bad dieting. 
Maybe it’s just HA all along and I want to believe that. I really do, but there is / must be things I can do to maybe lessen the symptoms (other than medication and therapy). Most of the things I think about, I don’t know if it’s even any good or “worth it”, but also what to do precisely. Some things I am so clueless about and have no idea where to start.

Exercising for example is not optimal. I don’t do much other than grocery shopping here and there. I once cycled, but now with HA and bad diet it’s hard to be energised well enough. 

There also comes really bad posture and neck pain. Maybe these introduces new symptoms for me. I suffer quite a lot from brain fog and the feeling of “about to collapse”. Some days is better than others, but they usually come up regardless. It’s annoying because you feel like you have 0 brain activity in there and it’s about to shut down. I know it isn’t, but I question wether it’s anxiety related or my bad diet, posture / neck pain, exercise or I’m sitting too much still. (I’ve been “sick” from school 2-3 months now and I’ve not done much). I do want to improve on just some of these things. I just don’t know how or where to start.

18xo9gb,Anxiety,2024-01-03,will quitting drinking help get rid of my physical anxiety symptoms?,"hi i (21 m) recently developed anxiety, and even with therapy and medication i still find myself struggling every so often with soreness in my chest during times of being anxious. it's not life altering or rarely does it even affect my day to day but it is something i would like to get rid of. i have a few drinks a week, rarely ever get drunk but i've always enjoyed a good buzz and never noticed an increase of my general anxiety around the days i do drink. i've read a lot on this sub reddit how quitting drinking was  a game changer but i'm just curious if it could help with the physical symptoms. my mind is already able to recognize anxiety and calm down pretty quickly but my body doesn't seem to follow unless i'm completely preoccupied with something. i've also been to the doctor for multiple times since my diagnosis to make sure there are no underlying health issues and everytime i have been told i'm very healthy. i know it sounds stupid, but i don't want to just quit something i enjoy doing with my friends if it really isn't going to do anything."
18xo99b,Anxiety,2024-01-03,"I need opinions on my symptoms (dizzy, lightheadness, can't focus)","Hello everyone,  
I'm writing this post because I've been suffering from considerable anxiety every day for almost 2 years now, and my physical symptoms have changed quite a bit in 2 years, which has created real health anxiety for me. And despite several blood tests, 2-3 trips to the doctor who tells me he doesn't see anything strange (I haven't done any tests at a cardiologist's, although I plan to), I can't believe that my symptoms are only due to anxiety and not to a real illness or health problem. 

  
Here are my symptoms:  
Dizziness (the biggest), confusion, lightheadness, feeling of seeing differently, weakness, brain fog, feeling like i can't focus with my eyes, and sometimes I really feel like I'm fainting (although I've never fainted).

  
Sometimes it happens when I'm exerting myself, but sometimes it just happens when I'm sitting down. The times when it happens to me most is when I leave home and have to get to an activity (a party, a date etc.). Overall, whenever I see friends, for the first 10 minutes I don't feel well, like I'm going to faint (even if I hide it from them), but almost all the time I manage to get better (and alcohol helps a lot too... unfortunately).  
I hardly ever do sport any more, but when I do it on my own I have the same symptoms, but recently I did a muscle-building session with my brother, and if at the beginning I had trouble, the rest went well.  
Sometimes these symptoms are more minor, sometimes they are so strong that I cancel outings... Every time they happen, I'm terrified, as if I'm going to die, as if my heart is going to give out.   
Everything suggests that it's just anxiety, but I just can't believe it, my symptoms seem too present and powerful to be just anxiety...  
I'm writing this to find out how you feel about my situation, and if other people have similar experiences, to tell me what they've done to help this, how they've overcome these symptoms...  
Thank you very much to those who took the time to read, and have a happy new year 2024.

18xo4vo,Anxiety,2024-01-03,Wife suffering from sever post partum,"Good Afternoon, as i said my wife had our baby in mid november. everything seemed fine in the hospital but when we got home she started experiencing severe anxiety and insomnia on top of caring for our two children. We have great support from family offering to watch kids or stay with her when i am at work. OBGYN started her on Zoloft 25mg to no effect. one day about a week in they told her to go to the ER where she was given ativan to help her sleep. about 2 weeks of 25mg did nothing so she was upped to 50mg zoloft and then 100mg a week later. she has some moments that are better than ever but for the most part she is having a very hard time dealing with everything. she occasionally takes an ativan to help her get a few hours sleep but she does not want to rely on drugs to get rest.Now after 6 weeks of varying doses of zoloft she does not feel it is making a difference, possibly even worse.

I do not suffer from anykind of anxiety or mental health issues so at times it is hard to understand but i do y best to support her. I am a fan of doing everything as natural as possible. I ordered Sugar Bears Sleep blend that should arrive today. I have also heard CBD is helpful. 

I am interested in hearing from others who are going through this, have conquered it, or from those in the same position as me supporting a loved one through something they cant relate to. thank you all"
18xo12m,Anxiety,2024-01-03,Does anyone have any tips &amp; tricks on decreasing sensory overload?,"Every time I have a panic attack, for one or 2 weeks after that I experience sensory overload a lot.

The most annoying way in which it manifests itself is that I have a hard time looking at screens. Sadly I work on a computer.

During my previous episode I discovered a small trick to decrease it which was working behind a standing desk. No idea how it works but it slightly decreases the sensory overstimulation so my nervous system winds up slower.

But still it's really tiring. I have to do guided meditations after every 2 hours of work to decompress. I have constant tinnitus, my jaw is clenching.

Does anyone have any other tips on how to deal with this and how to make it go away faster? "

The endless obsessing over whether it’s healing, the sensations, the bleeding, the worry about infection.

Right now I have that horrible panic feeling of “I can’t do it OH GOD I CAN’T DO IT”

18xmasi,Anxiety,2024-01-03,Need help about medication,I have struggled with anxiety the past 3 years now and have been going to a therapist for it. In September my anxiety got super bad and started to really affect my everyday life. I was extremely hesitant about taking meds so I didn’t start it till yesterday. I took fluoxetine 5 mg yesterday but am a little concerned. I had to build up so much courage to begin taking the meds that I was counting down the days to start. But when I took it yesterday my mind was telling me “oh I don’t need this I’m not anxious rn I feel fine” and I’m feeling the same way again today so I’m scared to take it because I don’t want it to mess me up. Has anyone ever felt this way?
18xm5i4,Anxiety,2024-01-03,A Had A Really Bizarre Panic Attack While Playing A Video Game With Friends. I'm Humiliated.,"I honestly don't know why I do this, but it isn't the first time. I don't know why this happened; I don't know if it's anxiety, trauma, autism, a mix of all three, but it was so awful and humiliating and I hate myself for it. 

My group of friends dragged me to play Minecraft last night, a game I don't normally play but I figured I'd give it a shot just for them. I don't dislike the game or anything, it was just never my cup of tea. Despite that though, I played a game mode with them. It was cute. It was like a super hero game mode. 

There was one point however where something just really bad happened. There was a certain way to fly your character and everyone else was able to do it no problem, but when I did it, I kept crashing and dying. Like, I just couldn't figure it out at all; no matter what they said I just kept crashing. The first time I crashed my friend laughed, and that's when it started. 

My body started becoming tense and numb, I couldn't speak and I couldn't move. My heart was pounding out of my chest and everyone was there and the one person was trying to teach me how to do it and I was just sitting there unable to react. I felt so much pressure and I felt like I was never gonna get it right and that I was just humiliating myself in front of everyone. 

I suddenly just dipped the game and because I was host it stopped. I can remember everyone was super quiet when I left. They asked me if I was okay and I told them I needed a few minutes. It was humiliating and so degrading. I felt like a complete idiot. My love interest was there and the fact that he saw that too made it so much worse.

Afterwords, in a few minutes I did calm down. I apologized to all of them and they were completely understanding. Still, it didn't stop me from feeling really really embarrassed. Has anybody else ever dealt with this before? I don't know why I do it, but it wasn't the first time. It's happened before. I just crack under pressure so fast and I just freeze unable to do anything. 

I'll be telling my therapist about it tomorrow but I wanted to just spill it somewhere because it's been heavily bothering me."
18xlvv7,Anxiety,2024-01-03,"(F23) No matter what I do, the anxiety never goes away...","I have had anxiety, more specifically social anxiety since I was a kid. Always have had a very low self-esteem, no confidence, etc. Always struggled meeting people, connecting with others my age, etc.

I'm not on medication for it &amp; am unableto even get some. There have been times where I've been able to get a grip on it. But lately it's just getting worse. I'm in college now and starting a new job and my social anxiety is just paralyzing - I feel like I can't think clearly, panicked, stuck, major headache, everything! And I often feel all this within social interactions too, which I often can't even talk in front of my peers! It's awful and I end up feeling more stupid. 

I just don't know why it won't go away, no one else seems to understand. I practice self-care, being mindful, try to have a good lifestyle and mentally work through it, but nothing helps anymore. I am like a deer in headlights and then feel like my heart will stop or my head will explode with the panic. 

How can I stop being so anxious and panicked with people??? I feel like I don't even know myself. When I get up to talk or even present in front of others - I feel transparent. Like they see right through me. It's just wearing on me a lot now and I feel stuck."

 I look into wfh jobs because I’d rather stay at home and not have to look for transportation to and from work plus I’d just like to stay at home. And I’ve looked into warehouse jobs but not being able to wear headphones would really suck and worsen any anxiety I might have.

18xjr77,Anxiety,2024-01-03,Panic attacks and change in the brain,I had an accident at work back in May of 2023 where a big dog kicked me in the thyroid. I started to have severe panic attacks after that. I had severe anxiety for 4 moths or so before it started to get better. I'm not sure if the accident at work caused the anxiety attacks. But my anxiety has been rooted in health anxiety. Since then I've been experiencing a lot of physical pain and am getting a lot of tests done to 1. Calm my anxiety and 2. Getting tested for fibromyalgia. My mental health has been iffy. I've been wondering if the panic attacks has changed something in my brain because now I feel different. Like I'm in a different body with a moderately different mind. Or that I'm still stuck in the all consuming anxiety of my body feeling different (without the physical symptoms of anxiety) that I'm detached from the world around me.

If anything it made my anxiety worse. I did end up sleeping some. Anyways fast forward I took another before bed the same night to avoid what happened the night before and same thing. Anxiety worse. I fell asleep and woke up one time with really bad night sweats and my heart felt funny. I can’t describe it because I was half asleep but I woke up multiple more times throughout the night with anxiety. Is this normal?

Recently some personal things have come up in my family and its basically doubled my anxiety even though I live very far from home. On top of this, the hours I work make it difficult for me to have a social life (working late and shift schedule). As a people-person this has also made my anxiety worse and energy lower. 

Last night, my anxiety was so bad I couldn't sleep.  I get really anxious calling out but I just didnt feel well enough to do my job properly (for reference this is the second time ive called out in 6 months). I think the chief thought I wasnt really sick and was just trying to get an excuse to get out of work. When I called again as she told me to do, to let them know I was feeling better, the night chief scolded me about not calling earlier. 

My anxiety has been so bad I felt like a break was needed to help make it better, but instead, I think it made it worse. I was so anxious the whole day and still am that my coworkers don't take me seriously anymore and are mad at me for calling in sick. 

Does anyone have any tips on how to balance work when your anxiety is really bad?

&amp;#x200B;

Also for reference, in the work environment I'm in: clocking in on time is late, clocking out on time is early (its typical to do an hour of overtime everyday-if you leave on time you're ""lazy""), and I think my other coworkers probably call out twice a year if that so..."

I was there for 3 days and got my potassium back to normal however, when i got back home my anxiety started i thought it was normal because I was just discharged from the hospital. I was thinking of would it happen again or does something new might happen to me. It was always present everyday, i felt the same numbness during my attacks, my hands and feet was always cold and felt like i need to puke or need to go to the bathroom. Until i decided to talk to a counselor/therapist to help me because it was really affecting my day to day i dont want to move so much or do something because I am afraid it might happen again. Also  it got worst because I used to google symptoms that my body feels and we all know google has all answers and it makes you want to believe that you also have that kind of sickness. Im about to start my 3rd session of therapy and i still do felt anxious sometimes. I feel like i have been avoiding it and the more I avoid my anxiety increases.

18xh5cw,Anxiety,2024-01-03,Why did I suddenly get anxiety attacks while doing something that's never been a problem?,"I went out skiing with my dad today, same as we always did. Last year we went skiing a ton and it was really fun and there was never any problem.

Today though, as soon as I got on the chairlift I got something what I can only assume was an anxiety attack (I never got something like that). I was breathing heavily, clapping my limbs together and was just really afraid for some reason. It's like I was afraid that the lift would crash, and I just wanted to get out of there. My dad was able to calm me down somewhat and nothing bad happened.

Now I'm afraid that if I go on the chairlift again I'll have a similar experience and maybe do something stupid like jump out. I don't understand why this happened, it makes no sense. Maybe it's because I'm mentally in a worse spot than I was previously? I've been trying to get out of my shell and socialize more, which has definitely made me more anxious, but I don't get why that would suddenly make me afraid of chairlifts."

This usually goes on until my body is finally relaxed enough until I can finally fall asleep. Apparently this is a common thing with anxiety but every once in a while this happens, I get really really close to falling asleep, almost like I’m already asleep, but when I jolt awake like usual I get this very heavy, numbing, dizzy, fully body tingling feeling usually accompanied with some sort of visual snow and racing heartbeat. It kind of feels like I’m having a “stroke” or “seizure,” or what my anxiety thinks a stroke or seizure is like. It’s feels like I’m about to fall asleep, or maybe i’m already entering my sleep cycle, but then the anxiety jolts me awake and my body is still in sleep mode so it leaves my brain being active while my body is still half conscious. I’ve heard the jolting awake thing being normal with anxiety but never heard about this. Does any else have this or know what it could be?"

So anxiety has been a part of my life for several years. But lately I have been struggling with major panic attacks that have come out of nowhere. Heart palpitations and blurred vision. Everything has been “ruled out” by doctors. The past seven days I went to the ER, had 3 incidents of a severe panic attacks that feel like I’m going to die. It feels like I get swept by an ocean and feel the impending doom. In my mind I know it’s just a panic attack but I freak out and don’t know what’s going on with me. I know the answers (somewhat), and I’m coherent enough to understand my symptoms. I’ve going through the following changes in the past 60 days:

- Moving out of state, I’m sick of Texas 
- Cut off contact from my family that is a HIGE source of my trauma 
- Break up after 5 years
- Heartbreak  
- Travel for work, rarely home the past 7 months. (Physically alone a lot)
- alcohol consumption

frist of all , happy new year :)

I wanted to ask you people if your anxiety and anxiety based health issues dissapear while travelling?
Everytime I travell warm countries and lay at the beach I feel like the person I used to be before anxiety.
My mind is just not thinking about my hypochondric disease.
I feel so alive and good.
A little side note: I don't have a stressfull life so I don't think it's because I calm down.

Does somebody has made same experience?"
18xg95m,Anxiety,2024-01-03,Klonopin versus Xanax?,"Does anyone know the difference and if one is more effective? Klonopin has helped in the past when I’ve had to get Pap smears. I have severe doctor anxiety and vaginismus and most doctors don’t give a duck and shove it right up there while my body is clenching for it’s dear life.

Anyway, it’s not working as well now even though I never take it. Maybe that’s just how severe my panic has become. I’ve been wondering if Xanax is any different?"
18xg2aq,Anxiety,2024-01-03,Do you let your anxiety attack just happen or do you try to prevent it?,"I'm currently having a pretty severe attack, and I know I am because I can't stop shaking and my muscles are so tense, it's so hard to walk. I feel like I'm going to vomit and shit myself simultaneously (and almost did) and I'm currently avoiding waking up my boyfriend. On a scale of 1-10, I'd rate this one an 8. 

I don't know if I should just let it happen or if I should keep trying to prevent it. I hate the way I feel when I have attacks. I cry uncontrollably, my body feels like it's ripping itself apart, I'm so cold yet so hot and sweaty, I can't keep my jaw from fucking clenching. And I cannot stop fucking shaking. 

Idk man, I just want it to stop. I was fine an hour ago. I was just fine and now I'm like this. I don't want to have the attack but idk what else to do, nothing is helping. I'm so tired of feeling this way, I just want to be fucking normal."

During my training, I have learnt techniques to help adults with a range of anxiety disorders such as mild depression, recurring moods, stress, phobias, lack of confidence …
As part of my course, I am required to conduct and submit case studies.  When conducting a case study, I will be putting into practice techniques I have learnt on the course.
I would love to work with the people of this community hence I am looking for a volunteer who would like to make some changes in their lives in the areas mentioned above, and benefit from learning some techniques. 
I need to run these case studies on the basis of one session a week or so. The first session will last about 90 minutes followed by 5 sessions of 1 hour according to your specific case (more if needed). All sessions will be done online using Teams (you only need a phone or computer with a camera + and a quiet spot in your place).
I will assess suitability once you get in touch, and I will send you a few documents to fill out (won’t take too long) so I can better prepare for the work we will be doing together. Amongst these will be a “case study agreement” which will give you more details about the therapy process.
Send me a message if you are seriously interested. Based in UK so bear this in mind if you are interested. I look forward to helping you."
18xf0nz,Anxiety,2024-01-03,Travel anxiety got so much worse since Covid,"I have always loved travelling, to me getting out and experiencing another culture has been the best way to handle my death anxiety. However when Covid hit and travel stopped I didn’t think anything of it, I figured once it was over would be business as usual. 

However now travel gives me huge anxiety, not even that I worry about getting sick or getting stuck somewhere but just generally the flight makes me anxious, the planning makes me anxious etc I have been one a few trips since and enjoyed myself when I was there but the lead up is bloody awful and I can’t for the life of me figure why things have changed so much"
18xeynf,Anxiety,2024-01-03,Anxiety and possible health issue,"I'm a 19 year old female, I've always struggled with anxiety, ever since I was a child I would overthink the worst possible situations.

 However, a week or so ago I experienced a panic attack. It felt like nothing was real and I was beyond scared.

The days after that panic attack, I began to worry about my health as my arms started tingling when I would wake up or go to sleep. I started let it affect me so much I completely lost my appetite.

I'd like to note that my goal is to gain muscle, and not having an appetite made me more stressed out because I wasn't eating. 

Anyways it became so bad I went to the ER and they prescribed me with medication for Anxiety. Which I'm not surprised cause I know I've had anxiety my whole life however I've never had anxiety or a panic attack until now.id also like to note that my dad had anxiety with his health when he was in his 20's as well. 

Today however, I went to my doctor and he doctor said everything looks fine and I'm young and healthy, he did say he wants to check my thyroid. I'm really anxious about this. I never been to the Er or a hospital before my visit. I've always been healthy, the only thing I have is anemia and that was cause of my poor appetite before leading up to the panic attack. I also have issues sleeping now, which I have never had, making me think it's my thyroid after googling things and reading things on Reddit

. Has anyone ever experienced this? Can anyone give me tips on how to overcome this?"
18xehrw,Anxiety,2024-01-03,"Got a private doctor appointment (UK), what should I make sure to ask?","I have a private appointment online in a few hours because I want to sort myself out ASAP and don't want to wait weeks for a GP appointment. However the service I'm using is kind of lousy from my experience (which is a given considering it's only £40-50). Last time I used it was solely for anxiety and all he basically did was just prescribe me propranolol and that was it, I was too anxious to properly advocate for myself. So this time around I want to make sure I am asking for the right stuff.

I plan on going into the appointment and telling the doctor that I have two interlinked issues; anxiety and alcoholism. I will specify that I want to completely quit alcohol and therefore am interested in diazepam (which I've read is helpful for combatting withdrawal), I then will tell the doctor that I need something long term for my anxiety that isn't just beta blockers as I find them only to be a bandaid and that sorting my anxiety is fundamental for me ending my alcoholism. However I am not really sure what I should ask for which is why I'm on here.

I have been reading about SSRIs which the NHS website says is what a GP would usually recommend but I'm not sure which will suit me best, nor am I sure about the requirements to get prescribed them (they can't really test my blood over the phone if that's required).

Could anyone give me any advice that will help me properly advocate for myself during this appointment? literally any advice is appreciated!"
18xe9c3,Anxiety,2024-01-03,Shortness of Breath related to Anxiety?,"Hello everyone,

since November 2021 I have Long Covid, before that time I was perfectly healthy. For the first half year I had breathing issues that faded. One year after that, in June 2023, the breathing issues came back suddenly. I was driving my car and from one second to another I had the feeling that I couldnt breath anymore. So I thought it will go away again like last time, but it didnt. I had a gastroscopy and have GERD and a small hertial hernia, I had a heart MRI and had some inflammation, but very little (the dr. said that cant be the reason) and small vessel issues but only with stress. The thing is, the breathing issues are also present when I am not walking or having a high heart rate. Its there 24/7.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, that could explain parts of the issue BUT: When I wake up, the first 2-3 minutes my breathing is perfectly fine. Also Ativan and Alcohol makes it better (doesnt go away but its tolerable then). 

&amp;#x200B;

I dont feel the Anxiety in my brain, i feel like its only in my body. As I already do meditation and breath exercises, I dont know what else to do. I am trying an SSRI now but those didnt work in the past. I am also fasting and trying to get rid of my GERD which is hard as i am not feeling heartburn. Maybe you guys have an idea what I can still do to make it better. I cant exercise due to my heart and the breathing issues anymore but I do around 10k steps a day. I cant work anymore as sitting makes it worse. I am basically laying around the entire day or walking around trying to breath. Its crazy. 

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you guys and have a great new year!"

I told her that the surface of my shoes was dirty because of what I said at the beginning of this text, and she told me not to worry since people would have to wash the clothes anyway when buying them. I warned her, and despite her comment I am still worried about whoever buys the clothes. Am I to blame for this situation? I feel like I should do something about it.

I was offered a supervisor position within a few weeks in from being hired. I took it because the $2 extra seemed worth it at the time. Well fast forward to now, I am having bad anxiety. I can’t sleep at night, I wake up feeling panicked, I am in fight or flight constantly, I get manic (cleaning) episodes when I’m at home and finally I am always upset or snapping at my husband. I have tried to step down but my job is making it a bit hard plus I need the extra $2. I wanted to know if anyone has had to cut their hours/days just to get some sort of relief from being at work 5x a week/40 hrs a week?  Should I get a doctors note? Originally I wanted to ask my doctor if I should lower my hours to 30 a week. But that would disqualify me from the supervisor role since I work 8hrs minus 30 min for lunch daily and I would have to stay and work 5.5 hrs if I had to cover for someone.

It just feels like I’m having a bad high even though I don’t smoke. I try to tell myself it’s just anxiety, but then I’ll have some chest pain, or head pressure, and then I’ll freak out and think I’m going to pass out or faint. I never have fainted, and I was told that if it was a heart condition, I wouldn’t feel “light headed” all day. My doctor said it’s impossible to be light headed all day. Can anyone relate?

I have recently lost 30 lbs in the past 6-7 months. I have done it in the healthiest way for me. I am very proud of myself, I am finally happy with how I look. I eat stuff I like, I make my own food but if I am craving something I will adjust my day of eating and be content. Most of the time I am happy with this. But probably every few weeks, for a couple of days in a row, I get this slight sense of worry. I guess the fact that I have to be mindful of my eating gives me a slight second of worry for a second. That thought makes me worried even more. Why am I thinking like this when I am perfectly fine with the way I eat? I know I will have to be disciplined to gain what I want and I am perfectly fine with it. So why this worry? 

I know the obvious answer might seem like my weight loss or diet is the issue, but me experiencing this slight but constant worry has been occurring for since I can remember. The earliest memory of me having this is since the age of maybe 6-7. It happens for a couple of days and then goes away. 

I have posted about this on Reddit from an old account a couple of years back but I don’t remember getting any replies. Does anyone else experience this?

191n1m7,Anxiety,2024-01-08,Anxiety is beating me.,"Hi everyone :)

I doubted if I should tell this story in OCD or anxiety community but I feel like this community will understand my symptoms and thought process a little better.

In 2021, I was a relatively normal person, I had occasional anxiety but it was always manageable and nothing that ruled my life or anything even CLOSE to that. In summer of 2021, I drank a very large amount of coffee (I know it’s not as “crazy” as some serious drugs but well…it did its trick on me) and at night I started shaking &amp; twiching.
I immediately thought that it was a seizure or something like that and ever since, I developed an ongoing fear that I was epileptic (spoiler alert: I am not)

Long story short, I had that fear from 2021 to winter 2023. A week ago, that fear kind of faded away even though it was a part of my everyday life and at some point even ruled it.

Well, immediately after that fear died down, I read somewhere that anxiety and ocd (which I suspect I have) can lead to guess what?-psychosis and schizophrenia.

So me being me, I immediately knew this would become my new obsession. Now, for over a week now, I’ve been googling symptoms of schizophrenia/ psychosis, applying it to myself.
That also made me experience dpdr pretty heavily (It always gets triggered when my anxiety is high)

I know that this is not even somewhat normal way to live so I booked an appointment with a psychologist but before I get an official diagnosis I wanted to ask people on reddit 

1) have you ever experienced something similiar?

2) does this look like schizophrenia to you?

3) does it ever get better…?

Thank you!"

This will be my first time meeting the new team and it’s important that I show face. I used to fly constantly and never thought twice about it but one trip really freaked me out/ I’ve been a nervous wreck since. I find myself flinching at every bump, or praying that the pilot is a happy person. If you can worry about it, I do. The last time I was supposed to do a short 1.5 hour trip I intentionally missed the flight last minute and chose not to board. I know the stats show that flying is so safe. And everything has its risks. One of my goals for 2024 is to overcome this fear because I do love traveling. 

Anyone else had a similar experience? Any tips or advice is appreciated."
191buqi,Anxiety,2024-01-08,Weight lifting stopped my anxiety,"I have suffered terrible anxiety since I was a child. Last January I hired a personal trainer because I didn’t like how scrawny I looked. After about six weeks I noticed I wasn’t holding on to irrational thoughts. I remember telling my friends there was some sort of miracle that happened. I didn’t correlate it with working out. I spent eight months with the trainer and seven amazing, worry free months! I stopped going due to the cost and after about two months of not lifting my anxiety was back. I start at the gym again on Tuesday. I didn’t think it was possible to live without anxiety and a taste of it is too good to let go. I’m sure that this doesn’t work for everyone, but just wanted to share my story. I did google it and come to find out there are studies that show weight training can reduce anxiety. Obviously check with your doctor. (My anxiety made me say that) ;)"

I'm a functional adult (teacher lol) and support my family financially. But yes, I'm a degenerate.

Something traumatic happened October 2022 which caused my anxiety. I noticed I no longer do recreational drugs just for fun. Iy is a form of escapism. I do it more often and in larger quantities than ever. When the first sip of alcohol enters my body, I know my purpose is to get incredibly fucked up so I don't have to deal with the reality of the present. I'll spend the next 12 hours on a diet of nothing but alcohol, cocaine and xanax. I've wasted so many weekends like this. 

I'm trapped in a vicious cycle of being anxious, abusing substances to rid of those feelings, and the comedown fuelling my anxiety. How many times have I said ""I'm not drinking anymore"" just for the same shit to repeat itself the following weekend? 

I cannot afford to fuck up my life - I have a younger brother who is autistic and requires full-time care, and a mentally unwell mother. I've got a postgrad offer from one of London's most prestigious universities, it's my key to giving my family the life they deserve. I can't go to this programme fucked up. 

Am I on the road to addiction? How do I break the cycle? Is it possible to overcome anxiety fully?"

190s3oa,Anxiety,2024-01-07,Seeking Feedback on Medical Community Acceptance of Long Term Benzo Usage,"I have had anxiety issues for 38 years, and for much of that time I have been prescribed either alprazolam or lorazepam.  Both have been very effective in handling my anxiety, by ramping me down as a panic attack begins / accelerates.  For the last decade I have been prescribed 1mg lorazepam, and am given a 90 day supply.   Never in that time have I taken more than the prescription.  Never in 38 years on benzos have I increased my dosage.  In my opinion, benzos have worked wonders for me, and I wish to continue to have access to them.

Recently my doctor has removed my access to lorazepam, citing unspecified studies of harmful long term usage.  I have been like a zombie for the last month, barely able to leave the house because my panic attacks have been crippling.

Has anyone else been in this position?  Is there a way for me to change my doctor's opinion, or seek a new doctor with a different perspective on long term benzo usage?"
1904yea,Anxiety,2024-01-06,Did anti-depressant withdrawal ever make you question your progress in overcoming anxiety?,"I was on Effexor 225 mg for about a year and a half and then tapered off of it while getting on to zoloft (went up to 100mg).  Zoloft wasn’t cutting it, and my therapist suggested that maybe it was time to fully go off of any depressants given my progress in the past year and a half and that maybe it was time to fully go off of antidepressants given my progress in the past year and a half with learning to manage my anxiety. I was only on 100 mg of Zoloft for about one month and I started tapering off of it. I took my last dose of 12.5 mg four days ago and the withdrawal effects are pretty rough. My anxiety is heightened. I’m more irritable I cry at random times And I have very negative thoughts. It’s not always like this, but it seems to come out of the blue at different points throughout the day. 

All of this is making me question whether or not, I actually did figure out how to manage my anxiety or cope with it in a more healthy way because I feel that my anxiety has just skyrocketed instead. For those of you who managed to successfully get off of antidepressants did you return to your original anxious self?"
18z9cdk,Anxiety,2024-01-05,I keep feeling judged at work and beat myself up about it. What can I do?,"I work in a fairly competitive, fast paced company and I’ve been there for a long time. Often, after a big presentation or discussion with big bosses or a large group of colleagues, I will playback what I said and start to feel judged and stupid, e.g. I didn’t answer the question well enough, person X frowned when I responded, he probably felt my answer was bad, I shouldn’t have said it this way, I could have chosen another better example…….. the list goes on. 

I know a lot of it is likely self-perceived because my career seems to be going ok and regular people don’t go around thinking about others all day, they are also just thinking of themselves. However, I can’t stop myself feeling this way. On bad days, I yell when I’m in the car alone because I feel awful inside. On occasion, I’ve even slapped myself in the face multiple times because I felt so stupid about what I’ve said. The feelings usually pass after 1 to 2 days until the next event where I feel like I mess up again. 

The worst thing is I’m not even that ambitious where I’m looking to climb the corporate ladder and hence want to be better than everyone. I’m just so impacted by (real or imagined) perceptions of others.

Anyone experiences something similar? Would love to hear how I could help myself feel less like this."

Or like, someone doesn’t have a big enough tank for their fish and they get called an animal abuser. people make mistakes. people fuck up. and i cant imagine the people throwing stones are as perfect as they expect everyone else to be. a gentle correction is one thing, but people are frothing at the mouth on here. there’s an angry mob around every corner just *waiting* for you to screw up. i have this image in my head of the average “online person” and they’re so righteous and noble. they like, only eat organic, and they donate to charity every week, and their dog eats venison or some shit. i feel like a worthless piece of trash in comparison."

For context, I have terrible anxiety. I have had it for years. I've done therapy but never been on any medication.  It has helped a bit but I feel my brain is just honestly fucked up and it doesn't know how to apply the coping mechanisms that I learn.

My father died recently and since then I have been depressed and anxious all in one. Idk what to do.  I want to plan the future to include my current boyfriend but he doesn't seem to have any distant future plans in mind. We recently moved out of our shared apartment and he is just staying with my family until either he gets a place or we both move out.  We were making plans to buy a house together. But I am worried about whether or not he is going to leave me.

But I also need to make sure my mom and brother are okay in light of my father's death but I want to continue living life with my partner but I don't want to rush anything for anyone.

18xal8p,Anxiety,2024-01-03,Anxiety over prion diseases are killing me,"Hi, I'm a 15M from the Philippines and I was wondering if I have SCJD (Prion Disease)The day before I had the symptoms were normal, nothing interesting happened and I stayed up until 3:00 for New Years. The day after that, I began experiencing the first symptom, lightheadedness (could be physical tiredness but it's my first time experiencing this) when I stood up from my chair whilst watching a short about prion diseases in deers. At the time of writing this, it's January 3, I still have that physical tiredness/lightheadedness but I'm certain its caused by my anxiety. (I once worried I had rabies from a bat that probably didn't exist lol)I just have a few questions to ask:- Is dizziness an initial symptom to SCJD?- Can my anxiety cause symptoms like weak legs, tired mind and body, twitching?- Is it rare for prion diseases to occur in 15-25 year olds?

This could be my anxiety at work but I want some reassurance or clearance because I'm struggling to eat and do normal stuff

Update: I kept on shivering after waking up in the morning despite it not being cold at all and it's not stopping. I also have muscle twitching and the urge to move my body maybe from anxiety. Scratch dizziness, it's more like tiredness (maybe mental tiredness?). I also think I have jerky movements ;-;"
18xaaq7,Anxiety,2024-01-03,Please read,"I am so stumped and defeated. I need advice. I go to so many doctors appointments and get so many tests and they all come back pretty much normal. I got back on depression medicine after being able to not be on it for years and was able to go through the worst time in my life without the assistance of medicine and just therapy. I will give you guys a timeline. 

October - It started in October with a ear infection, it was incredibly mild. I was dizzy, brain fog, tired and just didn’t feel well but the dizziness made me anxious. Finished the antibiotics. Symptoms persisted with ear fullness but no pain, I felt like I couldn’t focus. 
Went to urgent care, ER , vestibular physical therapist, ophthalmologist, primary care physician. 

November- ALL symptoms still persisted but my anxiety got worse, everyday I was dizzy. Nothing I did made it better. I was drained and felt like this for a month. I got another round of antibiotics for the ear infection that I still had. I felt like I was in a constant state of fight or flight. It was hard to move and hard to do things because of the dizziness. 
I was so worn out about trying to find out what was wrong and nobody could find anything so it started messing with my mental health bad. 
Went to ER 2x, urgent care, vestibular physical therapist. 

December- this is where things really started to ramp up. Dizziness continued (of course), anxiety, couldn’t focus, incredibly tired, lack of motivation, no longer felt like eating as much. I laid on the couch and cried for days because every doctor I went to made me feel like it was all in my head and all I wanted to do was feel normal again. I finally and reluctantly decided to get on Wellbutrin and buspar (I was on it a couple years prior) and still kept having symptoms but the mental symptoms like intrusive thoughts and sadness really dulled down which helped. But I was still tired. 
Then one day the dizziness calmed down significantly to the point where I barely notice it when for months it was all I thought about. However the other symptoms continue. 
Went to primary doctor 2x, ENT, audiologist, physical therapy, chiropractor, psychiatrist. 

I am so beyond at a loss for where else to turn. It’s obvious the symptoms are not all in my head but it does wear on me mentally because I have yet to find answers. I’m trying any doctor that I can and I’m not looking for any sympathy I just need advice, help any type of information that could point me in the right direction. 

This is the reason I came to Reddit, for advice and joining groups and listening to people who have gone through similar things and I’ve tried to find the correlations and seek answers but I’m not sure what to do now. I have a neurologist and endocrinologist appointment for this month to try to see if they give me any more information than what I already have. I will be posting this on other groups too"
18xa8vk,Anxiety,2024-01-03,How do I get better if I am legit afraid to take anything to help me? Long post but need advice.,"My brother passed away when I was in college. I had zero anxiety ever and then began panic attacks. It knocked me really down and I was prescribed medicine (which helped) and used alcohol, marijuana, and more so avoidance for YEARS. I went on and off medicine. Got super sick every year. Put on adderall, put on antibiotics bc of how sick I was, and lastly was put on Wellbutrin. No one ever told me to workout and try therapy just shoved pills down my throat. Which sucks, but I was just at fault for not trying other avenues.

It was here where bad anxiety got 100000 x worse (after Wellbutrin for 3 months). It worked GREAT at first but then it led to cluster headaches which scared the SHIT OUT of me in the middle of the night. I developed pretty bad OCD and trust issues with doctors and some people. It also led to permanent migraine issues and stomach problems for MONTHS after which is still present but not as bad. Even more than I already had. I vowed to never take another drug and I haven’t. I drink and smoke weed on VERY rare occasions. Thats all. During Covid I lost 30 pounds, was happy/healthier than ever, and then I took a job that was very stressful and gained everything back. Migraines were still present and OCD was too.

I can’t sleep well. I grind my teeth. My jaw is stuck in permanent stress position. Therapy works but not doing the job. I am told I’m great at what I do and feel like I couldn’t even work as an Uber driver (not knocking it but my confidence is nil). I have NO release. Working out doesn’t do it (helps more than anything). I used to smoke weed as a release and I think it truly did help but I fear I have some form of CHS due to my previous awful nausea. Ketamine worked but that’s the ONLY thing I’ve tried (which was a miracle in itself) and I hated doing it bc I’m injecting drugs in to my veins. The only reason I did is bc it’s in and out and I did a TON of research. I have adderall but I’m terrified to take it. I’ve even been to naturopaths and refuse their recommendations bc I honestly think they just want money for sugar pills that could also make me sick or give me an allergic reaction.

I’m at a loss. The only thing I haven’t tried is mushroooms. Which I really want to try. But I’m so scared and that’s a long time to journey. I would do this legally if I did it.

Point is, wtf do I do. I’m a lovable person, dad, husband and son. And I get out of bed with no energy or drive. I try to workout and it just makes me even more tired. I’m happy but I’m unhappier than ever and it’s SO subconscious idk wtf to do. My moods are up and down and I just hate it for my wife and kids. I want to BREAK my chains. Any advice?"
18x9vp6,Anxiety,2024-01-03,Idk what to do tbh,"Hey ya’ll. I’m new to this group. I’ve read different posts with others who deal with anxiety. I just wanted to share my experience with it (in this moment) and I just want some advice + to see if anyone deals with this.

I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety about a year ago. No one really prepares you for how you’ll feel after the diagnosis. I felt hopeless, and my life isn’t the same. I went into the doctor’s office for a very different thing. I had chest pains and shoulder blade pain in my right arm. Thought it was a heart problem, but my vitals were fine. My heart was pumping sufficiently. Also went to the emergency room to get tests done and it was the same thing. Nothings wrong.

Lately, I was in a stressful situation at my home. I had to go back because school was on break, and I didn’t want to be alone. During the break, I spiraled a lot. I cried. My back was hurt so much that I couldn’t find comfort in sleeping. Now that I’m back at school, my back has totally relaxed more than it did while I was on break. However, I’m having other health issues. I can’t sleep. Everytime I try to fall asleep at night, I feel impending doom. Like I jump out of it and I’m scared to go back to sleep. I get cold feelings in different places in my body. It feels like I have butterflies in my chest and stomach. My heart feels fluttery. I want to laugh and cry. It’s awful. I even go breathless when I lay down. 

Has anyone else experienced this? I want to go to the doctor, but I’m tired of being viewed as “crazy.”"

I’m 24, a farmer, have a beautiful wife (22), we live in a nice enough two bedroom house with our two dogs. I have always dealt with anxiety from when I was a kid, going through school being tubby and all that, but now I just feel like I keep making mistake after mistake that will ultimately end me. 

I’ve made poor financial decisions, which I’ve worked myself to death to fix and make up for, and now 3 years on they still bite me in the ass.

I have no friends, as my constant panic attacks have lead me to being more drained at the end of the day/week than I’ve ever been before and I haven’t seen anyone outside of work but my wife and her parents in nearly 3 months. 

I’m not even sure how to totally explain this to you guys. But it’s the feeling of just knowing I’ve got to get up each morning and repeat what I’ve been doing for months with no change that’s really been getting to me. I don’t seem to be getting anywhere and every couple of weeks I get my hopes up thinking that I really gave last week my all and I’ll be able to get ahead come this week and maybe get a weekend off to go on a trip with the wife, but there always seems to be something that appears to bite me in the ass, wether it’s a 500$ fine from 3 months ago the mailman forgot to deliver to me or someone’s spreading rumours or the boss forgot to order enough fert, so I’ve got to drive 14 hours to get it. There’s always something to put me back in my place at the bottom and I can’t for the life of me figure out how to get out from under it.

PS. The reason I tend not to let my wife in on these thoughts and hide any sort of panic attack I have from her as I am her only source of support out here and I love her with all my heart. I’d never dream of letting her see me in the state I’m in right now as it would take her structure out from under her and I can’t do that to her."

I know that medication is a solution to this but I don’t want to to give up, as I know meds can be addicting and hard to get off.

Anyone here have success stories of getting thro w/o meds? How long it took them to get through a time like this? If meds were necessary and good idea? :(

I can’t even look forward to doing anything bc everyday I wake up feeling like shit. I can’t even plan for travel, etc. I need success stories and inspo please! It’s been the longest month of my life and I don’t want to continue 2024 this way.

18x8xgq,Anxiety,2024-01-03,"Severe anxiety about asbestos exposure, please help","TW: cancer related fear

We had the floor replaced in the front half of our house back in 2022. The contractors who did the job exposed a lot of black substance that I now assume is black mastic which, due to the age of our house, probably contains asbestos. It's not dangerous if left alone, but they were sanding it down (which is the worst thing you can do as it causes the asbestos to become airborne). At one point I could see visible dust in the air at the front of our house. As far as I'm aware, the only safety precaution they had in place was that they used a HEPA vac to clean up the remaining dust on the floor.

Asbestos exposure can cause mesothelioma, and it usually doesn't show up for 20-30 years after the initial exposure. I'm TERRIFIED that my house has been contaminated and that I have been breathing in the asbestos fibers for over a year now. I had a breakdown a couple months ago because I was convinced I wouldn't live past 40. Some people on the internet seem convinced I will be fine, while others tell me I'm doomed. I don't understand the vast difference in opinion here.

If anyone has knowledge of asbestos or mesothelioma could you put my mind at ease, I could really use it. Do you think I am overreacting? How can I cope with thinking I am a dead man walking?"

My anxiety in the past 2 years branched out to an almost constant deal. I had food poisoning for the first time in my life about 3 months ago, and since then, I damn near don't eat, and when I do, it's a quarter the size of normal. And if I try to eat more, I'm so scared of it messing me up that I start to get more nauseous the more I eat. I also will be nauseous the whole night till I'm able to fall asleep, and normally by the next day I'm fine. The only things I can do in the moment to help me sleep is take hydroxyzine and or go for a drive for about an hour. I normally drive somewhere quiet, let my anxiety attack do its thing, then drive back. 

I also have inner ear issues from head trauma, and my anxiety can make me feel like I'm experiencing a mild vertigo episode when I'm really not."

18x7zgr,Anxiety,2024-01-03,Does this sound like some form of anxiety?? Brain zaps/elevator falling feeling…,"
Hope this is ok to post I also posted in askdocs…some of this may be repetitive but want to highlight I’ve never been an anxious person or had major anxiety…when these things happen I don’t feel anxious either so it makes no sense. 

35f. 160lbs, non smoker, 5’5, I have asthma and take  symbixort and ventolin, omeprazole for acid reflux and serc for vertigo

Just as title says I’ve been getting these recurring sensations where I’m just sitting still and for a split second it will feel like the floor is falling out from under me. It’s also reminiscent of when something super startles you and burning moves fast for a second. I have vertigo but it’s controlled and these sensations are nothing like it at all. Other times it feels like a zap or a jolt in my brain that literally makes me jerk my head. 
I’m having trouble googling this because every thing I read says either anxiety/stresss or coming off of anit depressants (for the zaps specifically) I have neither..I’ve never been on anti depressants of any sort and I’m really not stressed or an anxious person. Not to mention these spells occur in the least anxiety inducing situations ever like sitting on my couch while the kids sit and play or just at my desk at work. Even laying in bed reading and relaxing they will hit. It’s never the traditional “got up to fast” or anything either. 
I just had one a few minutes ago and now I feel headachy and a little dizzy but nothing crazzy. Normally after these my heart will race I’ll feel “off” then it’ll be fine. 
I’ve gone probably 7 months without feeling these and now it’s been like 4 in a week. Early 2023 I had a few spaced out over a couple months sprinkled in with a couple “vasovagal syncope’s”. I haven’t had one of those since may either. I’m honestly at a loss. I’ve had all the tests… eeg, several ekgs, an echo, two holters, 2 Ct scans and an mri. They also did an ultrasound of my neck for what they thought was pulsatile tinnitus (I can super hear my pulse when I’m laying on my side like woosh woosh woosh). 
So I’m squeaky clean and healthy which is great…but no answers or ways to stop them.  I also eat well, do spin classes and lift weights leisurely and have a decent job/low stress/great family. I’ve been asked to up my sodium/electrolytes which I do. I’m well hydrated and have balanced the electrolytes. So WHY do these little “fits” keep happening? What can be done? All my bloodwork has been okay too. 
I don’t know if this is relevant either but I also have these little issues with random parts of my body twitching or going numb for a couple hours to couple days. For example my left pointer finger is mildly numb/feels heavy and has been for a couple days. My left peck muscle was twitching the other day to the point where my heart felt like it was spasming. This happens randomly too to my nose tip, lip, eye brow, toe, shin etc. either twitching or a numb feeling. 
I’m at a loss. After how frequent the syncopes/brain zaps were last year I finally stopped being afraid of them hitting me at random/dangerous times and now they’re back."

18x6xqz,Anxiety,2024-01-03,Terrified of Brain Damage,"Hi,

I’ve had this issue for a long time and it’s got worse. Whenever I’m having a conversation with someone, I imagine they are about to punch me at any moment. I had it since I was a kid and my dad used to hit me when he was mad. He would suddenly switch from happy to enraged. Since then, I always, always imagine that a person will suddenly hit me no matter who they are. Man or woman. It’s scary and one of the things I’m most frightened of is brain damage. I read every day, I taught myself French and music theory, but I’m scared it will all be taken away from me. I sometimes won’t study or attend lectures because I think the chances of everything being lost from brain damage will grow due to this. It doesn’t make sense.

How bad would the brain damage be if I were concussed? Can I put my mind at ease by understanding I wouldn’t lose all of my brain power? I’ve seen physical fights at work where people had their head stomped on by groups or were physically knocked unconscious. I’m terrified I’ll be next. I hate violence and always have. Even the nicest kids at school would run to watch fist fights and I hated it. I thought they were hypocrites. I never watched because it was brutal.

What can I do to reassure myself of my safety? Should I start boxing so I understand being hit won’t ruin my life entirely?"

18x6vf9,Anxiety,2024-01-03,Fatigued and can’t eat.,"So for about the last month I can’t seem to eat, and when I do I find I get full very quickly. In the last few weeks I’ve been getting fatigued, even after sleeping a full nights rest I’m still so tired or just the thought of sleep seems refreshing. It started when I had a health scare. (I had blood in my stool) which hurts my a stomach a bit when it happened and had cramps. Since then I’ve done many stool tests, had blood work done, did an h. Pylori test, 2 xrays, an ultrasound on my bits, 2 urine test, a ct scan of my body, and a mono test. even when I’m not feeling as anxious it persists, is this at all common? Btw I’ve been to known to be a hypochondriac and have had a bout with health anxiety before leading to about 6 months of physical stmtoms.

18x6vcu,Anxiety,2024-01-03,Problems being touched by others…,"

Never have a let myself be alone. Even when I was a child I had problems with loneliness, even when people are around me. I needed comfort, love, human touch; yet I let no one touch me. I’ve never liked to be touched, I pull away from hugs even with my family. I tolerate hugs from friends, but in actually I will never feel comfortable with others hands on me. 

If I look back and think, where could this feeling come from? 

Haphephobia
The fear of being touched.
It has a name. Once you can put a name to something then you’d be able to pick it apart. Wrapping my head around this was and is very hard. Thinking to myself is this going to be something that I can actually fix? Something I’d be able to use exposure therapy for? Can I just walk up to people and let them touch me or hug me. I think not. My OCD compulsions have taken over my life. 

Mysophobia
Is the fear of germs. It sends shivers down my spine just thinking about being dirty unclean, untouchable. Having the outside air touch my skin causes me great distress. It hasn’t been this bad in a long time. I’d been properly medicated for years now. Even been with a therapist for three years, Until she retired. 

Where do I go from here. 
I honestly have no idea. I know I can’t go back to my old life, my old habits, my ex. I have to keep pushing myself forward and keep my head high. But on days like today, it’s easier said than done."

I still don’t understand what happened to me. I had to do some breathing methods I learned from yoga in order to calm down.

I think it's also loneliness. I live by myself, and although I have great friends, I miss the connection with my work mates (who are great) and often over Xmas my friends go away, or are busy with their family, so I see far less of them.

I was having a normal day, I was in my car as a copilot and then I started to feel like I couldn't breathe, I guess I started to panic... My chest was hurting, I got nauseous and felt like I was going to die, I got home and laid on the bed, my boyfriend told me it was probably because I hadn't eaten anything since breakfast, it was like 2 pm. I started to eat and then I started to feel bad again, I rushed to the ER and everything was fine, they told me my blood pressure was a little bit low. 

Then exactly a week passed since the incident and I started to remember everything and felt bad again, actually, this time was worse, I was shivering, and even my teeth were trembling. I rushed to the ER again, and everything was fine, my blood pressure was normal this time, they did an EKG and I got sinus tachycardia, but nothing to worry about, since I was feeling bad they sent me to a cardiologist, he did an echocardiogram, and some other tests and my heart was fine. Got my Holter monitor and map, and everything was good but for some reason, I still have sinus tachycardia. Now I know I was having panic attacks. Fast forward he gave me some medicine for anxiety and an NSAID for chest pain. This was the worst my stomach started to ache daily (For the record I already had stomach pain randomly some weeks before), Then I went to a gastroenterologist and after endoscopy, yup, I got chronic gastritis. I switched cardiologists and the new one tested me again, she said that everything was fine but I did have some sinus tachycardia without reason, so now I'm on beta-blockers.

Gastritis has been hell for me, the treatment for H pylori destroyed me, and acid reflux had me going to the ER like twice a week thinking it was a heart attack because I didn't feel like a burning sensation, it was like pain-pain. Now I have this awful cardiophobia, if my chest hurts, I think I'm gonna die.

Two months later, I wasn't able to leave my bed because, with every effort I made, my heart started to beat fast. I got this awful back and neck pain so my then fiancee recommended a chiropractor, he went some time ago and they were able to help him, for some reason, I started to develop more pain after every adjustment, but with the last one I felt like something was different, I felt severely ill. After that day my chest started to hurt, and it's been 4 months. 

Now every day my chest hurts, my back hurts, my laterals hurt, and I have developed muscle spasms all over my body, on my arms, back, chest, legs, and even on my booty. Sometimes the pain feels muscular and it gets worse with the touch, sometimes burns and sometimes it's sharp. The issue is that I have severe cardiophobia and every time my chest hurts I think it's a heart attack, even though doctors say my heart is fine. I'm still taking beta-blockers for my tachycardia. Sometimes I have palpitations. I went to a psychologist, but tbh even though therapy is fine, I go one step forward and two backward. Recently I got married and  I'm walking daily, exercising in the gym, eating better, meditating, and doing some breathing techniques, but honestly, I feel like I'm not getting any better.

I went to different doctors to get checked out for my pains and no one has been able to help me, so many lab tests, x-rays, and even a CT and nothing, I'm waiting on the neurologist to see if it's some nerve issue, but I have to wait for another week because he's on vacations, but I can't take it anymore, I feel like I'm dying, I feel like I'm not going to get better, I get this intrusive thoughts about every day being my last and honestly I'm so tired, and it's no fair to my now husband. 

Has someone been through something similar? I need some hope.

Recently I’ve been prescribed Propranolol for panic attacks to take AS needed.

I feel really out of it, not completely stopping the panic attack from coming on.

Is this because I need to take it for a few weeks for my body to adapt? I’ve only taken it when needed, so like 3x in past 2 weeks. I’ve read a lot here (and have fam members) who say Propranolol works great for them so I don’t necessarily want to give up yet. 

My panic attacks are usually triggered mentally and the physical symptoms follow. I’m wondering if I need a benzo instead. I know those are addicting tho and hard to ween off so I really want propranolol to work!!

That’s a really long time. I hate the thought of just being asleep for that long, that’s eight hours I could be doing something, eight hours of my life every night that I’m just loosing. I’ve also been having some weird dreams that have been making me not want to sleep (I won’t really go into it because TW but they’ve been really vivid and they’ve terrified me). 

It’s been happening a little more often than usual now and I haven’t really had a good nights sleep. I take sleepy pills to help sleep almost every night but it’s only making me tired not calming me down. 

Any advice?"

18x3qwp,Anxiety,2024-01-02,Freaking out over muscle twitches! Help! :((,"Hi all!

I am a 31 yr old female who has been experiencing burning sensations in my pelvic region &amp; legs. I went to the ER and they ran a blood/urine test. Everything cleared except for very low Vitamin D (9). I was told it's due to my sedentary lifestyle (I work from home and usually do so laying down) and I need to start exercising. My PCP prescribed a weekly high dose of Vit D.

A week ago, I started walking an hour a day and noticed that my muscles started twitching after two days of walking. I am also experiencing numbness in my hands and legs. I immediately ran to google &amp; diagnosed myself with ***. I now have severe anxiety and my twitches haven't gone away, it's been a week! 

I am terrified that I have it and my twitching will lead to muscle weakness and progress, even though my recent exercise routine may be the cause. I made the mistake of reading stories of 30 year olds getting A** and their first symptom being twitching and taking years to be officially diagnosed. Now I can't get it out of my head! My mom's cousin passed from the disease.  I developed a severe health anxiety and can't even get a good night's sleep. I keep convincing myself that I have it since it has been only a week and I have lots of time to experience muscle weakness :((. Has anyone experienced this that can help?"

I cant stress enough how this has taken a toll into my life, how I feel like im 6ft below. I’d keep on asking myself why yet i dont have an answer and its driving me insane.

I see a lot of posts of people who experience anxiety but are still able to lead somewhat normal/healthy lives (social, have families, work in person, attend school, etc).  I would say my baseline anxiety on a scale of 1-10 has been about a 7 or 8 for the past two years and has mostly gotten worse despite my efforts and treatments. 

I’ve stopped driving competely, I’ve developed pretty severe agoraphobia to the point where I can’t even grocery shop without taking Ativan beforehand, I can’t eat at restaurants, I haven’t seen some of my friends and family members in months to years, I work remote and avoid meetings/calls as much as possible - even taking Ativan just to attend these, etc.

I’m pretty much completely isolated and my quality of life is extremely low; I’m just trying to make it through one day at a time. Hopefully 2024 is my year of healing and I’m able to look back at this post in a few months with a more positive outlook.

I drank heavily from age 22-38, so now I’m really worried about heart damage.

It all started with me basically passing out one night while getting ice cream out of the freezer. I told my doctor who referred me to a cardiologist. I have had an EKG, went back for the heart echo and they found “possible slight damage”. 

So now, I’m off to get a nuclear stress test next week and I am TERRIFIED. I am not in bad shape, why do they have to inject something in my body that will raise my heart rate? Why would they not just put me on the exercise machine.

So I am terrified of not only the test, but what they will find. If it’s anything, probably the alcohol has damaged my heart along the way. I am five years sober, for what it’s worth.

How was your experience with the nuclear stress test? Do they always pump something into your IV to increase your heart rate? 

Any help, notes, experiences would be helpful."
18x31am,Anxiety,2024-01-02,Panic Attacks on Planes - Flight Anxiety,"Hello! I just joined this subreddit and would love to hear from further anxiety sufferers. I am trying to prepare myself for a work trip in 2 months where I have to fly cross country (DC to San Francisco). Last time I flew, I had a panic attack mid-flight because of some turbulence we were having. Flying makes me really nervous in general, even though logically, I know it's the safest way of travel. However, what I'm mostly afraid of is getting a panic attack on the flight and being alone. I'm more afraid of how my body will react to turbulence or any other scary sound or situation on the flight than the flight itself. Once I'm in panic mode, my mind takes me to some scary scenarios like I'm having a medical emergency or heart attack and no one on the flight will be able to help me and I will die. My body physically also starts reacting. For example, my stomach gets upset, I start sweating then get cold and start shivering, etc. 

Movies/shows don't seem to distract me enough. I bring tea usually with me and it does help a bit. I would love to know what others do to keep themselves entertained, distracted and calm during flights. Do you have an anxiety kit that you take with you? 

I've been going to therapy for a while but just recently started with EMDR to try and heal this fear. I take Wellbutrin, Zoloft and Buspirone (specifically tackles anxiety) and in general, they help A LOT. It's specific situations, like flying, that everything goes out the window. I've been trying to make some diet changes as well to incorporate foods that help regulate the nervous system and combat anxiety in general. I think the one thing I'm hesitant to quit is coffee because I love the taste of it so much. I only have one small cup a day to avoid the jitters. I also started incorporating workouts, at least 2-3 times a week. 

Any other suggestions are welcome. I want to learn from others and see what I can try that will stick. "

18x2bfs,Anxiety,2024-01-02,"Anxiety is growing, I'm lost...","Hi everyone,  
  
I’m a 27 old male. I was diagnosed a generalized anxiety disorder about two years ago. Before that, for nearly four years I made so much trip to the ER and took so many medical exams that I can’t count. All the tests were always good, I’m healthy and in my family there is no people with heart disease just some cancers but due to alcoholism or tabacco with I don’t do. For people I was just stressed and I cared too much of what my body was telling me. Of course, it was panic attack, and I don’t know triggered them. In 2022, I was stressed all time, and was sure my body will let me down. To be honest, I was following everyday what happened in Ukraine and was pretty convince we will be in a WW3 pretty soon or a nuclear war. So, on the advice of a friend, I started a therapy. For a year I saw a psychologist and I was better. From august 2022 to November 2023 that was a moment, probably the best. I made friends, going out a lot, meet my girlfriend, I was no more afraid. The fear of dying and the negatives thoughts was gone. It last until the end of 2023 which was a turning point for me. Days prior the event my heart was racing a lot more than usual when I was going to work. Around 130 which high for me. I started to feel stressed again, but I had no reason to be. My job is not stressful, I have enough money to eat every day, I don’t worry about paying invoices or anything else. My biggest problem was “when will have time to play video game more because I just got a PS5”. So really an easy life for dude in the West. On November 01, I was going to work and after entering the metro, I start feeling unwell. I’m feeling my heart race going faster and faster. I decide to go out of the metro and I’m outside my heart race peak at 189, I’m dizzy, I’m feeling weak, my legs are about to let me go and I’m saying to myself “that it, it’s how I’m gonna die”. I was on the phone with my best friend the all-time but I was sure it was the end for me. My heart would explode and goodbye. By luck I was near an ER. I go there, they do some test (ECG etc) and everything was normal. My heart race was high but not alarming (120 ish). They found nothing. As always. Since this day, I’m so afraid of everything. I don’t go out anymore. At first, I tried a few time to go out during November but I stressed all the time, I was always near my house and one time I even do a panic attack in front of it. So now I’m lost, I’m scared and I feel more alone than ever. I tried to make things better but it only getting worse. I see my psychologist weekly, my girlfriend (we live together) is highly supportive. But I’m just scared. I’m scared of going out, I’m scared of losing my job, scared of losing my girlfriend, scared of dying. I’m scared of my heart rate. That It will suddenly go fast and I will died. Every single thing is a battle. Even taking a shower is hard. I feel my heart pounding and sometimes I just go up to 140 in the shower (or even sometimes just going in the bathroom can trigger it). My doctor prescribes me some Zoloft but I can’t take it. I’m scared of the side effects, that I will mess up my heart and I will drop dead. I meditate everyday but some time I feel more stressed after then before. I don’t drink, I don’t eat fast food. I read philosophy (Stoicism) but it’s not enough. The “what if”, even in a not rational moment, always win.  
I don’t know what to do anymore. It looks like anxiety is taking everything on its way and I’m just a passenger too afraid to do anything.   
I willing to take any advice or help you can give. I’m starting to lose this war, but I don’t wanna. I’m out of ammo. Is anyone as ever experienced something similar?

18x24je,Anxiety,2024-01-02,USA Work Accommodations for Therapy?,"I have GAD and am starting a new job, which is anxiety inducing as well. I have a therapist that I do telehealth appointments with, but she only works during the times I’m at work. Currently I schedule appointments on the days that I work from home, but my new job is full time in the office and I have a set schedule.
I’m wondering if I need or can get a workplace accomodation for frequent telehealth medical appointments and be provided with a private space and ability to flex my schedule to take a longer lunch break and work later that day. 

Has anyone been through that? How did it work? Last thing I need is no access to therapy while I’m going through a stressful life event"
18x1wfn,Anxiety,2024-01-02,Panic disorder bc of stuck emotions,"I’ve been on reddit for multiple years now, reading a lot of posts in this community as well. But, this is my first post on this platform. (I’ve created a second account to post anonymously because I have a hard time sharing my experiences)

Last month, I had my 4th year ‘anniversary’ of having a panic disorder. Although I have other diagnoses as well which I have been successfully treated for, my panic disorder has troubled me the most by far. 

In short a little back story about me: frequent panic attacks ranging from 1 every few days to more often upwards of 5 per day, sometimes disabling me from being able to perform daily activities. Handling a full time job (40 hrs a week) in a target driven business.

Following years of treatment, the conclusion is that the origin of my panic disorder lays in the lack of being able to express my emotions. For example: I feel rage inside my body but I am afraid to express the rage because earlier on in life, I was taught to hold back expressing my emotions. My body automatically turns that oppressed rage into a panic attack as a coping mechanism. All so I do not have to experience my emotions. 

I actually have 3 questions which I’d love to ask this community. 

1. Do/did any of you have panic attacks / disorder because of a similar cause? If so, how do you deal with it?

2. Have any of you had a panic disorder for multiple years and found a way to cope with it in life? Note: coping for me means living a happy life.

3. My panic attacks are mainly focused on the fear of losing control. Have any of you guys found a way to cope with the constant anxiety about potentially losing control?

If any of you are able to answer either one of these questions (or all) I’d be very grateful. Thank you for reading my story. For me, it’s a very big thing to go public with this and share my (very summarized) story."
18x1sdt,Anxiety,2024-01-02,"I don’t know if this is from anxiety and/or medication. While trying to fall asleep, does anyone else have something similar to hypnic jerks, but without the jerk?","I take 7.5mg of buspar 3x each day. A hypnic jerk makes the most sense when I look it up. The best way I can describe it is during the transition from awake to asleep, I feel conscious longer, like closer to the state of being asleep. So I’m conscious, thinking, and without having any feeling of being asleep in the slightest, I’m popping my eyes open (kind of startled but with no jerk). Often then I just feel kind of off, kind of groggy (not the best word to describe it) and a general anxious/scared feeling. Sometimes I feel like I’m starting to dream while I’m still somewhat conscious and suddenly I’m awake again. 

I’ve been on buspar for 3 years and never had an issue until about 6 months ago (no change in dosage). It only happens when I’m already in a state of anxiety. I still feel like buspar plays a part in this because I have tried adjusting the time of my last dosage and it’s more likely to happen if I take buspar closer to bedtime. Even if it’s not the buspar and only anxiety, I’ve had anxiety for 20 years and never had this issue. 

Sometimes it’s kinda scary and I don’t like the “groggy” and anxious feeling I have afterwards. I guess my biggest concern with this is I don’t like the feeling after but I also really don’t like the dreamlike state before falling asleep."
191aj6u,Anxiety,2024-01-08,Am I Enough?,"The Radiant Star

Once upon a time, in a land filled with doubts and insecurities, there lived a radiant star named Luna. But Luna often questioned herself, wondering, ""Am I enough?""

One day, as Luna gazed upon the world, she realized her true brilliance. She shimmered like the sun, casting her warm light upon the earth. In that moment, she knew the answer: ""Yes, I am enough!""

Luna understood that she didn't have to please everyone. Like the sun, she couldn't brighten every corner at once. But her light was powerful, capable of touching hearts and illuminating paths. Embracing this truth, she released the burden of trying to please everyone.

Sometimes, Luna's mind played tricks on her, filling her thoughts with self-doubt. But she discovered that these thoughts were not her reality. With a courageous spirit, she learned to let them go, setting herself free from their grasp.

Luna realized that comparing herself to others only dimmed her light. She was unique, special, and rare. Each person she encountered had their own journey, their own dreams. So instead of comparing, Luna celebrated her individuality and embraced the differences that made her shine.

In the company of others, Luna remained true to herself. She understood that no one could truly know the depths of her thoughts and emotions. So she chose to be authentic, allowing her genuine self to radiate like a guiding star. And in doing so, she discovered happiness and freedom, living her life with zeal.

Luna recognized that her thoughts were within her control. She could release the ones that caused distress and hold onto those that brought peace. With the power of her mind, she became the master of her own thoughts, bidding farewell to anxiety.

With every realization, Luna's confidence grew. She knew, without a doubt, that she was more than enough. She not only survived, but thrived and soared to unimaginable heights. Her light became a beacon of hope for others, inspiring them to believe in their own worth.

""Yes,"" Luna declared, her voice resonating across the universe. ""I am enough and more!"" Her spirit ignited with passion, fueling her determination. She embraced her true self, a radiant star bursting with sunshine, joy, and peace. And as she released her worries, her heart danced with a melody of contentment.

So, my friend, remember Luna's tale. You too are enough, worthy, strong, and tough. No challenge is insurmountable, no dream too far. Believe in yourself, let your light shine, and make your heart sing. For within you lies a brilliance that can illuminate the world."

A bit of background I am diagnosed bipolar disorder and adhd and medicated.

So 2023 has been a tough year and some situations happened quite close together:

- at the start of the year I cut my best friend of 10 years out of my life because I finally realised I was not being treated right
- I got a new manager at work who was extremely toxic 
- my dad went to a psych hospital for a manic episode, I took time off work for stress
- dad got better but my work situation didn’t I did 8 months of therapy during the stressful time in work I decided to work my notice after coming back from a second time of stress leave as I realised It wasn’t worth it.
- noticed I was isolating more I am introverted but I was avoiding social gatherings even bursting into tears before leaving for a party and deciding to stay home.
- got a procedure to remove pre cancerous cells under general anaesthetic which completely messed me up for a week after.
- a week after that my dad went for knee surgery 
- my dad came home and 3 days before Christmas he got rushed to hospital as a clot went to his lungs and spent 5 days in icu

My dad is still in hospital but on an acute ward now and he is on the mend thankfully and I visit him everyday.

I noticed during the actual crisis period I could handle it well but now I feel drained. On NYE I cancelled plans last minute I was suppose to go to a small social gathering with my boyfriend I got overwhelmed and cried before leaving and we stayed at home. I was never a huge fan of social gatherings but I could grin and bear them. 

I feel I am starting to avoid situations a lot more but I wouldn’t say I’m depressed. Weirdly my sleep is ok for the moment but my jaw hurts from clenching my teeth so much and I seem to squirm and block out when family members go into detail of the night my dad got taken in the ambulance ( I was not at home when it happened) 

 I am talking to my psychiatrist tomorrow about this but I am looking for some advice if people experienced similar from being stressed for a long time.

Thanks in advance :)"

Finally got a doctor and after seeing my ear visits where egk, bloodwork, and X-rays were good, he said it’s anxiety and we need to get rid of that to see what’s actually going on.  He prescribed me 20mg lexapro, and to take 10 for first two weeks.. I tried to take it but the side effects were so bad first two days so I switched to taking half of the half instead( so 5mg) I haven’t had a panic attack since being on it but I still have all these pains and anxious thoughts.  Head aches everyday, just something not feeling right.  Random chest pains, arm, leg and back pains, shoulder pains.  But here recently have been noticing blood pulling in hands, they get all red, hot and bulging veins even up arm.  Now hands are almost always red and it I touch my palm/ fingers they go white for a second then back red, unless I raise them above heart. You can also see white spots on hands.  I took a shower and fingers pruned up beyond fast and became colorless. I don’t know what this is could it all be anxiety?  My symptoms worsening? A vascular issue, or side effects of lexapro? Loosing my mind, really.. I have appointment with this doctor on the 11th and idk if I should call about these or is it no big deal and to wait?"
18x1f6q,Anxiety,2024-01-02,Asking my boss for time off,"Hello everyone, 

I am about 2 months into a job. This job is leasing and it’s a fairly easy job.  
(I’ve worked in student leasing before and traditional leasing is farrrr easier.) 

The only employees are me and my boss. (The property manager) because most of the renters are renewals and have been for the last 10+ years with maybe 100 residents total property-wide. 

I’ve done a good job getting acclimated to this job and I feel like I’ve picked up everything already with minimal mistakes. 

(Since I’m new, I don’t have any PTO or holiday pay for 6 months. So to preface, she isn’t paying me for any time I take off or any time that the office is closed for holidays)

November-January are really busy months for me and my partner. We’ve gone back and forth to his hometown for thanksgiving and Christmas, and we have a vacation coming up on the 10th of this month for a week. 

We were offered through my partner’s work to get PAID to go on another vacation the 27th-1st (two of those days are weekend days that I don’t work anyways). 
It’s a trip to my dream vacation destination and I’ve wanted to go here since I was young. 

So the reason I writing this, is because my boss is someone who “doesn’t take time off even when you’re sick” and has 200+ hours of PTO that she chooses to not use every year (even if it doesn’t roll over) 

So I’m worried about how to tell her that I have this vacation coming up a week (right after another vacation).

(This is irrelevant to my exact situation (kind of) but we are moving from our current place (college town)  in May to a major city and I’m quitting the job to go back to school anyways so I will be leaving regardless in the next 4 months minimum)  

And I know I shouldn’t focus on what people think about me but I’m just a really anxious person and I am worried about her saying I cannot have the time off and having to quit.

I appreciate any input. And I’m able to answer any questions.
 Thanks!"

18x0p3e,Anxiety,2024-01-02,Cardiophobia/health anxiety is consuming my life,"TW: breif mention of marijuana useage

TLDR: Cardiophobia fucking sucks. I feel heart attack symptoms constantly and feel like im going to die every day. 

Back in September, I started having really bad heart palpitations. My heart would skip beats pretty badly. Went to the ER twice for it, they checked me out and said I was fine, gave me some meds, did a 3 day holter monitor, and got sent to a cardiologist who also said I was fine but sent me to get a Stress Echo which also came back fine. 

Since then, my Dad, whom has been extremely heathy for the past 20 years, went in to get a calcium screen which came back extremely high. He ended up having a bad stress echo and had open heart surgery with 5 bypasses. 

After he had his surgery, I cannot stop thinking that it may be genetic. And with my previous palps (which have gotten much better since I switched my asthma meds) its even worse. I have had approx 10-15 EKGs since then, chest xrays, and been put on a non-narcotic anxiety medication. Nothing seems to ease the stress. I even stopped vaping and smoking weed. Which may have made my anxiety even worse.

Ill get symptoms ranging from tightness in my left pec to tightness/tingling/mild pain in my left arm, back pain in all different places (which ive had since high school), lightheadedness, and even pain in the jaw. Its driving me to fucking insanity. 

Recently schedule myself for a calcium screen that I most likely don't even need. Every single day Ill get this feeling that im about to die. Life is becoming short of impossible to enjoy. Couldnt even enjoy Christmas this year thanks to all this.

In my spare time, I play video games, watch anime/TV and films and browse social media.

I am fairly new to my career, but enjoy what I do nonetheless and love learning as I go along. That being said, I feel like a lot of what I do in my spare time holds me back somehow from being the professional that I aspire to be in many ways. By that, I mean in a more senior role hopefully one day!

I see a lot of other people who work in the same industry as me, who either don't have social media as far as I know, or if they do they just have a LinkedIn or a Twitter account that is basically LinkedIn for them (i.e they retweet what their company posts out, etc.). Meanwhile, my Twitter mainly consists of retweets of video game art and the occasional shitpost.

Is it wrong to think that my hobbies (video games, anime, films, etc.) are a poor reflection on myself as a working professional? I feel like a lot of other people who are either on the same level as me career-wise, or miles ahead of me have more 'mature' hobbies - and that feels like a strange thing to type, but it also feels like the truth at the same time.

I honestly don't know what constitutes a 'mature' hobby when I say this - but I think it stems from guilt of not being productive 24/7 (something I have talked about here previously) and perhaps taking too much of social media at face value and not seeing the bigger picture (again, something I have posted about recently) but I want to know what your advice would be; do you ever feel this guilt or like there's something in your way that stops you from unlocking your true potential? Or like, you feel like you can't be your authentic self while also holding down a stable job?

If you're someone who likes to play video games, usually as a main hobby, do you feel like it reflects on what you do for a living, or just on you as a person? Ideally, I want to be able to enjoy the hobbies that I do, but not feel this sense of guilt everytime I do because I am a 'professional' and feel like there is a level of standard I have to achieve each day if I want to be succesful as well in terms of my career, like something is telling me in the back of my mind ""You either want to be a gaming nerd, or a working professional, you can't be both. Choose one."""

1918in3,Anxiety,2024-01-08,How do I stop myself from itching when I get anxiety?," It's often for me to itch my neck (which can lead across all parts of my chest, sometimes my arms) when I feel anxious over the slightest things. This feeling hits me only in certain moments that can last up to around 10 minutes. This has been going on for at least a few years and I'm not sure how to treat it. My friends and family have told me that my stress levels are incredibly high (especially for my age) and that I overthink and worry about little things. I've contemplated going to see a doctor of some sort for it, but I don't know if it's something that I should take into a professional's hands if I can find a way to treat it myself.

Since then I have had nothing but extreme anxiety, feeling “unreal” like I’m in a dream and not really here. I have constant anxiety attacks, I can’t take pills, eat certain things, etc. I often have this achy pain in my top left stomach, kinda under my left breast. 

I went to the doctors in November and they prescribed me 25mg of Zoloft, but I haven’t started in yet. I’m overwhelmed and I wasn’t even sure where to turn to. I have a therapist, but I just feel off every night. I’m worried of going back to the hospital just to be told it’s anxiety.

18wz9pe,Anxiety,2024-01-02,IV Sedation,"Hello all,

I’ve posted on here quite a few times and here I am again 😰 on Thursday at 11am I will be undergoing iv sedation for a molar extraction/bone graft and 5 fillings on my right side. To say I am nervous is an understatement. I have put off dental treatment for years and ended up with an abscess, took 3 weeks of antibiotics to put off treatment and drilled out my own filling with the hopes I could just let “my tooth drain” and put it off indefinitely, which is as stupid and done in a moment of intense panic and regretted.

I am posting here for support and encouragement, and of course for any real life great examples of how your procedures went.

My fears:
- Being Sedated - How will it feel? I don’t do any drugs or drink (I used to a lot when I was younger but weed ended up giving me panic attacks and intense anxiety. Drinking also started to give anxiety and I just don’t like being out of control) and I don’t even take ibprofuen unless it’s excruciating. I hate not feeling in control of my own body so this is super scary to me. My legit hope is that I’ll be sitting there (probably crying lol) and then wake up fully oriented and it’s all done. The in between bits where I may feel dizzy or disoriented or drunk or high, it’s freaking me out.

- Dying - I should say this is a huge anxiety for me. I’ve spent weeks agonizing over possibly dying from this and leaving behind my husband and teenage daughter over something I choose to do vs something mandatory. I’m having the IV sedation because of my dental phobia, so I know this is the best and safest way to have my dental work done (for my health) but it feels so so scary and if I died from it then my mind feels like I am choosing it.
Ways I’m worried about dying specifically:
1. allergic reaction - I’ve never had midazolam as far as I know and I’ve not ever had any other benzos
2. stop breathing and they can’t get it back
3. cardiac arrest
3. complications from local anesthesia (brachycardia or overdose)

- Paradoxical reactions - I am absolutely terrified the midazolam could make me crazy, combative, and hallucinate. I know it happens in like less than 1% of people and they’re usually old or young (and I’m in the middle at 36, almost 37) but my brain has fixated on this because it would be terrifying. I did find some comfort here in reading studies that father reversal drug for midazolam (flunazemil?) is also about to reverse paradoxical reactions, but I’m just worried if it happened and all and I remembered it that I could suffer mental complications long term from the terror.

Those are the things I’m most scared of, and they’re all in regards to control. I am trying to remind myself that anxiety doesn’t change outcomes, and trust my dentist and his team to fully take care of me and safely provide me the dental treatment I so desperately need, but it’s been a struggle.

Any and all encouragement is absolutely appreciated. I know that there are other dental phobics just like me, who have had these same worries and fears to the point of letting it rule their minds and lives also, but it’s so hard for me to believe any one else has ever been this scared.

This forum has helped me thus far, I think I’ve read every single iv sedation experience 100 times over. I am hopeful that I’ll be reporting back on Thursday will a great result and excited to fully handle my dental journey this year. Pray for me!"

It really affects me in my daily life as well as I‘d just remind myself „can‘t do that, too embarrassing in front of person x/y“ and then not do what I wanted to do. It‘s been like this for maybe a year now, but recently it‘s been getting worse and worse. I‘m also in therapy but couldn‘t bring myself to tell my therapist yet because I‘m scared that she‘ll find it weird and just straight up send me to a mental hospital or sum lol. I also don‘t really know what diagnosis I have, since my therapist doesn‘t wanna tell me because it could make the effects of those illnesses worse, but I for sure know I‘m diagnosed with depression as I got antidepressants. She also once said that I seem to have lots of fears and that I seem to be anxious often what‘s why I would guess, (now don‘t come for me dude) that I have anxiety too. The antidepressants I take actually help you calm down too and they do, but only like the random heart racing, adrenaline rushes and randomly not being able to breath for like 3 seconds and that stuff. But not a single bit made my paranoia or whatever it is better. Should I tell my therapist? And if yea, how do you think is the best way to approach her with it?

18wxf52,Anxiety,2024-01-02,Intense physical symptoms for over a year and struggling to cope,"TL:DR been experiencing intense anxiety for over a year and can’t stop thinking that the physical symptoms are symptoms of some deadly disease 

Hi I’m M 21 and living in the UK. I have intense physical symptoms of anxiety daily and have done for about a year and a half. Despite seeking medical advice multiple times I can’t convince myself that I’m not seriously Ill.

Some backstory. During the summer of 2022 I was in a supermarket and noticed my heart began to race. I started breathing rapidly, felt like I was going to pass out but also explode at the same time, I felt like I was going to be sick and felt like I was having a heart attack. I genuinely thought I was going to die. My mother raced me to the hospital where they saw me and monitored me. They took bloods, did multiple ECG’s and found nothing. They actually said despite my white blood cell count being a little lower than usual, I was in really good health. After this I cut everything bad out of my life, energy drinks, smoking, weed, alcohol EVERYTHING . I do still vape but with a negligible amount of nicotine.

For a month after this I CONSTANTLY felt nauseous, dizzy, shaky, fearful etc so I went back to the doctor stressing that I continued to have really bad symptoms and a rapid heart. After further investigation they then diagnosed me with SVT (super ventricular tachycardia- basically means your heart isn’t pumping blood enough) so this terrified me, turned out to be a false diagnosis (after they tried to put me on beta blockers, I couldn’t believe how bad they were, they didn’t even examine me before attempting to medicate)

Anyway, 1 false diagnosis down I was still having symptoms. I ended up being called to the doctor when a really nice Doc told me he thought I was experiencing a form of Generalised Anxiety Disorder and Health Anxiety Disorder. When he explained more it made total sense. I had been having intense panic attacks everyday fuelled by my fear of thinking it was something life threatening. Plus the false diagnosis id previously received didn’t help to calm my mind. 

But to this day a year later, while it’s better than it was, I still have intense moments of panic even when I’m not stressed about anything. I still have moments of immense dizziness, nausea and panic. Feeling like I’m going to pass out but also run a mile. It’s crazy. I’m writing this now because I just had one of these moments for no reason. I keep thinking I’m deathly ill or something!!

I don’t know what to do, does anyone else have a similar experience? Any advice? Anything at all that might help me out."

I am much better now on local roads, and merging off / on 95, 295 etc. I lived in noVA aka the DMV area for years and am now relocated in Williamsburg. (Much quieter and less cars) 😊 but yeah still never getting on 66. Too many drivers and ppl are nuts.

Lately I have been freaking out because I notice that when I eat my hr is 97-100 sitting. But since I work it gets up to the 130’s if I get up and walk. This is really causing eating anxiety while at work. Has anyone experienced something similar?
18wwwuo,Anxiety,2024-01-02,Disclaimer: Long Post &lt;3,"⚠️PSA:⚠️
There’s no such thing as being behind in life or being behind in society…the only things along those lines that are real are social constructs, societal bias and comformity, generational trauma, closed-mindedness, desperation for validation from other people, the illusion of superiority in the form of unnecessary, unwanted, and unasked for judgement, the fear the government specifically designs to control the people to get more money and power, peer pressure, and unhealthy perfectionism. Don’t be a sheep, allow yourself to be a unique, beautifully imperfect human…life has no set schedule or manual, so stop comparing yourself to others. Don’t be afraid to be different or go against the societal/social norm. Learn to be okay with being controversial, and unlearn society’s unrealistic standards. You’re uniquely you. It’s not your job to keep everyone else happy. However it is your job to keep your peace and to do what’s best for your life, your plans, and your mental health…even if it upsets people. You’re worth it. Stop caring about what other people think of you and other people’s opinions…they’re just that, opinions. It’s time to stop fearing other people, they’re only human, just like you, with their own flaws and challenges and personal hells to go through. If something doesn’t affect you, just shut up about it and don’t butt into other people’s business. It’s not your life, it’s theirs, and you’re not them. And to incorrectly assume you know exactly what someone might be going through or what it’ll take to cut them into one of society’s boring, sheep, conformist cookies, is just so wrong and sad and pathetic on so many levels. Again, you’re not them, you’re not in their mind, you’re not in their situation, so shut up about things you know nothing about, doesn’t matter if they’re friends or family. It’ll just make things worse if you judge and assume. And things you say literally have the ability to stick with people and rewire their brains and change their brain chemistry, so don’t be the reason people start thinking that they’re not enough or even the reason they start considering unaliving themself. Be the opposite. Perfection doesn’t and will never exist, no matter what society says. Fuck society and their unrealistic, engineered standards. Don’t add to society’s toxicity, half of them don’t deserve the time of day. Your imperfections are beautiful. Additonally, always try to spread love, positivity, understanding, unconditional support, and empathy wherever and whenever you can, you never know what someone else might be going through and you could even be the person to restore their faith in humanity 💖

I’m proud of you, and you should be proud of yourself too, even for the baby steps. Some progress is better than no progress at all, ignore the haters and don’t let them put you back to square one…and don’t let them make you even think that you’re back at square one when they’re not you and don’t have your mind or your experiences, it’s not their life, and they have no right to judge your progress, especially when I know half of your progress most people are too blind to see…I see your progress, and you’re doing absolutely amazing 😊

And no, this isn’t a copypasta I randomly found on the internet, these are simply my unfiltered thoughts that have been building up for quite awhile now and wanted to share 🩵"

If through some magic my palpitations would disappear, my stomach didn’t ache, my head didn’t throb, my lungs didn’t tighten and my mind didn’t race with negative thoughts all the damn time. Everyone around me acts as if i am choosing to be this way. How I wish I could get them to spend some time in my body and see how this fucking feels. I am so upset right now, not just at the actions of my “friends” but also because I feel so alone in my suffering. They don’t have the least bit of an idea how it feels to have crippling anxiety.

18wwnn0,Anxiety,2024-01-02,Stress and anxiety manifesting physically,"I’m under a lot of stress recently. Burnt out from work and eventually resigned. Right now I venturing into a new career (which if I fail to make work would be the end of me—literally) and it really makes me even more anxious. 

Since then I’ve been 💩 at least 4-5 times a day, even though I haven’t been eating as much as I used to. In fact, I lost appetite a couple of days ago. I can’t get a good 7-8 hours sleep, been only sleeping 4 hours at most. My heart’s always racing, hands are trembling—and just yesterday, I have been feeling nauseous which led to vomitting. Because I haven’t been eating much, I only puked water. 

I took some medications for the nausea but the sleeplessness, irritability, trembling hands, loose bowel, and heart pounding still persist. 

I want to get checked by a healthcare professional but I’m not sure which one since I’m pretty aware that I have both physical and mental concerns right now. I believe the physical symptoms I’m having are a result of stress and anxiety and it’s making it hard for me to concentrate and do the things I need to do. I live in a place where healthcare isn’t cheap so seeing a doctor for each is not possible at the moment considering I have just resigned from my job as well. 

PS. I am not clinically diagnosed with anxiety. But I do think the last few weeks have made me really anxious and stressed out."

18wwjj3,Anxiety,2024-01-02,Anxious about my actions and having anxiety thinking I burned bridges. Please help.,"Hi everyone - 

Writing this because I am struggling so hard today that I literally didn’t know who else to turn to. Though, this is clearly making me think I need to find a therapist STAT (long overdue but that’s a different story). 

So here’s the situation. 

I play a lot of volleyball. 5-6 days a week. I’m very involved and know a lot of people in the community. I sign up for a lot of tournaments and a lot of open gyms / practices. Well over the Christmas holiday I started to get very depressed (something happened with a volleyball friend that turned out they weren’t really a friends and it really triggered me) and I started having really bad anxiety and I was coping with it by sleeping a lot. I kept saying fuck that friend I’m just quitting playing and became super dramatic about it but then became very depressed. 

During that time I missed two volleyball tournaments.  I never told the person organizing it that I wasn’t coming. I ghosted. I admit it.  Because of the ghosting I then stopped responding to everyone. I stopped answering texts and Facebook messages and I ended up missing a third tournament because I ghosted those people again. 

As I’m coming out of my depressive funk, I’m now realizing I may have burnt bridges. I may have lost friends. I may have ruined my name in the volleyball community. 

But I don’t want to quit. It’s the only thing that has brought me a sense of community, it’s my reason for getting out of the house, it’s my favorite thing to do and I’m good at it and I feel good about myself when I do it. And now I’m worried I have nothing left and I’ve burnt it all to the ground. I don’t know what to do. I talked to my sister and she said to respond to the messages and just tell people you were sick and she seemed to think people would be forgiving. I’m so terrified to open my messages and to have to read those messages but I also want my life back. These depressive episodes ruin everything for me. I self sabotage during them all the time. I don’t want to give up my favorite hobby but I’m not sure I can bring myself to read the messages and respond. 

Any advice? Any advice on how to respond if I do read them? Should I just take my entire Facebook down? 

Thank you in advance."
18wwih0,Anxiety,2024-01-02,I physically can't come clean about a big lie,"I've lived with anxiety for my whole life and I take meds.

3 years ago I told my mom a HUGE lie, that I had graduated from college( and later on that I got a good job. In fact I dropped out and I've been living as a NEET ever since, using some money I got from an inheritance. Not much but I eat and live like shit. 

My mom came to visit at Christmas and will be leaving soon. I need to tell her the truth before that but I can't. If I even think about it I start to feel physically ill and can't breathe.

We aren't rich and I have no siblings or dad so me wasting my life is a huge deal to her. I told lies on top of lies on top of lies to sustain that first lie, coming clean about it is just too much. I've thought about checking myself into a mental hospital but I read so many horror stories about them online that I'm too scared to do it.

Does anyone have any tips about coming clean about a huge lie like that?"
18wwi3k,Anxiety,2024-01-02,Unending focus on body symptoms,"Hi all,

Most of my anxiety has to do with negative feelings in my body. Upset stomach, bloated feeling, increased heart rate. Essentially everything that happens when you go to the gym or are anxious.

It seems that some feeling can trigger anxiety and create more feelings. 
Usually I can do my things when the feelings are not too overwhelming. I'm not having any triggering thoughts, other then that I don't want/like the feeling.

Today was one day that I struggled to get trough, because I couldn't stop focussing on the anxiety symptoms I was feeling. And because of that I obviously increased it.

I know CBT and ACT, and they help to some degree.

Does anyone have relatable experiences and or tips?
Even the obvious ones are welcome."

But the person who does this is inhuman, it’s like a caricature of a perfect person. I do not want to be perfect, I just want to be normal. Everyone around me engages in sensual pleasures but my anxiety wants me to force myself to not even touch these things. Let alone the palpitations and tightness in my stomach and other physical symptoms which arise every time, the guilt alone is unsurvivable. I hate this disease, it has ruined every waking moment of my life. Sometimes I wish I had cancer instead of spending each second fearing it. I hate living like this, I want to end myself and my anxiety with me."

18wvp73,Anxiety,2024-01-02,Random Nauseating Panic Attacks,"Hi all,

Since graduating college and recently starting a new job at an investment bank, working long, intense, hours, I’ve noticed a major uptick in my anxiety. I’ve been diagnosed previously with GAD, Bipolar, and ADHD. I’ve been on Seroquel for Bipolar and it works great. However, I’ve noticed throughout the day I get these random panic attacks that I never experienced until I started working. My hands start to sweat, my heart races, my vision gets sort of disoriented, and I get an intense feeling of nausea. I notice it especially in meetings or when talking to a superior one-on-one. Or it can be completely random. I had one bad episode of dry heaving in the bathroom and seeing hallucination patterns that I had to leave work, later ended up calling paramedics because I was convinced I was going to have a heart attack (I didn’t, it showed me how it is all in my head). My psychiatrist now has me on klonopin as needed, usually ends up being 0.5-2mg daily, but she says this cannot go on forever as Klonopin’s side effects are heavy. I live a healthy lifestyle outside of work (MMA 6x a week [never feel anxious at the gym luckily], eat very healthy, get 7 hours of sleep at least, quit caffeine). I don’t know what to do at this point. I know it is all mental, but I can’t keep popping klonopin like candy, especially when it doesn’t even work 100%. Any advice? Any meds I should try?

Please and thank you."

My New Year’s resolution was to try and toughen up with the anxiety and just get on with it. Mind over matter kind of thing. Obviously if it was as easy as this most of us wouldn’t be facing these issues. I’m trying to be tougher but it’s so hard to do that when I’ve got a pounding head, shivery, upset tummy, dizzy etc

I just don’t see how I can get over this anxiety when the physical symptoms are so strong even when I don’t know what I’m worrying about. Anyone relate and/or have tips to get over this? I can’t have this be my life for yet another year"
18wuw88,Anxiety,2024-01-02,Anxiety or Health Issue,"Hi Forum,  


I wanted to post about my current situation and see if anyone in this community had any thoughts regarding my recent health spell.   


I have been dealing with shortness of breath / racing heart which made it difficult to fall asleep for about a year now. I had an EKG done in February with everything coming back positive. This past summer, I had an episode where I thought I was having an allergic reaction (throat and stomach swelling, heart pounding, and very close to fainting), however the EMT said my oxygen levels were near 100%. I had 2 other episodes over the next 2 days and was admitted into the ER for 3 days straight. An EKG and blood work was done and nothing came back concerning. I saw my doctor in September and he did my vitals/ blood work which also came back fine. I have not had an episode since but am still living in discomfort since this summer from the symptoms below:  


\-Shortness of Breath (Especially when exercising or having long conversations)  
\-(Occasionally) Impending Feeling of Doom when lying down and trying to sleep   
\-Discomfort in left sternum (Vagnus Nerve?)  
\-Blood Pressure is usually in the high 120s - high 130s  
\-Racing Heart  
\-Dry Cough  
\-Stuffy nose and mucus buildup (potential metallic or blood taste)  
\-(Occasionally) Swollen throat when eating - occurs most when out to dinner or drinking alcohol (Can't have more than 1 drink)  
\-Cold Feet / Pins and needles/ ankle rash (could be unrelated)  
\-(Occasionally) Bloating of the stomach  
\-(Occasionally) Lightheaded and feeling faint - worst when moving around or drinking caffeine   
\-(Occasionally) Belching / Flatulence (could be diet lol)  
Here is what myself and my doctor looked at (although he said he isn't sure and is not concerned after looking at me):  
\-Allergic Reaction (no prior allergies and one episode happened after doing being able to put food down for a day)  
\-Heart Issue (Have always felt something in the area but Doctors did not see anything that presented itself and no family history)  
\-Long Covid or Sinus Infection (I do have bad seasonal allergies but 6 months is very long)  
\-GERD / Gut Issue (my family has an extensive history and my throat does feel a bit less swollen after taking Omeprazole, but other symptoms seem strange)  
\-Anxiety / Panic Attack (Mom and Dad are anxious people / I do overthink)  
\-Anything else I did not mention  
I am a 22 year old former college athlete who is in very good shape (eat healthy, little alcohol, don't smoke / vape / use weed) and want to address these issues. It has drastically altered how I sleep and feel throughout the day, which is very concerning. I would greatly appreciate any thoughts / suggestions and please let me know if any other information could be helpful."
18wuvrd,Anxiety,2024-01-02,Problem with sounds that muffle or limit awareness of my surrounding?,"I don't have problem with the sound or noise per se so it's probably not phonophobia. It's just that I can't keep those sounds running for long— like tapwater while I'm in the bathroom, fan on full speed or loud music (I mostly use only one side of my earphone) because I don't like being not able to sense or hear what's happening in the surrounding beyond. Like what if someone's approaching my door, or calling, or if something's not right in the neighborhood. It doesn't affect me terribly but there's surely some discomfort.

Does that sound like hypervigilance? Does anyone else feel that way?"

when i wake up at the 5 hour mark, i cannot go back to sleep unless i wait 2 hours OR eat a banana.

is this anxiety?

i thought it was a low blood sugar problem but last night i set my alarm to wake me up at the 4.5hr mark and then i drank a bottle of coconut water. i was actually not even able to fall back asleep after that until like 7am, unfuckingbelievable.

this is telling me it may not be sugar related but i still think it might be high cortisol… or anxiety?

18wuf8l,Anxiety,2024-01-02,How to get off autopilot and feel real again?,"Hey there, I’m gonna get straight to the point, basically I’ve been disassociated the whole of last year, went through a really bad rut, I’m doing good now and can never go back, but it really still frustrates me that I am still disassociated. It’s not as bad as last year but I still struggle to feel fully in the moment and enjoy everything like I used to. Sometimes I partially latch on with smells and sensations, but I genuinely have not felt present and clear for a whole year now. I previously had been through a terrible anxiety phase too, I could not order speak to store clerks or anyone without breaking down, so I now believe this disassociation is a coping mechanism for anxiety that possibly got worse without me noticing.

Has anyone had any similar experiences and knows anything? It’s pretty sad that all my experiences last year are blurry, but I’m hoping to get back to normal very soon, just don’t know where to start. Thanks everyone."

18wsw3m,Anxiety,2024-01-02,Need some support,"I’ve made some major progress in my anxiety over the last couple months, with the help of groups like this, a therapist, and some lifestyle changes. There’s one last hurdle I can’t seem to jump, and that’s being alone. Not like the doomed feeling of being alone forever (I’m married, I have children, I live close to family), but I’m a stay at home mom and my husband works long shifts. The thought of being home alone, with or without my kids, literally makes my skin crawl. I keep trying to make it through the day but every single time I have to have someone come over to be with me.

I don’t know how to get past this, but I am so so tired of it. Anybody been in this situation before? I know that it stems from my health anxiety, and since anxiety is so physical when I start to get the symptoms I worry that there’s a medical cause and that something is going to happen to me with no other adult around to help. My therapist has kind of been less than helpful lately, it’s like once we got out of total crisis mode she stopped helping as much."

I've never committed to a thing for a longer period of time, it's not like I get bored or anything it's just that the moment I realise I'll have to put efforts and become better to pursue something (studying or hobby doesn't matter) I immediately give up. 

Procrastination has been a big fucking problem for my entire life. People say that I'm an above average student but that's only because I can grasp the knowledge quicker. If I didn't have that ability I'd be several grades behind. I literally cannot bring myself to read no matter how hard I try. When I clear my time, sit down try to not have any distractions- Wait my nails are too long, let me cut them... Oof now my hands are too dry let me use lotion... Now they're too sweaty let me clean them... This place is too warm let's switch on the AC- Nope now it's too cold, let's wear a sweater, now I feel itchy- 

I've seen people complain about not being able to focus on studying or work. But what about hobbies? Hell even a small article about gardening I CANNOT BRING MYSELF TO READ IT FULLY. I can feel my stomach burning with impatience I wish I had the ability to copy text or videos within one second or some shit lol. Ugh it's been a big problem for me for a very long time.

I also got AFIB due to not using my CPAP. But that is gone now and for now I am all clear. So I panicking about my palpitations and I was like maybe I’m on too much blood pressure meds so I took my BP… while panicking 220/130…. Total panic went to ER stayed overnight nothing wrong left at 140/90 still some anxiety. I do not drink a lot maybe once a week, but when I do drink I have no fear. I am like I am ready to go to the doctor and test it all. I need that in pill form… I take Prozac and Wellbutrin and clonopin as needed. I have to go to the dr Thursday for a follow up and I am dreading it…  palpitations while typing this. Anyone have any suggestions on anything? I am sure the doctor is going to add buspar as she brought it up before. TIA"

18wrzd8,Anxiety,2024-01-02,Had an anxiety attack I think...,"So to explain the situation I'm a college student and I also joined this club of our campus to improve myself as I am an introverted person. Became an event organizer. Never had prior experience and I am a first year. So I had to organize an upcoming project for campus students...asked advices from the presentations, VP everyone possible to have a smooth beginning, shared a coming soon flyer immediately got blamed by our advisor for not informing her? Like no one told me to....had to take down the advertisements, got blamed by the president...so yeah night is going great...
Look I know it's not big of a deal but ughh...just wanted to vent because I don't know may be cuz I feel not good. I know it's part of life we need to grow up and everything but damn like why do I feel like this even though I know it's not a big deal?"
18wrpt2,Anxiety,2024-01-02,Zoloft withdrawal?,"Hello all, on 2 Dec 2023 I was prescribed 50mg of Zoloft per day for my health anxiety. The first day I took 25 mg and I had a severe reaction to it - insomnia, severe dizziness, very bad headaches, nausea, bad mood etc. So due to this, I decided to start with 12.5 mg. For the next few days I was taking just 12.5 mg but for some reason I was having the same severe effects. I took my last dose on the 6th of December when I just couldn't take it anymore and decided to stop it. A week after I started getting these weird ice pick headaches which were very weird (I normally don't get headaches). After that I started getting other symptoms which were almost the same as when I was on Zoloft - dizzy spells, nausea, irritability, insomnia, all of which remain till now. I called up my prescribing physician and he told me that it is impossible that these symptoms are withdrawals as I was taking it for too short amount of time and it is likely rebound anxiety.
This is very weird because a couple of years ago I was prescribed Zoloft again for the same reason (50mg each day) however back then I had no side effects when I was starting it. Additionally, I was feeling pretty good on it back then and I took it for an year and had no issues stopping it (tapered off and had no withdrawals). 
For the record, on the 15 Nov 2023 I had a full body medical examination (blood work, cardio etc.) and everything was perfect. 
So my question is whether it is possible that I am experiencing withdrawals or side effects from taking it just for 4 days? My anxiety has never caused me such symptoms even on my worst days. Thanks in advance!"
18wrnul,Anxiety,2024-01-02,Will it ever get better?,I’m probably going to have to quit my job. This will be the second one I’ve quit due to anxiety. I used to be just fine working but something happened and I’m never not anxious with work. I’m taking medications and have been taking them and different types and combinations for years. This struggle is one of the hardest things I’ve had to deal with in my life. How can I make a living if I’m too afraid to work? What happens to people like me? I can’t sustain a job with my mental health this bad. Everything feels hopeless and out of control. What hope is there for me?

After work when I get home I usually have lunch that lie down for a few minutes, but almost everytime I fall asleep I wake up with dreading anxiety: heart pounding, chest and stomatch tightness.

18wpup0,Anxiety,2024-01-02,Motivation,"Hello guys,

I feel this subreddit can help me the most since many of you are active here. My story is that I’m a person who has been struggling for years with the motivation to do things, such as tasks around the home, watching TV, and sticking to a routine. I find it very difficult, and it’s getting worse every year. I graduated with a master’s degree after enduring a difficult time in college, where it took me seven years to complete my undergraduate degree. The master’s program was challenging as well, with a heavy reliance on group projects that I managed to survive.. I would say I was just lucky to finish school. I feel so frustrated because I’m turning 30 this year, and I have not changed; I’m not as motivated as I used to be when I was younger. There was a period in my life when I had difficulty writing emails; I was forcing myself, and to this day, I can force myself to do things. I saw a psychiatrist last week, and she said I have anxiety and prescribed Prozac. I’ve been trying for years to figure out what’s going on with me and still can’t. I’m also afraid to take the medication. I do have anxiety sometimes, but it’s not constant, and I don’t feel it interferes with my daily life. I get anxiety when there are triggers, which are not daily. What’s going on with me? is it laziness? I’m desperate for help I want to change and function like any adult 😔"

190ld1r,Anxiety,2024-01-07,How do I deal with health anxiety/hypochondria?,"Since I was little, I've always been scared of the doctors. Getting a shot or my blood drawn doesn't freak me out... it's the results I will get after that make me anxious. Maybe because I fear death, not sure. Growing up I kinda ate unhealthy but nothing crazy, just a kid being a kid, but my mom use to always say ""you're gonna get cancer from these things"" which engrained into my head and freaked me out. Not blaming her but I think that's really what started this. Then fast forward to about age 16-17, I was diagnosed with severe anemia to the point where it led to a cancer scare (leukemia). I'm F22 btw. Luckily, I didn't have leukemia but after that my hypochondria got worse. I think almost any feeling of discomfort is something medically serious and I don't know what to do to fix it. I haven't gone to therapy and I'm not on any medication and maybe I'm just in a state of denial right now, but I don't want to turn to those options just yet without finding other solutions first. Anyone have any advice or personal experience? "
190k26e,Anxiety,2024-01-07,Travel anxiety??,"Bad anxiety when I travel?

Long story short.. idk if it's the whole bringing back memories from when my parents were divorced and me not having a real home or room at both places to call my own and hating going back and forth (home sick, I already hate traveling away from home) or something completely different. 

I am 29, I have a husband and 3 kids. It doesn't matter who we visit .. my mom, my dad, my in laws, my aunt, friends... I always end up with the runs and tummy cramps and gargles all night on night one... Never fails.  We stay in a hotel.. I'm 100% fine. I've never changed anything in my diet.. nothing. 

I may have more anxiety cause I mean... Getting 3 kids and a husband out that door and hoping no one barfs in the vehicle or all weekend yea, I have higher anxiety.. but nothing our of the normal here. 


What can I do to help/ prevent it. We have a friend's baby shower on a farm to go to in a few weeks and I'm already nervous if it'll happen again."
190jn3m,Anxiety,2024-01-07,Fear of bowl / colon cancer,"So, for several months I've had binge eating problems, where I eat too much and then usually skip dinner. I end up having discomfort, to the point it persists into the next day, there hasn't been any extreme weight-related gain either. My stomach will remain sore and feel full even an entire day after eating.

My great uncle died of bowl cancer in 2004, at around age 70. I'm terrified, these symptoms have been going on for months, to the point I can't drink alcohol and have to stop just before drunkness is induced. My stomach just feels full and sore all the time. I've cut back my food intake and aligned with a fairly normal diet for the last day or two, but it hasn't worked. I still feel full and sore.

My doctor examined my stomach a few months ago, pressed down on it, and blood tests were conducted, all were negative. I stopped thinking about this for the most part, but my stomach hasn't improved and became worse and worse as the binge-eating worsened. It obviously has improve, but hasn't seemed to make a difference. My stools vary from thin to large, dark and light, sometimes with Mucus but no blood for the last few weeks. I always feel ill, bloated, full, and even nauseous.

I've cried wolf far too often now, so Mum won't believe me. I am due for a medical check-up soon, but I'm concerned for the worst."
190jcap,Anxiety,2024-01-07,I’m so sick of health anxiety.,"It all started in 2018 when I was depressed and my doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin. It worked great for a few weeks until we upped my dose, where I began having severe panic attacks that lasted basically 24/7 until we switched to Zoloft. I’m not sure why Wellbutrin did this to me, but it was the catalyst for panic attacks. I had never truly had one before, but it terrified me. I was certain I was dying. Ever since then, I struggle with major health anxiety because I’ve never quite felt normal since that time. It’s like a switch flipped in my brain and caused permanent damage. I now have panic attacks fairly regularly and I’m so scared that doctors are missing something vital. In the last several years, I’ve been obsessively seeing my doctor and luckily managed to stop myself and I haven’t been since September. But I can’t get over the feeling that somethings seriously wrong with me and my doctors are ignoring it. I often get told I’m “only 30” so the likelihood of something being wrong isn’t high. But I guess to my demise, I spend a lot of time scrollling TikTok and seeing tons of young women my age being diagnosed with late stage cancers that were dismissed as anxiety. I fucking hate this. Every ache and pain in my body is a nightmare. I’ll overthink it for months. In September, I had a breast lump checked via ultrasound and they told me it was nothing but my armpit lymph node was “thickened” (whatever that means) but the doctors weren’t concerned. Does anyone else experience this? I feel literally insane. For awhile I obsessed over enlarged lymph nodes in my neck that turned out to just be my fucking salivary glands."
190isvv,Anxiety,2024-01-07,Tormenting myself everyday over something that happened 20 years ago and was out of my control.,"First I must start saying that I love animals, I am a vet and working with them is literally what keeps me alive. The last years I have developed extreme sensibility to anything that includes animal suffering or cruelty. I deal with BPD so most of the time these feelings are overwhelming enough to make me feel dizzy and like fainting. 

Anyway, when I was a kid, around 20 years ago, I witnessed a car rolling over a stray dog, while other stray dog ran after the car because its friend was being dragged by the wheel. At the moment this was bad but I think my mind blocked this memory, until about a year ago when someone was telling me a similar experience and this memory came to my mind, I felt so bad to the point I almost fainted, I blame myself over it because I think why I didn’t yell to the car, why didn’t I stop it, why I did nothing. The logical part of me thinks I was a kid but, I still feel extremely bad, this disturbing memory comes to my mind at nights and I’m unable to sleep, I just cry and cry and feel as if my chest is being burnt. At the moment I cannot go to therapy because I’m not in my country and receiving therapy in a different language doesn’t work for me. I would like advice on how can I rationalize this or at least, let it go and stop blaming myself over it, the burden of this memory is just too much for me. English is not my first language so I’m sorry for any mistakes, and thank you in advance."

190d4wo,Anxiety,2024-01-06,Mental Health,"Can social anxiety cause you to ramble and say things that are not true. Sometimes when I’m having a conversation I will randomly say something that’s not true, but when I’m saying it I think it is. I’m not trying to lie or meaning to say something that’s not true. I wanna stop doing it but don’t know what’s even causing it. It’s making me feel like a horrible person and making me feel like a “liar”. I recently just did it again and it’s all I have been thinking about.

190c6l2,Anxiety,2024-01-06,Whats wrong with my heart?,"Maybe nothing. Maybe something. Idk. 

So I’ve been pretty inactive for this entire year. Most days not even getting in 1000 steps. I’ve put weight on too not sure if that just from being inactive or from a health issue (I have some other issues/concerns). 

My heart races from pretty much anything. My resting rate is anywhere from 75-95. If I’m relaxed in bed if usually 70 something. Once I get up it usually goes up like 30 beats. I’ve noticed that when I stand it won’t go below like 100ish and I don’t like that at all. Any exercise makes it go up a ton. Walking it’s usually around 120. If I go up stairs it can hit 150. If I carry heavy things it can hit 160 or higher, highest it hit is 180. This is really affecting me because I feel like I can’t do anything. I usually have to sit down to try and calm it dow. I get it, it’s my fault for being so  inactive but I’m just trying to make sure I’m okay. 

I want to be active and exercise but when my heart rate gets high like that it makes me feel sick. Sometimes it’ll make me feel like I’m going to have a panic attack when obviously I’m not. I just don’t know how to lower my rate so I can actually do things. I shoveled outside earlier and my heart rate was pretty much between 140-150 the entire time. I hate this so much. I used to be so active and have so much fun outside. Now I dread just getting up because I hate the way it feels with my heart racing while I’m literally standing doing nothing. I literally feel like I’m killing myself and I really want to change that. 

If you’re going to comment about health anxiety please don’t comment. I’m not anxious over my heart beat I’m just wondering if it’s all my inactivity or if something more could be going on. I also don’t constantly check it sometimes I can just really feel my heart beating and I usually check to make sure it’s not beating to fast. At 180 I start to feel like I’ll pass out."

I went to therapy for a year, until I realized that my therapist was an absolute bitch and I hate some stuff she told me, so I dropped.

I’m still trying to do many stuff, I have changed careers that are well known in my country and very profitable yet I have this itch in the back of my mind. A felling that I should be doing something else or something more productive or what I’m doing is completely useless and pointless. Like my brain is never okay with anything. Like what I’m doing isn’t the perfect time or I’m not doing it correctly. No matter what I do, it won’t go away and I just go through the motions trying to do my best and enjoy my hobbies and everything else as much as I can do.

We’re extremely close friends, and we hang out everyday after work. Yesterday, we had a conversation where we shared our past traumas that we have never told anyone. 

Later at night, we had a two hour phone call and it went great. She’s getting a new cat so she asked me if I could help her clean up her apartment over the weekend. We had also made plans for dinner on Friday.

After work, I called her but she didn’t respond so I texted her asking her if she’s home. She responded a couple of hours later and said she was back home but she was doing errands when I called her so the dinner never happened.

I was okay with it so I told her I would be at her place at 10 on Saturday for the cleaning but she said she’s already done the cleaning and I don’t have to worry about it. She hasn’t texted me back after this. 

Im so anxious about all of this, it’s driving me crazy. Did I do anything wrong?? I more concerned about whether she’s okay than anything.

18yjr3e,Anxiety,2024-01-04,feels impossible recovering,"last year was one of the worst years i’ve experienced mentally so naturally this year i made it a goal do do what’s best for my mind and it’s easier said than done. i’ve gained a lot of wisdom and advice throughout last year after such and uphill battle with anxiety/depression/adhd and it was a huge learning experience. i recieved lots of advice from my therapist and learned a lot about myself and the way anxiety affects me, or what happens leading up to me dealing with anxiety/stress/depression but my anxious mind literally feels impenetrable. 

i feel like i cannot think differently or do whats best for my body or my mind because of the way i’ve gotten so used the comfort that my anxiety provides, even though it’s so stress inducing. even if it does result in me reaching “success”. it feels like falling to a cushion safeguarding my fall yet being shot at all the way down. however if i do reach success, there will be a lot of blame for ever have been doing it so anxiously

i’m mainly referring to my overthinking which is the worst thing i’m a victim to. for example, i feel like my mental capacity overall sucks, so i tend to overthink a lot. when i overthink, i’ll remind myself not to but then i’ll feel like if i don’t, i’ll dissociate and start to under think which makes me feel like i need to rely on the anxious overthinking which always ends up giving me a huge headache

anyways, it seems i can’t do anything mentally correct for myself and it’s getting really tough. i know what to do and how to do it but i just can’t. i’m too prone to my comfort zone and i’m not sure how to stop. it sucks because i’m so self aware about it all and i wish i wasn’t. nothing i do anxiously is something i can ever just slide right off. i hold all these negative beliefs of myself too which make me feel like i can’t achieve stress free success. i don’t even know if i make sense. i don’t even think writing this post is good for me. anxiety fucking sucks"

I've just got a static post after being on rotations for 2.5 years. Basically I spent that time doing my job in three different places to gain experience

Now on Friday I am starting a static job where I'll be permanent in one place

I know that having over two years experience should mean I'll be good and confident but I really don't feel that. Because it was in different areas I feel like it doesn't consolidate and I only actually have 9 months experience in the area I'm returning to

Since I was hired the senior of my position has left so I'll be the only one of me in the place and this has my imposter syndrome in overdrive

I feel like I know nothing and my incompetence won't be shielded by having a senior to work with or run things past like I always have had 

There are so many unknowns and I don't know who will give me supervision (1:1s) or who will be my manager

I have also relocated for this role and moved in on Monday and I keep thinking if the job goes horribly I've uprooted my life for it and could be left with nothing

How do I handle this fear of being a fuck up and being found out? I feel like because the senior has left and my post has been empty for ages that they'll really be counting on me and I'll fuck up. I interview really well and I feel like there will be high hopes for my arrival

What do I do?"

18x3oo6,Anxiety,2024-01-02,Can physical symptoms come back even after going away for a bit?,"I've already made a post here awhile ago explaining body issues (mainly lower abdominal pressure/pain and aches all over) I've had due to anxiety and ever since, I've feeling better and my body has gotten somewhat normal again 

but recently, a few of the symptoms such as the lower stomach pain/bloating and even sudden lightheadedness that I thought were gone have come back even after I thought I was feeling better (I also developed a bit of a cold, which did lead to some health anxiety thoughts, and worrying about other things in my life, such as school and family issues)

So is it possible for physical symptoms of anxiety to come back even after a week or two of being gone and you also haven't been feeling as anxious as of late?"

18wphf0,Anxiety,2024-01-02,Constant Anxiety/OCD,"I (22f) have had anxiety since I was very young and you’d think I’d have a grasp on it and my body but I just don’t. OCD I’ve been officially diagnosed with since around 14-15. This is one of the first times I’m unmedicated in years, due to the fact that most of the medications have given me annoying side effects that make it hard and there’s not many more options. These last two weeks have been so hard. I was in literal crisis for a bit of it. I do think I’ve made little progress and then I just take a stepback. Im also an insomniac so the little sleep does not help my case. I do have sleep meds but my anxiety does not let me take them due to fear, even though I’ve taken them several times before. I’m in therapy now and it’s given me a bit of relief but we haven’t been able to meet in the last week or two and I don’t think I have another appointment til next week. 

I’m just tired. Today I accidentally sent a rude text to my boss because of having a migraine and being so on edge from my anxiety for it. I apologized and she hasn’t responded and I can’t stop panicking. I only got a few hours off so I have to go in and I’m so anxious I feel like I’m going to vomit, which obviously has not helped my migraine. Work is super stressful. I work reception at a therapy office and am often the front line crisis responder when nobody is available and it’s super hard to deal with when you’re already anxious yourself and zero training.

I just want a hug. I don’t like being touched usually due to contamination but I just want somebody to reach out to me and tell me it will be okay and to just give me a hug. I want to feel safe and loved. 

Meditation is nice when it’s really bad, but I can only focus so much before my body goes panic mode again. Taking walks helps a lot but it’s literally 20 degrees outside. Does anyone know of any other random things that help?"

22/yo Female here. For as long as I can remember I have struggled with health anxiety (mainly heart related) but includes other things too. I think it began at age 8 or so and has become better or worse sporadically over the years. I struggled really badly at age 12 ish for a while after a girl in my class had a seizure. It got to the point where I couldn’t even go to school because I was terrified that I too would have a seizure. Eventually this fizzled out and I think I was anxiety free for a couple of years however it has come back with vengeance over the past year, and I am so so disappointed to be starting 2024 hiding in my bed while on a ski trip with friends because I am too terrified to ski due to heart related worries. (Side note: my toe is also broken which is an inconvenience but I could definitely manage to ski on it as the pain is minimal. However I am now using my broken toe as an excuse to hide in the room). My heart was racing like crazy last night and I couldn’t sleep and mentioned it to my friend this morning thinking that she would say “oh yeah I get that sometimes” but she was like “No I’ve never had that”. I reckon it’s simply a symptom of anxiety itself. I quit my favourite sport this year because I felt like I was experiencing dizziness during it, and I think it has really taken a toll on my mental health as it has caused weight gain and I used to struggle with an ED (but that’s a whole other story). I could say so much more about all of this but please if anyone has any advice on how to manage HA as I cannot live like this anymore, it is paralysing and it consumes so much of my thoughts and life."

18wm1wq,Anxiety,2024-01-02,I'm afraid of losing my mom,"I am writing this through an automatic translator. This year I will turn 20 years old. My mother (she’s soon 51) and my cat and I moved to another city because I went to university. I have four more years to study. We rent a very small studio apartment.

all was good. we moved in August, my life went on, I studied and met new people. my mother always dreamed of moving to this city. my grandparents stayed in a city two hours from mine. my grandfather is very sick. two weeks ago I heard my uncle say that he would probably die soon. and then it hit me. first, the realization of his possible death came to me, then the realization of the move, then memories from my childhood, from our family’s home, when we were all together, began to pop up in my head. just 7 years ago. it amazed me

For a week now I have been waking up and going to sleep with the fear of losing my mother. Now she supports us alone and rents an apartment. in the next few years she wants to save up for our own apartment here. 
I can’t eat, I can’t get out of bed, I can’t sleep, I’m shaking and pictures of the past flash before my eyes. I cry, I cry, I look at my mother and cry again. I can't come to terms with reality. I can't come to terms with the fact that I've grown up. I can’t accept that the only people who live for me and for who I live for will one day die. I see no meaning in my life and no meaning in my future. I have no friends, I have no hobbies, everything I can think about cannot compensate for the reality that awaits me and in which I live. I've never felt this way, I'm just consumed by fear. It seems that not a single existing event, not a single existing object in this world can ever bring me happiness. I do not know what to do

Today I had a dream about my mother. I woke up crying while my mom was watching TV. 6 hours have already passed, I fell asleep and woke up several times. even now all I see is memories and fear. crazy fear. i don't know what to do"
18wlvxc,Anxiety,2024-01-02,"Hi, I am afraid of change..","Hi, I'm a 22y/F. I have constant anxiety and feel like I'm in a constant state of flight or fight. There are a  lot of issues in my family which trigger my anxiety. Most of the energy of my family members goes towards my sibling because of their recently diagnosed mental health issues I understand my family's situation but no matter how much I try I feel like I'm not needed and am no ones priority. But this post is not about that. I have always felt safe in my home and that's the only place that gives me any sort of warmth or comfort. After the pandemic, my family decided to put the house up for sale and throughout that period i felt constantly depressed and low. This went on for a year until they decided to put it off the market. The relief that I felt then,, I cannot explain it in words. But today I overheard my parents talking about someone coming over to have a look at the place and when I asked my mum about it she refused to give me any clarity. Now I'm paranoid that they might have put the house on the market again. My heart sinks every time something like this comes up. My home is the only thing/place that I'm attached to and feel at ease in. The issues in my family as well as my past experiences with friends have never allowed to be comfortable with anyone and I am extremely attached to this tangible property. I don't know if I'm being selfish by pushing my family again and again to not sell the house. But that's the only thing I believe I have. I'm scared to confront them about it and don't know what to do. I feel powerless and as if nothing is in my control.

I believe that I am scared of change but I don't know how to cope with it. Situations like these push me down a rabbit hole. I constantly feel like I'm not needed or wanted anywhere and that's the reason why I try to find that comfort at home where I can be myself, with my self. Even though I cry almost every time I enter my room after a fight or a confrontation, I still cannot let go of it."

18wlbba,Anxiety,2024-01-02,Feel like I can’t deal with it no more,"So I’ve had anxiety pretty much all my life but since Covid it has escalated pretty bad. 

After returning to work from lockdown I ended up going on the sick for almost 6 months due to having chest pains every day, turns out it was panic attacks. I got given sertraline which I felt didn’t help and then beta blockers to help with the physical symptoms which don’t help. 

Everything now just seems like a struggle. At work I struggle and feel like walking out. Today I feel like breaking down. I cant do simple stuff that I used to like doing. 

I’ve been struggling with this now for three years and the only thing that really keeps me going are my children, which after spending all Christmas with and now I’m back at work has made my anxiety escalate even further. 

Countless times I’ve been tempted to quit work and take my kids out of nursery so I would be eligible for some help from the government as they are 2 and 3 but I can’t pull my self to take them away from there as they enjoy it so much.

I took a bunch of delta 8 edibles unfortunately and got really high.

I was playing fortnite with my friends and then took my headphones off and heard distant voices and footsteps I couldn't make out what they were saying (I live in an apartment complex and drank a monster). 
When I put my headphones back on I couldn't hear them.

I then went to go to bed and could not tell if what I was hearing was coming from my head or apartment noise I was also really high. 

It was pretty scary in the moment.
No visual side effects, lingering side effects after the high or delusional side effects. I felt completely normal the next day.

My doctor believes I did not experience psychosis.

I am scared this will comeback or become something chronic. I keep googling horror stories about psychosis and now I have crippling anxiety and panic attacks.

Thanks in advance.

18wkygu,Anxiety,2024-01-02,"""Peripheral Vision "" anxiety","So I'm wondering how common this issue is. I'm 22, but since I was around 17 maybe, I've had what I'm calling ""Peripheral Vision anxiety. "" Basically if someone is in my peripheral vision, I get anxious that they're looking at me, or that they think I'm looking at them. It gradually gets worse, until I leave the situation, but if I return, I won't be able to stop thinking about it, and it will continue. It feels pretty similar to an intrusive thought. I've had a similar issue once, where I was talking to this girl with big boobs. It's ridiculous. I didn't want to look at her boobs, so I mentally tried to be certain that I would not do that, but then I become paranoid that I actually am looking at her boobs. And then I'm worrying what I must look like to her. 

It seems goofy, but this sort of thing was quite debilitating. I still don't leave the house much, but this issue made it difficult to be around a lot of people, like while watching a movie, or eating with family at the dining table. I'm now on antidepressants, which have helped, along with therapy, though I still have this a bit, it's just not quite as bad.

But I'm curious, do you guys relate?"
18wkvto,Anxiety,2024-01-02,Struggling with social interaction with my closest friends,"Happy new years everyone! This post is just a summary of my (23M) thoughts after I’ve been noticing some weird behavior in myself recently. Would appreciate any advice on the matter.

To start, it was New Year's Eve and I went out to the bars with my friends, who I would say I'm very close with (Hang out with them multiple times a week). Additionally there were some other people who I admittedly didn't know as well, but they were still friendly and had a good idea of who I was. The night started and when we got to the bar, I would say I was at a very low level of drunk (probably 2/10 on a scale), since I didn't feel like drinking too heavily at the pregame. 

For some more added context, at the pregame (my house) I was mostly to myself and only really talked to my closest 1 or 2 friends when I had the chance. I felt more comfortable sitting alone in the other room or finding a random task to do (i.e. cleaning up some small trash pieces off the floor), and didn't feel very inclined to mingle with some of the newer people in the group. Also, I'm generally a friendly, approachable, and caring person.

So when we got to the bar, I just generally felt awkward and that I was in my head too much; I can't really dance so I didn't really have great energy/vibes with the rest of the group, and the thought of socializing with people felt like a task. Fast forwarding a bit, I got some drinks in me and then the regular enjoyable feeling of being with my friends commenced as it usually is with alcohol (no surprise), and we had a fun New Year's Eve. 

Later on we ended up at another friend's house where we hung out a bit longer, eventually ending up on the couch for conversation. I was sitting there taking everything in and trying to participate in conversation where I could, but eventually felt annoyed and that I wasn't very engaged in what was happening. After a while I left the room to go sit by the kitchen countertop and nobody really said anything so I was just bored, sitting there. I had a random thought enter my head which was to go outside and just take in the quiet air, and be to myself. I ended up just laying on the concrete driveway looking up at the sky, feeling chilly but at peace knowing I was out of that environment for a bit. I listened to some music on my phone, and after a bit my friends came looking for me.

Part of me wanted my friends to dart out and ask where I was; for them to give me attention perhaps. However the other part of me was just enjoying the serenety of the night sky (it was between 3-5am so I could ahve also just been very tired, being the cause of this behavior). After being there for a while I came back in, and returned to the couch. I stayed and talked a bit but eventually the same looming feeling of uncomfortability came over me and I felt compelled to go back outside, to my safe concrete haven in the driveway. I did the same thing again, and my friend came out in a panic wondering what happened/where I was. 

This is a lot of potentially unnecessary context for me to pose the questions: Does this behavior exhibit signs of social anxiety? Am I experiencing spotlight effect? Why do I feel  uncomfortable at times around my friends when I know and love these guys? I feel often intimidated when I'm in a larger group of people; it's harder to be myself and blend in to the conversation. 

My hunch is that I'm in my head too much overanalyzing things when I should cease the thinking as often, and just be apart of the moment. However for me that seems hard since I have such an analytical mind. Overall my wish is to just be more comfortable and not awkward in normal social interactions, and it puzzles me that recently I haven't felt as inclined to be outwardly social with my friends who I already know so well. Any thoughts on this story, my behavior, or what you guys think would be greatly appreciated! Thanks so much if you read this far and have a great one!"

18wkn1h,Anxiety,2024-01-02,Buspirone Help,"Hi all
I’ve been going through it and was just looking for anyone else on here who might have had issues similar and survived. 5 months ago I stopped a sleeping pill/blood pressure pill cold turkey not knowing it would be a problem( totally my fault and definitely not my smartest move) which resulted in me having an insane panic attack. Went to the ER where they gave me an antipsychotic thinking I was having a psychotic break. I wasn’t and that medicine drove me through the roof and then some. I went and saw my doctor after that and got prescribed  buspirone but so far I haven’t seen anyone get prescribed it like I was. Doc put me on 30mg immediately and split it up 5 mg every 5 hours meaning I had to wake up middle of the night and take it. For the first month or so I was so nauseous I couldn’t stand and slept through that month (I truly don’t even remember it) after that I had my heart slamming in my chest I couldn’t breath I couldn’t stop crying I couldn’t stand for very long without wanting to pass out and was still so nauseous. Finally after 3 months of being told I would be fine and I would even out I called and said I can’t do this any more because I was starting to get extremely dark thoughts and my body wanted to keel over just sitting up. Doc told me they could no longer help me and told me to go to another doctor which I did. New doctor didn’t understand why 1st doc not only had me on so much but why I was taking it so much and wanted me to immediately go down to 2 pills a day ( 10mg) for a week and then 1 a week(5mg) and then start a different med. I tried to go down to 2 and 2 days later had an absolute break down. Uncontrollable panic attack. I ended up going back up to 30mg and am now dropping down by 5mg every week or 2 but my skin is on fire and I’m still having trouble breathing. I finally stopped crying and started being able to control my own thoughts and feelings a bit. Since starting this I’ve still had my heart slamming(feels like almost a heart attack) and persistent anxiety. I’ve never been through something like this in my life and all for a panic attack I had from another pill. No problems before that. Now I’m struggling to get off a pill I feel like I should have never been put on in the first place. Has anyone,  anyone at all been through anything like this. I know I’ll get through it if I keep on pushing but this feels almost unbearable and I was wondering if anyone else made it out."

What do I do???,"First off, I need to address the fact that this post is absolutely everywhere and was definitely an anxiety dump, I'm looking for advice and opinions on what I should do with my current situation. PLEASE understand that this might be hard to read, and I'd appreciate no negativity on my grammar and/or organization lol thanks guys.

I am literally so stressed out right now, and am definitely procrastinating right now, but I have no motivation to get my classes up and honestly all I want to do is sleep away all my problems. It doesn't really help that I have PTSD nightmares and am struggling to get into a rem sleep stage. I can't get my meds changed until the 5th of January.

I am currently enrolled in online schooling. I joined about 3-4 weeks ago which was right before the deadline that I had access to help from my teachers. Its now been about 10 days and i have been trying so hard to find the motivation and discipline to get myself to wake up and do at least a few assignments.

This might sound like I'm just not that good of a student but up until this year I have been a straight A student but had to go online after being hospitalized for a month 1/2. I've had to have my mom help me with keeping up with my very low maintenance cat. And I haven't been going out with friends or anything like that. I truly am just so exhausted, and I struggle with handling stress.

I've also (somewhat recently) been diagnosed with schizophrenia, which is making my already severe paranoia worse because now I'm questioning every little thing in my life. I'm also going back to my (somewhat higher level) high school next week. 

Now that it is technically the 2nd I have until 11:59 PM to submit as many assignments as I can. I really need advice on what to do. I'm contemplating going to bed right now, waking up in the morning and doing as much as I can for my main courses, and if i still manage to not get my grades to passing, possibly just do online summer school to get the credits back. Should I do that?

18wjmhk,Anxiety,2024-01-02,anxiousness in silent situations,"whenever i am with someone else, or worse, many people, in a silent room, i get really anxious. this stems from a few times that my stomach started growling during school tests which was super embarrassing. but now, even when i am full, i get really nervous that my stomach might start making noises. and because of my extreme anxiety, my stomach is more inclined to make noises. so im sort of stuck in an endless cycle lol. i cannot focus on anything else, and often i’m silently hyperventilating from anxiety even though i know nothing will happen if i don’t worry in the first place.

this has been going on since august and has been absolutely horrible for me because i’m in high school and have tests/ quizzes multiple times a week and of course lectures where the class is silent almost every day. i don’t know what to do, i’ve tried small exercises to calm my anxiety when it happens but it rarely works because i feel like i’m overly aware of everything. 

this year of school has also been the most stressful i’ve had and i feel mild anxiety/ stress at home too, but nothing compared to the nervousness in silent situations. can anyone help?"

It was my great grandmother and I remember crying so much but I couldn’t really grasp the concept of it so I don’t think I would be able to handle any of my loved ones dying now. 

I am 16 and recently i’ve been having such bad anxiety that I’m going to lose someone in my family and thinking about it makes me have anxiety attacks and breakdowns to where I sit there and cry and act like they’ve actually passed away. I get really bad anxiety about my grandma , my mom, my siblings, and even my dog.

Im unemployed (have a job for my campus technically but its only 8-10 hrs a week) and in college and im trying to be more proud of myself and see myself as competent and not a stupid kid but im having trouble. 

But there is a problem, my brain has a new excuse it has cooked up a new excuse on why this cant be the case. So since i still rely on my parents financially, i live at home when im not on campus, dont need to pay rent, and they pay half my college fees. I get food, video games and pay 125 dollars a month for car insurence and that is about it.

Im an anxious person who is not sure of themself, if i didnt have my family's help im not sure i would have made it or would be going anywhere. Basically i feel like a kid still and i dont know how to be a ""true"" adult despite turning 21 in a few months. All my mental struggles and trials seem stupid and not important, some of my peers are already employed and supporting themselves, they dont need anyone else and dont owe anyone anything.

I also was told in a class last semseter the biggest predictor of success in college is socioeconomic standing, which definetly gives my fears validation. Overall im conflicted, idk how to feel competent while being a little unsure of myself and relying on my parents, i dont think id even go to college if they didnt help me pay for it, honestly. That fact makes me feel spineless and have no resolve too"

I also have bipolar and get scared because when i get anxious, my intrusive thoughts come out and I’m sure I’m going to go off 

This is the second time I’ve called 911 to take me to the hospital because I’ve been so scared and thought I’d do something to me or someone else. Both times they run tests (because to me it doesn’t feel like anxiety, or i tell myself that) that come back fine and tell me it’s anxiety and send me home after giving me fluids and anxiety pills

Another thing with my anxiety is i don’t eat or drink a lot because i forget and then i get dizzy and lightheaded with the anxiety, puke, etc and i get dehydrated. I almost passed out in the ER, my heart rate gets super high (like 160-180 range) when i spiral 

It’s so scary because it makes me sure im going to die, or that my bipolar is going to make me have an epispde 

I’m 27, a female. Me and my separated in August and I’m still dealing with that. First attack was the beginning of nov and now today. 

I just hate feeling this way. I was on zoloft a few years ago but my anxiety/depression wasn’t as bad then. They told me to call my doctor tomorrow and get back in, so I’m definitely going to do that, but this just sucks

18wh9ww,Anxiety,2024-01-02,Navigating complex family dynamics as the new year begins,"
On New Year's Eve, coincidentally my father's birthday, things were going well until he became intoxicated, using profanity and behaving recklessly. Despite decades of discussions about his drinking problem, it persists. While he has improved over his lifetime. When he drinks alcohol it changes who he is, and being almost 20 weeks pregnant makes me hesitant about bringing a child into a world where my father acts like a child himself. Contemplating distancing myself further and minimizing contact throughout the year, unlike my understanding brother, I struggle to accept his behavior due to past traumas. Recognizing this avoidance pattern, I'm seeking advice on enhancing my well-being in this challenging situation.

Note: Even if I address my father about his poor behavior, he's unlikely to change; he's set in his ways. Observing my brother's understanding and forgiveness, despite enduring childhood trauma caused by our father, highlights a contrast. And making me wonder if I’m handling things wrong, which in turn is making me question myself as a mother-to-be. While I thought I had moved past those issues, my fathers behavior still triggers and upsets me. It might be more of a personal challenge for me than a problem with him.

On New Year's Day, I approached him to address my discomfort with what happened, intending to take a step back with how often I visit. I felt the need to voice my concerns openly. However, it didn't go as planned. 

The interaction unfolded like this: as I walked down the stairs, he remained silent. Time passed, my husband appeared, and he asked him how he was doing. Later, to start the conversation, I pointed out that he hadn't asked me how I was doing. He responded with profuse apologies without really answering my question, to which I said I didn't need apologies but tried to proceed with discussing his behavior from the previous night. He defensively claimed he did nothing wrong and stormed off before I could finish my thoughts. 

Now my husband is telling me I was too upset/petty and I shouldn’t have started the conversation by saying “you’re not going to ask me how I am”. And if I’m honest I’ve told him all about all my childhood traumas but he doesn’t understand it, so it’s a really lonely feeling right now. 

I feel like I’m truly alone. And I need to figure this out my self and I have no support. Either they tell me I’m too upset (even though I’m speaking calmly/not swearing), too angry, too opinionated. Im constantly hearing excuses for my father’s bad behaviour. 

At this point I’m not going back to my parents while he’s there. Seeking perspectives or thoughts."

18wh5mf,Anxiety,2024-01-02,Just got diagnosed,"25M. Went to the er last night for what I guess was another panic attack. They ran all the heart tests again for the 7th time and everything was normal. They gave me some Ativan which helped a lot but didn’t completely make my hr go down. They also prescribed it to me for the next ten days, 1mg twice a day. 

Anyone have experience with lorazepam? I feel pretty dizzy but much calmer after I take it. I know you can’t stay on the benzos for a long time so I’m trying to figure out my next steps. 

Have any of you experienced similar fear relating to your heart/health? I’m afraid to get up and walk around because it feels like my heart rate just skyrockets and I get even more dizzy. I feel trapped on the floor and with my semester starting in a week I’m worried I won’t be able to make it through this. I also have a job lined up I’m scared to lose. 

I have an appointment with a psych on Wednesday but don’t really know what to expect. I never used to get panic attacks, and I was always rock solid when it came to managing my stress and others. Something changed and I’m just afraid I’ll never be who I was before.

I feel a sense of dread, as if something bad will happen. Like someone dying or someone abandoning me. I feel a pit in my stomach &amp; I struggle to breathe. I start to panic &amp; I even feel myself getting irritated because of it. My mind wanders and I have the worst thoughts imaginable. 

My worst fear is taking out this feeling on others. I am really good about not doing that but I have been so worried lately. 

I am usually pretty self aware and can ward off these feelings by using logic &amp; reasoning. Lately these feelings have persisted. I can’t help but fixate on this feeling when it occurs even though it hurts so bad. Part of me wonders if I am self sabotaging. I only say that because I feel like I should be able to push past this feeling, as that’s what I’ve always done. 

It is so important to me that I can be the best version of myself for the people around me. Usually I can put my feelings aside and be present but for some reason I am struggling right now."

18wg5n3,Anxiety,2024-01-02,Hydroxyzine success,"I take lexapro for my anxiety. It helps about 80% of the time. Couldn't recommend it more.

I have hydroxyzine prescribed to me for itching/eczema. I didn't have knowledge of its anxiety properties but I take hydroxyzine before bed and taking it for anxiety sounded like it would make me fall asleep drooling, so I never tried it.

I recently returned from a trip in mexico. I bought some hydroxyzine at the Farmacia there. It was in 10mg doses. I am prescribed 25mg in the states and 25mg was enough to make me fall asleep at my keyboard drooling.

But my arm was itching like mad a few hours ago. I ran out of claritin and I put my cream and shit on it. To no avail, it still itched. So I took 10mg hydroxyzine

I had a job interview for a part time gig (I'm in college) which I was fuckin terrified about. Even though I worked as a MANAGER for the same company and was applying for an entry level position(and left on really, really good terms) I shouldn't have been terrified, I was guaranteed the job. 

But, about 30 minutes after, I was like ""oh shit, I have an interview in an hour""

Off I went. Met with HR. I made her laugh her ass off when I told her some stories about what I did at my old location back in my home city.

I got hired for the maximum amount they could give me per hour, waived the requirements to qualify for the better health insurance plan, was given extra leniency on my schedule, and I have extra PTO

If that isn't a W idk what is

TL;DR 10mg hydroxyzine did not make me super drowsy but it made me nail a fuckin job interview without me even feeling anxious."

I’ve always been an anxious person but my anxiety has increased tremendously over the last two years. I started college and it was stressful but in September I had my first panic attack ever mid presentation and it shook me to my core. One of the most damaging experiences of my life hands down. Over the course of my freshmen year I was put in public speaking situations, nothing big just talking about a small thing for a couple minutes, seminar style. These things began eliciting a panic response as well. I managed to get out of all my presentations freshmen year by calling in sick. I simply wouldn’t have made it through if I tried to do them. I was put on lexapro in December last year to try to help me deal. It didn’t work, I wasn’t happy with my decision to take meds and it just made it worse. I started having panic attacks with introductions in the beginning of spring semester and it’s been downhill from there. In the spring of 2023 I was participating in class often (for some reason raising my hand to speak didn’t bother me) this changed this fall. By the time winter break came in December I can’t even raise my hand to talk without feeling panic. I started Prozac a couple weeks ago and I’m sticking with it this time around. I’m also trying to find a therapist to talk to. My dilemma now is what to do about returning for my spring semester. I’m heavily considering taking medical leave and trying to focus on my mental health. The problem is my partner is at my school, and she is one of the only things keeping me sane. I’m going to be able to see her sometimes but i’m also so worried to put the on thing going well in my life right now in jeopardy. Im kind of freaking out (partially as a side effect of starting meds) but I could really use some advice. Sorry for the essay."

18wfjp5,Anxiety,2024-01-02,Hey everyone! I do t have anxiety but I have a tip!,"So my wife has struggled for years to find some sort of solution, even if it’s temporary, to her anxiety, specifically medical anxiety and while we’ve found some ok solutions such as taking late night drives, we know that’s not always an available option. However, two things recently that have been massive helps and allows to her get to sleep so much easier than anything else she’s tried m, has been foot rubs with lotion and a small drop of lavender essential oil and, surprisingly enough for her, calming puzzle focused video games (she’s the furthest thing from a gamer lol)

The games she’s specifically tried has been the Stanley Parable and Superliminal. They both keep her mind focused while not being overwhelmingly quick or overstimulating with the controls. 

I know these solutions might not work for everyone but using the lotion + lavender combo or playing easy, slow paced puzzle games a few hours before bed have both been game changers for her as of recent and I hope they continue to work for her. 

Seeing anxiety from an outside perspective, I’m so sorry y’all have to deal with this because, it definitely seems exhausting but like I tell my wife, I understand that it might be hard now but the anxiety will pass and everything will be ok. 😊"

18wf2tl,Anxiety,2024-01-02,Left Ear Rings Occasionally (Long Time Health Anxiety Sufferer),"Long time lurker, first time posting here.  This subreddit and many other forums have been a help to me whenever I've had a bout of health anxiety, which is what led me to go on Zoloft in 2014.  Normally, I'm able to keep my anxiety in check, but I've been dealing with some actual health issues the last couple of years that turned out to be the result of Hashimoto's and Hypothyroidism.  I'm currently being treated for that, as well as high blood pressure and high cholesterol (all of these things run in my family). 

Anyway, due to everything I've been through, I feel my anxiety kicking in about an odd symptom.  Ever since a couple of days before Christmas, I've heard a very low, quick ring sound in my left ear.  It's not constant, and comes and goes randomly but the most common place it happens is in my room when it's quiet and I'm alone with my thoughts focusing on it.  Whenever I'm out and about or distracted with something in my room (reading or playing video games) I don't hear the sound at all.  Even now writing this post, I'm sitting in silence and hearing nothing but my keyboard.

Of course, Google pointed me to tinnitus, but idk if a very quick ringing sound every few hours in a quiet room fits that since to my understanding the noise from that can be loud and constant.  I can also hear about the same as I have been before discovering this (both my TV and computer have remained at 16 for the volume and I rarely use my earbuds but when I do, the volume on my phone is at default).  Nevertheless, the anxiety from this has been worse than the ringing sound.  Growing up, I had many ear infections in my left ear and have always considered it my bad ear even though I haven't had an ear infection since I was 14 (now it only aches on occasion when the weather changes).  I worry about going deaf, and worse, having this very rare tumor that has ringing in one ear as a symptom.

I'm feeling very trapped in my anxiety at the moment.  My family of course thinks I'm fine, but here I am just obsessing over random scenarios.  Along with the short, occasional ring sound, that same ear will pop when I yawn sometimes.  Has anyone had something like this before and has it cleared up or been due to something benign?  Is what I'm hearing even tinnitus in the first place, or is it something my anxiety chose to latch onto and amplify?  I'm in a weird place medical wise as well, as I'm seeing a new primary care doctor for the first time on the 18th.  Is this issue okay for me to wait until then?  I also had bloodwork done last month (old orders from my now former PCP) and all was good, if that helps anyone.

18wejoq,Anxiety,2024-01-02,Am I Experiencing Anxiety?,"A quick synopsis about me, I'm a 29 yr old with a healthy life style, and have never really experienced anxiety before, or if I have it hasn't really affected me or at least not to the point where it was noticeable enough to last this long.

Anyways for about a week now, I've been hit with this strange feeling of internal tremors and brain fog, this is the first time I've ever had tremors or felt them like this for so long. The tremors are constant, and I can feel them throughout the entire day. They seem to be at their worst when I wake up or go to bed. The brain fog comes and goes and isn't as prevalent as the tremors. It would be fine if the tremors went away but since it started around seven days ago the tremor feeling is pretty constant. The strength of the tremors have gradually gotten better however, over the past week; with the first few days having really bad vibrations/buzzing sensations. I'd say it's about 60% better than before. After a bit of research to see why it could be happening I seen sometimes anxiety can cause it. I'm not sure why it would randomly happen though as nothing major has impacted me lately and I was on vacation too which seems like the best time to relax.

I'm planning on making an appointment with a doctor soon, just to be sure, but I wanted to throw this out here too to see if it could potentially be anxiety, and how I could make it go away. 

Has anyone experienced anything like this? Or may know if it actually could be anxiety or if it sounds like it's something else.

Thanks :)

Now, a large issue is school. I will sometimes be so stressed out, I freeze-up. This is terrible as all college exams are timed. Despite understanding all the material and doing loads of practice problems, I've had a few tests I bombed. Because they are pretty much the only factor in grades, mine have been really poor. I also get distracted by my brain constantly. Like if I have a song stuck in my head, I can't focus at all on the problem. 

While they act like they care about mental health, there is nothing in place at my school to help reduce this anxiety. I would greatly benefit from taking tests in a room by myself. But doing so requires reaching out to disability resources, and they have been super unresponsive. 

Any ideas on how I can try preventing this? School is my largest stressor, and for some reason my mind has decided to ensure I never take a break from worrying. 

Thanks"

I've noticed recently that I smile a lot when I'm nervous and engaging in conversation with people, typically people I don't know well even certain coworkers. I do it involuntarily, when I notice myself doing it and try to stop I can mostly manage to do that but I still feel my face muscles straining to hold it back. Sometimes I feel like it makes people uncomfortable, others will smile back. Regardless I don't like this about myself and was wondering if anybody else can relate?"
18wdfk9,Anxiety,2024-01-02,Short sudden feeling of full body fatigue?,"I’ve been experiencing stress-related anxiety since around 2020. Symptoms usually include chest pain/tightness, shortness of breath, feeling of imminent doom, higher heart rate, and generally just being on edge. I haven’t responded well to medication for symptoms so I don’t take any.

This year, my job got more stressful and a new stress symptom started popping up: sudden short surges of full-body fatigue. I think it’s triggered in high stress situations where I suddenly (maybe subconsciously) notice the weight of my arms, head, or legs, and they’re sorta moving down in a falling fashion. So it feels almost like I’ve lost control of my body in a way, which seems to momentarily trick my brain into thinking I’m actually fatigued and about to pass out. This triggers a sudden anxiety-riddled jolt of a response, and it takes me ~30 seconds of grounding exercises to get back to normal. Usually it happens in work meetings, but it tends to happen when I’m having to listen or interact with someone for a long stretch of time and I start to dissociate a little.

Has anyone experienced this as an anxiety symptom?

My symptoms overlap a lot with heart disease, and that is unfortunately a source of stress for me. Growing up, I’ve been mostly obese. It’s not completely ridiculous for me to develop heart disease. So I never truly write these symptoms off as “just anxiety”. There’s always that bit of doubt in my head that it’s something worse.

To combat these thoughts, I have been working hard to lose weight and have a healthy diet/exercise system. I’ve lost 30lbs over the past year and have about 40 more pounds to lose this year before I’m no longer considered obese."

18wcchn,Anxiety,2024-01-02,I am struggling to Accept Anxiety as the Cause of Debilitating Symptoms - any advice?,"**TL;DR: I cannot accept that what I am feeling is a result of anxiety and I keep looking for some sort of different reason for my symptoms - any advice?**

I (24M) have been struggling with physical symptoms of anxiety for a bit now (4-5 months). I am diagnosed on the Autism spectrum and GAD.

There is quite a bit of advice that I have found to ""accept"" the anxiety and the physical symptoms and eventually they will fade. I cant seem to do that, I keep googling (I know that is bad) about other possibilities that it could be as if there has to be an explanation for why I am feeling this way. I also love to look on places like Reddit for people with the same anxiety symptoms as me and get all anxious when its not the exact same thing as me. I know its irrational but I am so sick and tired of these symptoms ruining my life.

I suffer from eye strain (a dull feeling around my eyes, makes my vision feel ""off"") face pressure (feels like sinus pressure around my nose and between my eyes and my cheeks, like I have been smiling for hours) and tension headaches. The headaches are all over my forehead but a lot of tension seems to be at my temples. There is more of a tightness feeling on the top of my head and around to the back of my head. My head also feels really heavy and when I get up from my seat or move around a lot there is this lightheaded feeling I get. These symptoms are constantly present 24/7.

I used to have hand tingling but that comes and goes. I also used to have light sensitivity but that isn't as bad as it used to be.

I have seen my GP, a neurologist, an eye doctor, an ENT, my dentist and an oral surgeon as possible reasons that this is happening and apparently I am in perfect health. I have tried SSRI's, supplements, self care, meditation and exercise. I have had a sinus endoscopy and a CT scan and they came up fine. My GP is convinced this is all anxiety but for some reason I do not trust him.

I am so sick and tired of feeling this way. Any advice for someone like me who cannot seem to accept that this is all just symptoms of stress and anxiety? Thank you!"
18wcccp,Anxiety,2024-01-02,Help please,"Hi. Im here at the doors of help. I’ve been fighting a massive anxiety disorder for a while now and it seems to be affecting my day to day life *terribly* and to be honest i cant live this way anymore. 
I hate living my life worrying to death that if something very bad will happen that would start to cause me to get a silent panic attack until i know for sure that this bad thing did not happen, its tiring me like craaaazy and I’m tired tired tired! Very tired! Its been too long and I’m losing sleep, going behind at class, socially withdrawing from society, a lot of time within my hand during the day but NO time to do anything whatsoever, constant tiring thinking, severe appetite, pointless anger disorders. I have no peace in me guys and this fight is killing me, IM TIRED! I REALLY AM! I want to live! Not just exist! I can’t move forward with my life this way! Im all alone fighting but I’m slowly losing guys, losing in a very bad way! Im trying to heal my wounds within each battle of this mental war but the next battle comes as soon as the one prior ends, making me not even start healing! Its 2024 now guys… i cant stay stuck at one timezone in my lifetime, I can’t stand still and just remain this way, I can’t think of death everyday! I cant! I can’t just cry every night and miss out on my life, i cant let down my parents! But I’m alone! In a country alone! I cant just sit cuffed from all joints that disable my mobility! Its not easy to fight this fight alone! And its even harder when you can’t even talk about it! 
At some point, I’ve realized that i need any sort of escape that can help me just walk away from this misery! I’m fighting daily! I quit drugs and all shameful actions but I can’t continue any fight without help! 
Mental health treatment is astonishingly pointlessly expensive, which makes a man wonder, “My grave wont cost as much as one session of those treatments!”
I want my life back, i want my peace back, i want my happiness back, i want my love back, i want myself back…."

So I haven't used my coffee machine in a month and a half due to traveling, buying from cafes, etc. 

So today I decided to clean it and let white vinegar sit in the reservoir, and the pot for 30-50 mins each and did this twice.  I've also run water through it several times.

So I had a scary event 12/27 and feel like I haven't been able to calm down fully since.  I think I had a panic attack or something when it happened (screaming, crying, unable to calm down) not sure if it was or wasn't.  Since then my appetite has been mega decreased/ food not appealing (history of ED) and just this feeling of anxiety pretty much constantly.  I have been taking hydroxyzine.  Is this just like residual effects of the freak out in December?

I'm 27 now and what was once in a blue moon, but now increasingly regular is I'll have nights where I can only fall half asleep. Its so hard to work out if I'm alive or dead, I get to the state of dreaming almost but my brain just can't pull the trigger.

18wb9jk,Anxiety,2024-01-02,Is subconscious anxiety actually a thing?,"Now this is going to sound like a dumbass question, but is subconscious anxiety real?

I started having anxiety/panic attacks 4 months ago, and seemingly i've made a lot of progress with it, something still doesn't sit right with me. Currently i'm experiencing physical symptoms of anxiety, such as like pressurized headache, feeling uneasy in my body, restlessness, intense bodily sensations, chills, nausea, sweating, stuff like these. I'm a very aware person of what's going on in my mind and in my body and whenever i get these symptoms i tend to overthink a lot, but before getting these symptoms and even during it, my conscious mind is completely calm and i can also calm myself down. Like there's literally nothing that my mind puts out there for me to mainly worry about, still my body is anxious and just feels so weird and unusual. Do i get these physical symptoms from something going on subconsciously that i'm not aware of? Can these symptoms manifest themselves in my body as a result of suppressing emotions or even myself? I'm very bad at expressing emotions in general, could it be because of that? Or is it just fear of another panic attack? Sorry for all the questions, but i really want to end this misery already, it truly screwed me up"
18wb38y,Anxiety,2024-01-02,Anxiety and memories,"Tw: self harm

I recently have been dealing with this weird thing where I start to get anxiety and flashbacks whenever I hear, see, touch, or feel something back to a certain difficult memory I start to get bad anxiety and flash backs. For example I recently ended up picking up the knife i first used to cut myself, but this time I was just opening a package and I got bad anxiety and the feeling of when I did it came back. Passing through my old highs school also gives me this reaction (I live in the same town). Also anything that reminds me of my first sexual experiences gives me anxiety even though o thought it was good. Really just anything that brings me back to my past, good or bad, usually draws a difficult moment for me, i get this weird anxious feeling. And I run into different triggers all the time that I wouldn’t expect to give me this feeling."

However I also wanna start working out as both a new years resolution and a lifestyle change to help combat my anxiety in ways beyond medicine and therapy. However, I'm kind of anxious about how 60mg of propranolol daily will interact with me getting more excercise when I honestly do not work out even a little bit currently.

18wavxu,Anxiety,2024-01-02,Has anyone relied on alcohol for their anxiety?,"I’m 28, I’ve pretty much drank socially since I was 21 but as my anxiety has worsened, I really rely on alcohol to reduce my anxiety. Which is obviously super unhealthy. I don’t drink every night, but if I’m especially anxious I’ll have a couple glasses of wine. if my mind is numbed just a bit, my anxiety is basically nonexistent. Not a healthy way to cope. I don’t do well with social gatherings unless there’s alcohol involved since it’ll help with my social anxiety.

Were you able to break this cycle? If so, what healthier methods did you do to relax your mind?"
18wan2l,Anxiety,2024-01-01,Anxiety Navigation and Heart Palpitations,"Hello guys,

I wanna share my story and receive some advice. On march my heart begun to have some palpitations. I'm a very anxiety person, and I have OCD.

So i did an Echocardiogram and Holter for 24 hours. The family doctor told me that it was normal but I have some extraventicular systole (or extra beats). Maybe it's due to anxiety.

But this new year's I drink coffee and alcohol and had non stop palpitions for minutes. Today when I arrived at home I was really scared for my health. I'm really worried and I'm thinking on doing the exams again. The palpitations are more than before, even when I'm not with anxiety.

I wanna change my life for the better.

Is anyone having something similar? How did you deal witht this?"

I’m wondering what direction my life needs to take? I feel this way occasionally and I’ll tell you why:
When I was a kid, I wanted to be a world-explorer, fiercely independent, and adventurous.  Then comes anxiety/panic disorder/agoraphobia and fear of being alone as a young adult and I haven’t done any of the things I dreamed of, or it feels that way. 
Suffice to say I have done other things and amazing things I wouldn’t have dreamed I would get to because of the path I’ve chosen and I worked hard to manage my anxiety and panic (and continue to do so). 
I teach full-time and am working in a career with opportunities to do all sorts of different things. I’m a volunteer firefighter/medic and I do activities I enjoy.
Despite all that, all I can do is think of myself as a failure because I am 33 and single, live with my parents (because of financial reasons and the profound fear of living alone), Don’t get out much socially and I dunno what else.
Then I go with family on trips to other places like Boston or LA and begin to think “I could live in a place like this,”;”would I be happier if I uprooted everything I’ve done to start over somewhere else” … and on it goes. There’s nothing wrong with staying where you came from and working to make it a better place. Why do I have this overwhelming voice in my brain saying I should be doing more, I should be doing this, I should be chuck all the work I’m doing and love to go somewhere else?

Four plates, four desserts, four seats, you get the idea) My two closest friends were seemingly avoiding me / weirdly excluding me the whole night and I just felt so out of place and unwelcome. 

So already feeling fucking awful we smoked weed, which of course made me fucking spiral. I left them to go home immediately after midnight, and I just sat outside freezing for 40 minutes waiting for my bus. Went home, fell asleep.

I had a panic attack in my dream (frequent occurance for me, I think it’s a side effect from venlafaxine that I’m currently on), woke up from that and have been spiraling ever since, feeling like I’m going fucking INSANE the whole fucking day, literally I walked 30 minutes in the snowstorm up to a frozen lake just standing there FOR AN HOUR IN THE FREEZING COLD CONTEMPLATING DROWNING MYSELF. FOR AN HOUR.

All because I felt like I had lost my mind completely, and my thoughts were racing through my head at fucking 2000kmh.

I eventually tired myself out, went home, slept for 4 hours and woke up just now. I finally now caught a tiny break from the fucking thoughts. 

I just feel paralyzed now. I know as soon as I get up and start doing things I’m gonna start spiraling again, and I have an exam in 2 fucking days that I am completely unable to study for.

I don’t need any tips, as I’ve tried everything in the book and it just makes me more insane thinking about anxiety relieving self-assessments.

I am very thank full I found doc who is taking me seriously now. But I am so scared for my MRI. My mom died of cancer so the last time I saw an mri machine is was her. So I have a very bad association. I also have very bad health anxiety and very bad sensory issues. My doc told me to take a Xanax before and I will. My husband is driving me.   
Like I am so scared I have a $25 giftcard to the MRI tech since I know will be a challenging patient I HATE tests.   
Anyway. I want to be put in feet first.   
I can’t wear ear plugs in my ears, they always fall out and I cant move in an mri so I can’t just fix them, thus that only allows headphones. But I cant stand the head phone that pinch your lower jaw. And I cant move so its not like I can just fix them.  
Also because of my back pain its really hard to put on/take off clothes (let alone be being sedated by Xanax) so to minimize any pain I am going to wear 100% cotton everything that way I don’t have to change into a gown.   
  
Not to mention the last time I was in a confined space I threw up.   
  
And its not like I got a lot of questions answered when I made the appt. the booker said she cant answer anything. The spine doctor said each dept operates their own way. I called the mri dept and left serval messaged and no one ever got back to me.

Been to my GP a few times and given propanalol, some talking therapy sessions etc. Is there any further stage to this on the NHS? Do they offer screenings to “diagnose” you with anxiety? Is it worth asking for a diagnosis so they take me more seriously instead of the standard prescribe beta blockers and a few therapy sessions?

Followed up at the dr, nothing came up on the ekg so they ruled it an anxiety attack, put me on lexapro and sent me home with xanax for emergencies. 

its happened again last night, except this time my heart felt like it was starting and stopping and I felt like I was suffocating and kept involuntarily jumping. 

These feel so different than how my panic attacks used to feel, I wasnt stressing myself out, my brain was empty, I wasnt even thinking about anything so it makes me wonder if it's something else going on? my cats also go nuts when this happens, pacing, yowling, laying on me the second i sit down 

Could I be stressed and not realize it? I've had some stressful stuff happen lately with losing my job and being a single mom... but I haven't really felt any more anxious than I normally am. especially since taking the lexapro, its like my brain has finally shut off. my anxiety normally presents in racing thoughts and excessive cleaning and I havent been doing any of that lately.."
18w7dzh,Anxiety,2024-01-01,Is it safe to take low dose benzo's 2-4 times per week for anxiety?,"I am a 23 year old male 6' 160 pounds with asthma, anxiety and have dealt with post concussion syndrome in the past.  
I have had diagnosed anxiety disorders (gad, ocd) my whole life but during my adult life it has been very mild and has not affected my day to day life much. However, in the past couple months it has absolutely skyrocketed to arguably the worst it has been with frequent panic attacks and severe difficulty functioning normally at all.  
I have started cognitive behavioural therapy and am gonna do blood tests to see if any deficiencies which might be contributing and am considering starting on a ssri type medication.  
In the meantime though the only thing which has been helping me feel like 'myself' at all and be able to function in social situations is when I take 0.5 of ativan or klonopin. I know these can be very addictive and must be used cautiously but at such a low dose is it safe to take a few times a week like if needed before particularly stressful social situations just to kind of keep my life and social life somewhat on track while hopefully treating the underlying issue? Or is this too much of a slipery slope?  
So far I have taken 7 pills spread out in the span of about a month since I have gotten the perscription and do not feel any symptoms of physical addiction so far."
18w7di5,Anxiety,2024-01-01,Waking up shortly after falling asleep with heart racing? ..,"I’m 27 (m) ..

I’m no stranger to sleepless nights.. I had a fear of falling asleep, relinquishing control, for years that prevented me from sleeping many a nights.. I conquered it earlier this year after a particularly bad few nights of no sleep that made me feel so bad I vowed to never ever let myself feel like that ever again.. and I’ve slept like a baby most nights since then..

This is different though.. this is seemingly out of my control.. last night I passed out shortly before midnight and was woken abruptly an hour &amp; a half later by fireworks.. jumped up.. heart racing.. realized it was fire works and settled down.. now I was awake though.. instead of going back to sleep like a good boy.. I decided to stay up and play video games and scroll TikTok.. I didn’t have work in the morning.. no big deal.. 

Now it’s 6:30 am.. I’m exhausted.. but more than willing to sleep.. I lay down and pass out for maybe 15 minutes.. only to wake up to my heart beating really fast and me feeling scared.. it settles down relatively quickly.. I’m moderately annoyed at this point.. but calm.. I just go eat a Banana and take some sleep gummies.. drink a lot of water.. 

some time passes and eventually I’m asleep again.. this time though 1 hr / 1hr 15 mins pass and I jump awake again.. heart racing like crazy.. it settles down after 5 - 10 minutes.. 

Now I’m just a little freaked out.. laying here.. feeling like dookie.. anybody else with anxiety experience this? .."

18w62gn,Anxiety,2024-01-01,Is what is happening to me normal?,"I am 20M, living in India in a small city. I am doing bachelors from here only. Please forgive me if I won't be able to describe myself properly. So, My family had a business, that's why I always had this in mind that I will do business as well, but then our family's business isn't in a very good shape. When i started bachelors, I thought that i would work on the side and learn a skill or something. I did start learning the skill, but i find myself not putting in a lot of efforts and now, I am in my last year of bachelors, and I still feel like I haven't learned it. I struggle with this thought that what should I do? Stay here in India and do masters, while helping my father in business and maybe establish another business or should i move out of India and do masters abroad and build a life there. It gets so confusing sometimes that I don't even sleep at night and I just keep overthinking about these things. Then there is social media influencing my thoughts every now and then. Sometimes making me feel like money is evil and sometimes making me feel like I want all the wealth in the world. So the skill I am learning is very unconventional therefore I don't find myself comfortable telling anyone about it because then they say that it won't work or why don't you do something safe or conventional. This is exactly the reason why I was thinking of going abroad and pursuing a decent master's degree so that i have a safety net. And, then maybe after some years when that unconventional skill is able to give me enough money, I can quit. I know these are very childish thoughts but they are the way they are. I don't even know whether leaving India would be a good option, since my family parents live here. My brother who is working in Dubai, wants to come back to India and said that he wants a peaceful life with our parents. ( In India we live with our parents forever and leaving them is not a thing here, until and unless someone is working abroad or something, it's like they say that your parents raised you and you have to become their support in their old age ). My family is upper middle class in my city and we know almost half of the city. It's hard to define Indian culture but I am trying. The reason why I think I might not want to leave India is that, the city is known to us, we are known by many here, my family is here, you can get help for everything, like here even house helps have their house helps. For example, here in India, you will see mostly the middle class have drivers, guards, cleaners, handymen, gardeners etc. and their income is only around $2000-3000 a month. But this applies to my small city not the big ones. And if i go abroad, then i won't be close to my parents or family, but maybe I'll get exposure and travel to good places. I don't get this thing, why are we all doing this, for happiness? for comfort? for money? I have so many questions. And i didn't tell you that why i want to move out of india, that is because right now my life is really very boring, and not productive at all, i am literally doing nothing good, and here also there is nothing to do because the city isn't developed. I know this is the shittiest problem you people have listened to, I don't even know what do i need to hear, i don't even know what is the question that i want to ask. But i have to say , i really felt great after writing this. "
18w60fg,Anxiety,2024-01-01,It gets better. Some tips that helped me.,"Years back I remember going through an incredibly difficult time and making a post essentially reaching out here with the subject ""Does it get better?"" or ""Does it get easier"" something along those lines. I got a couple of comments of support which really helped stabilize me back then, and thank you so much for the advice and personal stories, even though I never responded at the time.

Years later though I've answered my own question, and the answer I found is ""Yes""                                 Such a solid, unbelievably beautiful YES.

The past years I've learned to tuck away my anxiety more and more. I view it now as an ""Unhelpful passenger"" along with me, like I'm driving the car and it's always telling me to go faster or slow down. Even if it's sat there in the passenger seat, I've still learned to turn up the radio and block it out.

&amp;#x200B;

Here's a few, albeit probably common, pieces of advice which I've learned which helped me to deal with my anxiety over the years. These might of course not work for anyone, and I'm nowhere near an expert, but I look back at where I was and where I am and I can't help but feel a sense of overcoming this dang thing.

* **Trying to get out, socialize, just leave the house**. That was a big one for me. My father once put it: ""Even if you stand on the doorstep of your house, you're further than you were yesterday"" And I've found that really helps. When a friend reaches out to me now and asks me to hang out, I try and make room in my schedule, even if I don't want to go, just to push myself a lil further.
* **Breathing is a must**. Sounds silly I know, sounds absolutely typical, I know. Your heart is your enemy when it comes to anxiety, little red thing beating bump bump bump. Physically hurts sometimes in my experience, so one of the best things you can do is take a deep breath in those times.
* **Don't beat yourself up over trying.** When I'd put myself out there, I found myself cringing at the memories of how I'd try and fail to socialise, how I wasn't doing a good enough job. What's important is every time you're putting yourself out there, that's a victory against anxiety no matter what the end result of it may be. You're winning one battle at a time.
* **Channel that anxiety somewhere productive**. It's going to sound silly at first, but consider it. If your heart is gonna be racing, if your body is gonna be full of adrenaline, why not forward that energy somewhere productive? Take on some hobby of yours and hit it hard, finish some work even if it's boring as all hell. Over the past few years I took that into online entertainment, literally putting myself at the centre of attention ironically, and it's worked, it's really worked.
* **Don't be afraid to reach out.** Corny as it sounds, everyone has their issues and there'll always be someone who's there to talk to. Nobody is a perfect being and there's nothing to be ashamed of in having anxiety, it's not a switch you flicked ""On"", it's not a choice you made. Nobody should judge you for this, your close friends and family should be there for you during this, and if they aren't, there are lines you can call, people to speak to, or heck, subreddits to ask questions or vent on. You're not alone.

I wanna end this post on an anecdote related to something I went through recently.

Christmas shopping with my mother, we went into a store, it was all very sorta ""Bath/hair/beauty products"" so I was quite out of my element. Immediately a store employee began to talk to me.        He was lovely and spoke with me for a good 10 minutes, talking about everything geeky, we had a lot of shared interests, and I'd forgotten even I was speaking to a stranger. It was so friendly.

A few years ago I'd have panicked, stood in a corner, said ""Hey"" then went onto my phone to text friends, or just stood outside. That person I was when I posted to this sub the first time no longer exists, but I still remember all their pain, that's why I wanted to share my story with anxiety here.       

Anxiety is still a part of me, you can't just get rid of it, but trust me when I tell you that it gets SO much easier to deal with. All you've gotta do is give yourself time, give yourself a chance, and get yourself out there.

Good luck! You've got this."
18w5xby,Anxiety,2024-01-01,Any advice ?,"First of all I’d like  to wish you all happy new years . And I hope this new year will be better for those of you who suffer with anxiety and panic attacks . Just know you are not alone . And with a community here on Reddit i think it’s amazing  bc we get to vent and talk about our symptoms and try help each other out by giving each other advice and etc . 

Well basically idk if I’m normal or not bc even doctors can figure it out. And believe me when I say I tried going to every doctor literally heart doctor primary care doctor stomach doctor head doctor it’s just crazy to me . 

Anyways…
In June I had passed out with my eyes open my ex had to give me cpr I woke up went to the hospital fainted in the er room again within 20 minutes. They told me I had syncope  from low blood pressure . I always had anxiety for over 10 years but never this bad . So ever since than my blood pressure stays at 100/60 108/70 I don’t know why.  Thing that bothers me is I remember everything I went through the day I passed out and it causes me nervousness stress anxiousness panic because every time I get a anxiety feeling distress feeling I feel like I’m going to pass out again and I get freaked out . I get burning sensation back of neck arms and when that starts happening I know I’m going to panic I also became heat intolerant warm / hot weather  makes me feel sick and panic  . Even the heat on in the house 67 degrees makes me panic and feel faint. My body constantly stuck in fight or flight mode sweaty cold hands and feet my ears have whooshing sound I constantly feel distress wake up fatigue no motivation to do nothing can’t enjoy life I tried zoloft first pill gave me severe anxiety panic nausea faint headache I tried venlafaxine same side effect I tried ecitalopram not sure how to spell it that gave me crazy thoughts just one pill thoughts on how I was gonna die if I would get hit by car or a tornado  I tried Xanax nothing no luck I’m terrified to go through this again with another medication. I need advice opinions plz. I will be moving to Texas soon and I’m constantly in distress bc I know it’s warm there and I got no choice I gotta move there and I want to but I’m just so afraid I don’t want to pass out again or keep suffering. The psychiatrist here cost $800 for 90 minutes consultation than $300 appointments after that I’m not rich I can’t afford that . And everyday I feel sick nauseas gained either stomach pain in distress constantly worrying body aching over thinking it’s like I have no break and the heat issue is a big problem for me idk what to do anymore I tried going to doctors my family dont even care to listen to how I feel my mom not here my dad passed away so all I got left is my brother and sister and they over it and it bothers me bc they act like it’s all in my head and it’s not I suffer everyday and idk what to do anymore.

I am currently working a full-time job that very much requires me to put in my full 40 hours a week.

I am diagnoses GAD, which leads to a lot of low energy/burn out, and I also have ADHD inattentive presentation—in summary, I struggle immensely with time management, inattention and low energy.

If anyone has found a job and/or career that has allowed them financial security and a lot of “free time” despite their anxiety symptoms, then I would be very grateful to hear about it, as that seems to be the thing that I need to simply manage my (so called) life.

18w5ql6,Anxiety,2024-01-01,Rebound anxiety from occasional lorazepam use?,"So I have pretty severe chronic pain in the form of refractory migraine, and lorazepam has been the only thing in a myriad of treatments that has ever decreased my pain in emergency situations. For this reason, my neurologist prescribed me 0.5 mg lorazepam to take occasionally when I have a high pain day (about once a week). However, I’ve had some added stress in the past few months and have been taking the lorazepam a little more often, about twice a week and three times during one particularly difficult week. Since then I’ve noticed an extreme increase in my daily anxiety, with physical panic when I get up every morning, a racing heart, and nausea. Is there any chance that this is caused by the uptick in lorazepam usage frequency? If this is a rebound anxiety effect, how long might it last? Am I still okay to be using the lorazepam occasionally or is this a sign that I should not be using it at all, even for my chronic pain? Thanks!"
18w5q8k,Anxiety,2024-01-01,My anxiety/panic attacke ruined another holiday yet again. Why am I like this and does anyone else feel the same way?,"Hello All. Happy New Year.

I woke up this morning frozen in bed. Very stiff but still can barely move. I managed to pick up my phone and did A LOT of random scrolling. To the point I am not really reading any posts or articles, I'm literally just scrolling at a pace. (I realized I do this a lot before a panic attack explodes, idk why....maybe an attempt to distract myself?) At some point I put down my phone and felt more frozen in place. Limbs were stiff yet heart was beating hard and I felt out of breath. Next thing I know I started crying and hyperventilating. Eventaully, the release allows my muscles to relax and I get up........WHICH TAKES HOURS.

Today for New Year's, I woke up at 10am. I got up at 1pm. I'm so upset with myself. The whole time I felt like I was fighting an internal battle with my mind screaming GET UP DAMMIT. DAMMIT. I CANT. GET UP. AAAAHHHHH.


I'm extremely upset. I have wasted most of the day. I REALLY wanted to enjoy the holiday, find events, dine with family. But I couldn't bring myself to that picture perfect event. So this made me cry more, but for depressive reasons instead.

This isn't the first time this has happened. It's not every holiday, but most of the time. For example, this Christmas was fine, but I did notice I was slightly a bit more anxious than usual. But last year's christmas I did have a panic attack. Thanksgiving and Valentines. Heck, recently I went on my very first vacation/cruise and I ended up stuck in bed with a panic attack.


Things like these make me HATE MYSELF. I AM SO UPSET SO I'M WASTING TIME CRYING EVEN MORE. WHY AM I LIKE THIS? I'M NOT TRYING TO DESTROY HOLIDAYS I SWEAR. I REALLY WANT TO HAVE SOME FUCKING FUN AND JOIN THE FESTIVITY IN THE AIR.

Some things that I am currently pondering on: Am I unconsciously self-destructive? But fucking why? I don't think so, because a big part of me was looking forward to holidays. Or am I doing this for attention? But that makes no sense. I don't tell people I have panic attacks. They just get annoyed that I haven't come out of my room for hours and probably assumed I was sleeping in. I cry silently under the sheets. Okay, maybe not silently and I do whimper and wail but it's not like anyone came in to check on me so far. They have not noticed, and if this is for attention reasons, why would my body still react this way if there was no one enabling my behavior for all these past holidays? So it makes no sense.


I CANNOT FOR THE LIFE OF ME THINK OF A REASONING THAT MAKES SENSE. I HATE IT. I HATE MYSELF. PIECE OF SHIT OF A BODY JUST FUCKING GET UP. YOU'RE DOING THIS TO YOURSELF. YOU'RE THE ONE WHO IS RUINING THE HOLIDAY SEASON. SO WHY, WHY NOT GET UP."
18w58qc,Anxiety,2024-01-01,"Constant anxiety, I take diazepam, is it harmful? Should I switch to something else?","Hello everyone,

  
Unfortunately I have been suffering from constant inner restlessness/anxiety for several years.

Especially in the morning, why I feel there must be something weird with my cortisol levels (?)

  
I have been doing meditation for 9 years, which helped a lot at the beginning. Since the beginning of my medical transition in 2021 (male to female), however, the anxiety has become stronger, especially when I go out, but it is also simply there in the morning. I have been doing physical exercises (yoga, neurogenic tremor) for a year, which alleviate it somewhat. Short-term therapy has made it easier to go out.

  
I have also changed my diet several times (less gluten, less lactose) to see if it improves. I also stopped drinking coffee/energy drinks a year ago. I'm watching my sugar intake very carefully at the moment, as that might also help.

  
I take Ashwaghanda and ice cold showers every day, both of which help a little. Smoking CBD also helps, but it's bad for my voice (due to voice feminization), which is why I want to stop.  
Recently, however, my anxiety has been stronger and I've been taking diazepam. Even a small amount of the 10mg tablet is enough, i.e. I would estimate 1mg per day.

  
However, I'm afraid that my tolerance is now increasing and I'm becoming dependent on it.  
Does anyone have any ideas about what might be a better medication for me? An antidepressant in a low dose? Or should I stick with the low dose of diazepam? I once heard that small amounts of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors work well for some people."

So I’ve been friends with this girl for the last couple of years and she moved to Cyprus last summer from the UK for 2 years. We’ve always flirted and given eachother compliments at the gym and stuff. She came home for christmas and we saw eachother at the gym and decided to hangout outside of the gym. I always thought she was hot but I was never head over heels. 

Anyway she came round and I had such a good time. We done everything intimate apart from actually doing it. We have said we’d go for food before she goes back next weekend and we even spoke about me going to Cyprus in the next few months to visit her. 

Since last seeing her I cannot stop thinking about her. She is so perfect and her body is unreal. I genuinely think i’ve caught feels very quick but it feels right. 

But I’m just so anxious and doubt myself that she won’t want to see me again and won’t like me. Even though she’s been keen since and showed no sign of not being interested.

18w3sma,Anxiety,2024-01-01,My personal (no medication) quick relief for anxiety/depression periods.,"Backstory.  I suffer with really bad anxiety, depression and runination. It gets crippling from the end of December until late Feb like clockwork each year.

I usually bend the knee and take citalopram but the first 4 weeks are always hell on earth. This year I did not prepare for the winter so I ignored the signs and didn’t start. Lo and behold the day after Christmas I am bed bound, heart racing, sweating, feeling of impending doom keeps adrenaline pumping through my body.

I knew this would not go away without my meds but the issue is the initial side effects from my meds make me more anxious so I am in too deep to start.

What I did instead. I took ashwagandha gummies twice daily. Once first thing in the morning and the other around 4-5pm. I also drink 4-5 cups of green tea (taste like a muddy puddle) every day. When I tell you that the effects of doing this for 3 days was like day and night I mean it! It feels like I have been on my normal meds for months and feel human again. 

I also took melatonin for the first few nights to make sure I didn’t lose sleep as that just causing more anxiety.

Has anyone else tried this? Because I honestly feel the most relaxed I have in years!?"

18w39r9,Anxiety,2024-01-01,Ways to Use Self-Talk to Improve Mental Health,"How to Use Self-Talk to Improve Mental Health

Mental health is not shaped solely by the tangible forces surrounding us but also by the intangible forces that dwell within. 

The thoughts we cultivate, the conversations we hold with ourselves, and the words that echo within our minds all wield an influence far mightier than we often realise. 

As the sage Lao Tzu wisely said,
“Mastering others is strength; mastering yourself is true power.”

Self-talk is the gateway to mastering oneself, the linchpin of inner strength. Studies also suggest that self-talk has a beneficial impact on our mental well-being.

In this article, embark on a journey inward into the depths of your mind and discover how the dialogue you maintain with yourself can contribute to mental health and well-being. 

Beyond the strategies that we’ll delve into, there exists an entire universe of potential within the realm of self-talk, each technique offering the promise of self-empowerment, resilience, and personal transformation.

We will traverse the landscapes of self-compassion, positive affirmations, and gratitude practice. 

We’ll learn how to confront negative thoughts, set realistic goals, and channel our inner dialogue towards problem-solving. 

We’ll explore the delicate balance of embracing self-acceptance and prioritising self-care. 

And we will delve into the importance of seeking support, understanding that vulnerability is not a sign of weakness but a testament to our strength.

This journey is an acknowledgement of the profound interplay between the mind and our mental health. As we venture into the world of self-talk, we’ll discover that the most potent force to shape our mental well-being lies within our minds. 

It is a realm where thoughts transform into action, despair can be replaced with hope, and the battles we fight are often against our doubts and fears.

1.Practice Self-Compassion

Self-compassion is about extending the same kindness, patience, and understanding to yourself that you readily offer to friends and loved ones. 

When practising self-compassion through self-talk, think of it as an inner dialogue of comfort and support. Instead of being overly critical or judgmental when you make a mistake or face difficulties, your self-talk should sound like a reassuring friend. 

For example, if you fall short of your expectations, tell yourself, “It’s okay; everyone makes mistakes. I can learn and grow from this experience.” 

By adopting this approach, you not only ease your emotional burden but also build resilience in the face of life’s challenges.

2.Challenge Negative Thoughts

Negative thoughts can be pervasive and damaging to your mental well-being. 

To combat them effectively, use self-talk as a tool to critically examine these thoughts. 

Ask yourself whether they are rooted in reality or based on unverified assumptions. Challenge the validity of these thoughts and replace them with more balanced, constructive affirmations. 

For instance, if you catch yourself thinking, “I’m a failure,” question that thought with, “Is this thought accurate, oram I generalizing from one experience? I may have failed at this task, but that doesn’t define my overall worth. 

I can learn from this experience and do better next time.” This practice helps in maintaining a healthier and more positive self-image.

3.Cultivate Positive Affirmations

Positive affirmations are powerful, personalised statements affirming your positive qualities, beliefs, and capabilities.

They can address specific needs such as self-esteem, confidence, or emotional well-being. 

Using self-talk, you can incorporate these affirmations into your daily life. Repeatedly stating these affirmations helps rewire your brain to think more optimistically. 

For example, if you struggle with self-esteem, integrate self-talk like, “I am confident and capable. I believe in myself and my abilities.” By doing this, you gradually build a more positive self-perception.

4.Set Realistic Goals

Self-talk can play a pivotal role in setting and achieving realistic goals. Instead of striving for perfection, use self-talk to remind yourself that progress is a continuous journey. 

Encourage yourself by saying, “I’m setting achievable goals and taking one step at a time to reach them.” This self-talk emphasizes the importance of acknowledging your progress and celebrating small victories along the way. 

It’s not just about the destination but the journey and the personal growth accompanying it.

5.Manage Stress and Anxiety

Stress and anxiety can take a toll on your mental health. 

Research suggests that self-talk can be a powerful tool to regain control during stressful moments. Employ phrases like “I can handle this” or “This too shall pass” to center your thoughts and emotions. 

These affirmations remind you that you have the inner strength to cope with challenges and that difficult moments are transient. By using these positive self-talk techniques, you can maintain composure and focus even when faced with adversity.

6.Express Gratitude

The practice of gratitude through self-talk involves taking deliberate moments each day to acknowledge and appreciate the positive aspects of your life. 

This self-talk shift redirects your focus from dwelling on negativity to embracing the blessings you possess. 

By regularly recognizing and appreciating the good, you can cultivate a more content and optimistic mindset. 

For instance, you might say to yourself, “I am grateful for the love and support of my friends and family. I appreciate the opportunities that life has given me.” Expressing gratitude in this manner can significantly improve your overall sense of well-being."

It kind of feels like a bad cold but I don’t know I can function but I run out of breath very fast. 

I am worried about having and/or developing the following cconditions based on this situation; a respiratory infection, pneumonia, presence of blood in airway, collapsed lung, chest infection.

190b5hj,Anxiety,2024-01-06,Pulsating in vision?,"I have a question, and I hope it doesn't sound stupid. A couple of years ago, I noticed that when I looked really hard at a white wall, ""I was lining up posters in my apartment at the time."" I could see what looked like little vains pulsating in my vision. It wasn't all the time, only when I looked really hard at something that's solid white. I have HORRIBLE health anxiety, so I tried not to overthink too much because I do have pretty nasty sinus issues and have had since I was born, and obviously, sinuses can do a number on your eyes. So, I let it go and didn't engage back then. But, my health anxiety has gotten WAY worse recently, and I was looking at a white wall yet again at my sisters house yesterday when we were painting, so I was really focusing and I noticed it again. I had an eye examination with my regular optometrist on the 30th of December, so a little over a week ago, and her words quote were ""Alright, your eyes are young and healthy as they should be. I'll see ya next year!"" I tried not to freak myself out, but after Googling and seeing all kinds of crazy stuff, I'm kind of spirling. I've always had visual snow, floaters, black spots, etc. Like literally since I was 6 or 7, and I'm 28 now. I wear contacts/galsses due to an astigmatism, so yearly exams are non-negotiable for  me. Even with all the crazy things my eyes have always done, I've always been given a clean bill of eye health from multiple optometrists. I read that high blood pressure and diabetes could cause eye issues, so even though I'm anxious as heck, I checked my bp, which was 139/88 with a hr of 97, then it went down to 131/83 with a hr of 76 after sitting breathing about five minutes, once again, I was VERY anxious. My blood sugar, which anxiety can't affect to my knowledge, was 100, and I had eaten about 2 hours prior to that. I know that with anxiety, you're HYPER aware all the time and notice every little thing. Has anyone else ever done this?"

18wjp5o,Anxiety,2024-01-02,I don’t know if I should take this job or not due to my social anxiety,"Hey so I (25F) interviewed for a sales associate job at this clothing store a couple of weeks ago. I got a call on Friday asking if I’m still interested in the position - I think they want to offer it to me. I’m apprehensive about taking the job though since I have bad social anxiety.  I’m now worried what if I take the job and get overwhelmed or have a panic attack? The clothing store is located in a mall and it could get busy on the weekends. 

My anxiety is pretty bad and I feel like I get overwhelmed easily. I especially have bad social anxiety, usually when I socialize, my heart starts racing and I feel like I’m freaking out inside. I do really need a job though, I pretty much applied for the job out of desperation. I currently live with my parents who are extremely verbally abusive and having a job would help me earn enough money for an apartment. Plus it’s at one of my favorite stores. But I’m also wondering if maybe I should turn down the offer and look for different, non people facing jobs, like as a dishwasher?

I’m also dealing with some health issues at the moment like insomnia, high blood pressure, gastritis and high cholesterol. A part of me is wondering if maybe I should work on those first and then look for a job but I don’t know if that’s a smart decision given my home environment and the fact that the longer I put off looking for a job, the longer I will be living at home.

I have a therapist that I could talk to about this but I don’t see her until this upcoming Friday. She’s also pretty crappy and I’m currently trying to find a new therapist. I might try calling her just to see if there’s anyway she can talk to me about this before Friday but I doubt she’ll be able to see me before than."

I realized a really harmful habit in myself, and was wondering if anyone had advice on how to stop or the root cause.

I’ll be having a great time with my friends. There’s nothing to indicate or validate this way of thinking. We’ll hang out and talk for hours, they’ll invite me out, and they’re excited to see me. And yet, without fail, almost every time after we have a good moment, my brain tells me they secretly hate me. 

It’s a horrible feeling that makes me feel so sick to my stomach. It’s overwhelming and it hurts so bad in my chest. I know this is a form of anxiety and self hatred, but I don’t know how to think about when this started, or why. The feelings get so intense I either need to seek reassurance or, I dunno, cry. I always give in to seeking reassurance and trying to make the feeling go away. 

If anyone has advice, habits or personal stories they’d be willing to share I’d appreciate it. Happy new year!"
18w2mc5,Anxiety,2024-01-01,Anxiety about making a life change.. how do I cope with this?,"My freshman year of college I was doing so much and I had barely time to think or process. In the 2nd semester I experienced much more anxiety, specifically social and health anxiety and I had general drama with friends that was sooo stressful. 

Then the summer came and I was burnt out, and this carried into my sophomore year which is where I am right now. This fall semester it all hit me that I’m spending 4 years at college, away from home, on my own..and that made me panic. 

After experiencing debilitating anxiety I started medication in November and it’s helped in some ways, but it won’t solve my situation of being away from home. I also feel like I need to work on my mental health which feels much harder when I’m away from home. 

So, now I’m considering transferring to CC for a semester but I’m so scared of making the wrong choice. I don’t want to be more unhappy. There are a lot of positives to CC but I know I’m also giving up my previous life at school."

18w1dxw,Anxiety,2024-01-01,Help... im very anxious about rabies,"Sorry, i tend to be hypochondriac at times.

Just last week Wednesday, i petted stray cats at a park.The park is famous for having a community of friendly cats. All i did was just massage their fur at their head and back. All was fine until i caught myself involuntarily picking my nose shortly afterwards.

I realized, ""oh shit, this was the same hand i used to pet the cat""

And now I'm scared i might have risked myself from getting rabies since nose contains mucosal membrane

I wasn't bitten or scratched or licked on an open wound or a mucosal lining. Plus the cats i petted are not acting unusual or aggressive. None of the cats i petted are drooling or acting rabid. My cousin was also there petting them too.

But my anxiety is still affecting me. I keep asks myself this, like what if rabies virus are found on fur after the cat groomed itself?

Im planning to make an appointment with a gp doctor tomorrow so he can weigh in his professional opinion and decide the step forward, but my dad said that it would be a waste of money cause the risk is low.

I really don't know."

18w157c,Anxiety,2024-01-01,I'm so lost,"Sorry this is going to be a long post but I have been going through it for the past 6 months or so and am at a loss at this point. Back in July I was learning to weld at my job and was a bit moody and irritable nothing to severe at all but didn't like it so I decided to take some lexapro I had left over from last year.  Not long after I experienced what I thought was a panic attack, i got tingly all over and dizzy and felt like I was going to pass out. I then went to my primary care doctor and he put me on effexor which only made my anxiety worse and then within a week I was on prozac which after a little over a week landed me in the hospital. I was to the point where I was constantly feeling dizzy and couldn't be around anyone, I was breaking down crying uncontrollably and I had never felt so hopeless in my life. After getting out of the hospital I had told the new psych Dr I met that I wanted to try no meds because I was fine before all the meds and he diagnosed me bp2 and said that's why i was having such a bad reaction to the ssris. He then put me on lamictal and I was only on that 6 weeks it made me feel like a zombie and more fatigued I got up to 100 mg and before I came off had cut down to 50 mg for 2 days and he said I could just stop. I went 8 weeks without any meds and the impending doom started to lift after a few weeks, but I started getting very intrusive thoughts i had never experienced before, I was scared I was going to snap and lose it, then I was to the point that when I would get around anyone I would get tingly and feel like I was going to pass out.  I saw a trauma therapist who said this sounds like panic disorder to her and suggested I see a doctor through their company and ask for something strong acting to help with the panic attacks. I met with another doctor and this doctor told me she doesn't believe I am bipolar at all just sounds like some severe anxiety and panic with some mild depression which is expected. She then put me on prozac and told me I would get something fast acting for the anxiety,  I tried clonidine, buspar, hydroxyzine and none have helped. I have been a little over 2 weeks on the zoloft and I am not feeling any better,  I did see a new primary care doctor who gave me .25 xanax to help with the anxiety but I am very skeptical because I am in recovery and don't want to get hooked on these. I don't understand what has happened to me,  I can hardly leave my house at all for months now,  I can't stop feeling like I'm going crazy and i have never in my life been like this before. Last week after meeting with my therapist she couldn't help but wonder if this is somehow physical because I am constantly dizzy, randomly feel tingly, feel off balance all the time. So  I got a new  primary doctor and askedif we could please see if there is something physically causing all of this and I have my blood results from my old doctor back in August which showed my vitamin d is 23.6, my ferritin is 15, my b12 is 46. I'm not understanding how I was literally fine before all these meds and now I can't seem to get back to me, i am so tired and I know this isn't who I am but I don't know what to do. I miss going out with friends, I miss enjoying spending time with my partner, I am very self aware and have worked through a lot of trauma and stuff from my past but I have never in my life been like this before. Can anyone relate???"
18w1058,Anxiety,2024-01-01,"As someone with anxiety, I don't understand how I'm supposed to function in this world.","I'm constantly in one massive panic attack, to the point where I don't really remember what being calm feels like. 

Absolutely everything triggers my anxiety, but especially things having to do with the law, so driving is out of the question because I'm afraid of getting pulled over, working is off the table because messing up my taxes is illegal.

It just feels like all I'm good for is sitting around and doing a chore or two, and playing my video games. Everything that is ""normal"" for someone my age (18M) to do, like working, getting a credit card, shit like that, sends nothing but panic and fear to my brain. I've gotten to the point to where I'm not even interested in living a normal life anymore, I've panicked about everything for so long that it's broken me."
18w0o62,Anxiety,2024-01-01,Are these symptoms similar to yours? (Share your experience please),"To preface for the rules: I'm not asking for a diagnosis, nor reassurance. I'm merely trying to get an idea of what anxiety really is like at this level that doctors are saying I have, and if others have experience similar to mine.

Possible triggers: Anxiety symptoms, doctors being dismissive

I'm gonna try to keep this relatively short: I've never been an anxious person. I've been stressed, and I can have outbursts, but even my outbursts are usually maintained and never directed at anyone, but more of a venting strategy in which I get angry at the situation, and never the people.

But I've had what I considered panic attacks in the past that I went to the hospital for, because I thought they were heart attacks. The symptoms were: A 'dropping' feeling in my chest, high heart rate (140-160+), chest pressure, and waves going through my entire body. They deemed my heart was fine.

But on the 22nd, I went to the hospital because I had a non-stop fight or flight feeling in my chest for about 4 days straight at that point. They gave me some medicine. I took the medicine when I got it on the 24th, and had a bad reaction to it (hydroxyzine). I went back to the hospital and they did their treatments. Then they kept me for 3 days, where I had multiple panic attacks (similar to above symptoms. I'm explaining this because the symptoms change later) and constant anxiety feeling in my chest. They did a stress test with x rays. They found a few minor problems with my heart and changes in my ECGs, but they said it's nothing urgently serious, so I'm following up with my cardiologist in a few days. Spent 3 days in the hospital.

So that means I spent 24th-26th in the hospital. The feeling in my chest was so bad, I couldn't get up from laying down for days. Then I started feeling better, so I started getting up a bit more, playing games, and resuming my activities with some breaks to laying back down when it got bad again.

Then today, I'm feeling a bit in my chest again. I go to lay down on my back yet again. I'm doing my deep breathing to keep my heart rate and anxiety low. However, my arms and legs start tingling really bad. It kind of goes away, comes back, goes away, etc. Then my throat and neck start tingling as well. This is new to me. It's always been my limbs tingling.

Then all hell breaks loose from nowhere. To be clear: I am not anxious about anything. I'm not panicking, I'm not worried. In my mind, I'm pretty relaxed. But then my chest SINKS. IMMENSE pressure. All of my limbs immediately feel like they're being tased. They go numb, but I can still feel the tingling as well as an INTENSE vibration, like I'm holding onto one of those carnival machines that massage your hands or whatever they're supposed to do. I start having trouble breathing, my thighs lock up COMPLETELY to the point that I couldn't walk if I wanted to. I start seeing spots in my eyes like I was losing small dots of vision. My heart rate soars.

I went back to the hospital. They did an ECG and a blood test (That's all they did) and said I was fine, and it's anxiety. As I tried explaining things, the doctor just said ""yea that's anxiety"" which felt dismissive, along with other doctors having done the same.

If this is anxiety, it immediately just went to severe levels for no knowable reason in the last week, and keeps happening with worse symptoms each time. They hospital had prescribed me .25 mg of xanax until I see my primary care physician on the 10th, and cardiologist on the 4th, but I'm worried about taking it because of my extreme reaction to 50mg of hydroxyzine (which yea is likely silly, but I'm starting to feel like my body can't take much more).

Has anyone had symptoms similar to mine? Or went from never being anxious to all hell breaking loose and not stopping being anxious? I'd really like to hear some of your stories. Because of what I've read so far, this seems like some of the most extreme symptoms of anxiety, and there was no ramp-up to it. I just have these symptoms now whereas the day before, for my entire life, I was perfectly fine outside of an extremely few panic attack incidents. I mean, I literally couldn't walk and my thighs locked up for hours.

And to say it again: I'm not asking for a diagnosis, medical help, or reassurance that I'll be okay. I'm doing everything I can do to find out what's happening to me and get it taken care of. I'm just asking if other people have had similar experiences."
18w0jm2,Anxiety,2024-01-01,Do you tell people you have anxiety when they notice your behaviour?,I was diagnosed with anxiety last year but I still don't know when and if I should tell people. I particularly suffer from social anxiety. I feel like I would tell close friends but to be honest no one feels close enough to tell at the moment. Sometimes as part of my social anxiety I lose my appetite when I'm with a group of people and there's an expectation to talk during the meal or whatever. For example I went on a college trip this year and there was no one going on it that I knew beforehand. When it was time for dinner I just stayed in my room because I knew I wouldn't be able to eat and I didn't want to explain it. Someone who I had been talking to noticed and I put it off as feeling a little unwell. I just suppose I'm just wondering how do people react when you tell them and how soon you would do it.

18vzj67,Anxiety,2024-01-01,Medicating for anxiety that isn’t acute but is still impacting your life?,"I rarely get acute anxiety symptoms but I’ve realise that my avoidant behaviour is insidiously ruining my life and it’s rooted in anxiety, specifically fear of commitment, fear of failure and fear of rejection. Such situations can elicit some physical anxiety symptoms but they’re usually not too intense.

So perhaps it’s more to do with self esteem and self talk 

 I’ve been recommended anxiolytic medication as an antidote to these issues (by a non expert ) but I don’t see how they will address the core issues and change my outlook. 

Also I’m hesitant to take any medication like that because I’m worried they’ll either slow me down too much or I’ll become addicted to them or reliant on them.

I’ll talk to a doctor soon but what do you guys think?"
18vzhvg,Anxiety,2024-01-01,"Symptoms For 3 Months, Do I just Give In?","I need serious help ins someone rationalizing my thoughts and fears. This is a long read since it me venting as much as it is a genuine post so I'm sorry. I'm 28. Male. For the past 3 months, I have had some very varying levels of symptoms and if you want to see me going insane you can check my post history, along with ones that have my labs I've taken so far.

2 ER visits when the symptoms first started, and 3-4 clinic visits later and a bunch of labs that still my the GNP at my PCP's clinics and virtually have had kind of been spoonfed talks about my physical health activity-wise, and get spoken to like my months long symptoms are extreme anxiety/stress/grief induced...

EKGs, chest X-rays, blood panels, lipid panels, random UR(ine) test, hepatic panels, eGFR healthy readings... But yet

I have had: 
- Tension headaches that are more pressure than actual pain (top, sides, forehead, back of head)
- Fast heartbeat (First month)
- Cramp like pains, limb pains, joint paints (Throughout)
- Insomnia/terrible sleeping patterns due to 3-5 hours at a time
- Upper left chest pains/sometimes right
- Rib pains, sensitivity, 
- Neck/back between shoulder blades pain 
- Constipation/Nausea/Diarrhea (Varying)
- Stomach/Abdominal pains/activity
- Slight memory/mild confusion problems where my thoughts process sometimes just murks up slightly, or I cant pinpoint where my internal thoughts are going. Reading sometimes feel like I gloss too quickly over words now and misread.
- Recently the last weeks, STABBING pains that seem to be JUST under my rib line. Mostly right sided. Almost as if it's my diaphragm.
- My increased awareness of my body has resulted in me observing myself more, finding moles that weren't there years before. Or thinking there were changes in others in size or color consistency. This makes me worry about cancer.
- I AM low in Vitamin D at 10ng/ml, from one of the resulting tests
- Yellow-brown pale stools after constipation

I've been suggested/prescribed:
- 50,000K IU Vit D weekly, since a week ago (only 1 months worth)
- Was taking 5K IU daily Vit D until above prescription ^
- Magnesium Oxide (Switched to Glycinate due to diarrhea) since 2.5 months
- Culturelle Probiotics, 5Bil Count since 2.5 months


I feel like sometimes I notice a difference but then sometimes not.



I know I have health anxiety, but, this is only because of my symptoms showing up kind of suddenly back in October. These past 3 months have been hell and extremely crippling, and every attempt at a ER or clinical visit, I have been deduced it was anxiety yet I've experienced all these symptoms for some time now.

Some have changed, some of them lessen in severity, some of them have gone, some of them have come back after a month or weeks. In the end of November/mid December it seemed like I was starting to feel better but then it just went back to it.

I am mentally dismantling myself due to their persistence yet advocating for myself is so difficult. I'm so close to throwing in the towel and just... Letting it be what I suffer with and say it's just anxiety.

Googling symptoms to rationalize fucking sucks. It's led me to thinking blood clots or embolisms back in the beginning, to liver/kidney problems, and now I worry about straight up cancer especially if it has resulted in me paying attention to my body after years of barely even thinking to establish a medical professional safety net.

 But yet it feels like the symptoms sticking around for so long deserves my attention when it's been THREE months, but yet the Internet is so double sided because I see people say it can be extreme anxiety or stress- OR -a serious condition or outright cancer.

It's a vicious circle and I've never had a period of time as long as this one where I had a mystery ailment. Maybe a week or two or so maybe one time every one year or so for the past 5ish years but yet never like this and it begs the question if this is progression of something serious rather than ""just anxiety"". But all the big bad things that I COULD have lie under the murky waters of my PCP clinic taking their time and believing it is anxiety/stress. I haven't talked about my newfound mole, or changes in existing ones yet, but that was because I have an appointment tomorrow amongst a handful Ive already had between actually noticing them.

I need help, and at least in part of anyone can tell me opinions or any sort of similarities between anyone and I. I'm at the end of my rope, honestly, because trying to go to professionals only gets me. 

Do I advocate for myself harder?
Do I give into the ""you have high anxiety""?
I lost my mother 2 year ago and now since it's on record they won't stop bringing it up, either when it comes to stress and anxiety.

 But my symptoms persist to a degree that I just... Can't ignore when the waiting isn't doing anything to remedy my issues."

18vz9ko,Anxiety,2024-01-01,Switching from xanax to klonopin,"I was previously on 1.5- 2 mg a day of Xanax for anxiety. My dosage was 1mg XR in the morning and 0.5 mg XR at night. I also have the regular 0.25 mg I can take 3 a day. I never take 3, usually just one or 2 of those if I have to go in a store or something. Terrible agoraphobia. 
Anyway my new doctor asked if I’d like to switch to klonopin because the Xanax aren’t helping anymore as I’ve gained a tolerance and I just don’t want to up my dose. 
He prescribed me 0.5 of the klonopin up the 3 times a day. So yesterday I was reading that they are equal to Xanax and it scared me that if I didn’t take all three pills I might have withdrawal. So I felt okay and no panic after the first pill. About 8 hours later I started to worry about withdrawal and took the second. It knocked me on my butt and made me feel high.. 

I guess I’m asking any advice from others who have switched did you keep them same dose? 
He also still prescribes me the regular Xanax 0.25 but I really don’t want to take those. I’d rather just be done with Xanax all together. 

Edited to add I have been on different doses of Xanax for over 10 years. This being the lower end and I’ve been at 1.5-2 mg a day for at least two years. Also I’m aware of the addiction, memory loss, and all of that."

I’ve just started taking propranolol for panic attacks (on day two) and I’ve noticed I’ve been having some (minor) diarrhoea. I know this could be caused by the medication, but does it ease off?
Apart from that, I’ve not noticed any other side effects thankfully. I’m also not 100% the meds are causing it, I do get anxious tummy issues, but in case it is, it would be great to hear other people’s experience.

Tomorrow is my first day back at work and I will be taking it before I go as I get severe anxiety anywhere outside of my house (I suffer from agoraphobia). 

Oh and I’m only taking 10mg as and when needed.

I knew 3 people die of cancer this year so I have been fucking terrified of cancer and every little thing I feel is off, my IMMEDIATE thought is “cancer”.

I’m 31 years old male. This year I’ve had like 5 blood tests done for hepatic function, metabolic, urinalysis, colonoscopy and endoscopy, like 4 ultrasounds. All have been fine. 

I thought I had lymphoma and it turned out to be a benign lymph node. Thought i had a clot and it turned out to be a non vascular cyst. Colonoscopy and endoscopy was all fine minus a minor hemorrhoid. All my blood tests came back fine.

Thought I had prostate or bladder issues. Went to my urologist and was told I’m fine and said I had the best urine he’s seen all day and he LITERALLY told me to stop worrying and go drink a glass of wine 😑😑. I told him my primary care ordered a prostate blood test and was like “what the fuck?? Why would she order that?? That’s so stupid. At your age??”

I went to my primary care so much that I’d be like “hi Doctor *name*!! I’m back again! 😅” and she told me that she ordered it to give me some peace of mind. 

Thought I might have lung cancer and did a chest x ray and everything was fine. 

Now I’m feeling something in my stomach again and I’m like “oh no it’s liver cancer or something.

I’m just so so fucking tired. Feel like this year has been wasted because this anxiety has kept me in a state of depression and frozen in time.

I can’t even enjoy the food that I used to enjoy because healthy eating. I feel guilty when I sip half a glass or juice because “sugar” and diabetes becuase HbA1C was highest it’s been this past year at 5.3. Still below even prediabetes level but I got spooked.

I’m just unhappy.

I want to stop worrying but my fear is that as SOON as I stop worrying then something bad will happen under my radar. "

190agpv,Anxiety,2024-01-06,Here to help,"Currently in bed after university, wrecked! 

This year I begun studying holistic counselling &amp; psychotherapy, it’s been a dream. 

You see, for the last 5 years I have been dealing with generalised anxiety disorder, panic disorder and undiagnosed depression. 

I suffered beyond comprehension, words will never do justice. 

I used to scroll through this forum, looking for the answers every minute of my waking hell that was life. 

I searched high &amp; low for the answers, and all I was left with was further hopelessness, and ultimately the only thing that seemed in my control was when I chose to leave this world. 

One day arose where something changed. I had an urge to fight back. I said to myself I’m already in hell, let’s see how much I live despite this all, and whilst doing this let’s see if I can get my life back to some degree. 

I stopped looking externally, and dove into the last place I thought: Myself. 

It all changed when I looked within, everything changed. 

Fast forward to today, 0 panic attacks, anxiety is up and down, but I am here &amp; I have a purpose. Losing mum two years ago wasn’t easy but I added it to the fire that fuels me everyday. 

You see you can either be a victim or a victor. 

This is life, it’s beautiful, it’s horrifying, but it’s all perception. I had a sad beginning, but that is not the end. In fact I’m not even a quarter of the way through the book!!

I am also depressed and unwell myself, so that makes it stronger, and she is also worried about me. But I cannot stop thinking terrible things about her and feel bad about that. She was often sick and unwell mentally when I was a child and emotionally abusive, shouted a lot, exploded, was aggressive and abusive towards my father, so I guess that plays into how I see her. And of course that triggered me having mental issues as an adult, and she knows that, and we just developed this horrible dynamic, to be honest I cannot stand her, although she tries and wants me to be better. Just her whole presence is so heavy, the way she speaks, how she coughs, just very unpleasant.

Sometimes, Luna's mind played tricks on her, filling her thoughts with self-doubt. But she discovered that these thoughts were not her reality. With a courageous spirit, she learned to let them go, setting herself free from their grasp.

Luna realized that comparing herself to others only dimmed her light. She was unique, special, and rare. Each person she encountered had their own journey, their own dreams. So instead of comparing, Luna celebrated her individuality and embraced the differences that made her shine.

In the company of others, Luna remained true to herself. She understood that no one could truly know the depths of her thoughts and emotions. So she chose to be authentic, allowing her genuine self to radiate like a guiding star. And in doing so, she discovered happiness and freedom, living her life with zeal.

Luna recognized that her thoughts were within her control. She could release the ones that caused distress and hold onto those that brought peace. With the power of her mind, she became the master of her own thoughts, bidding farewell to anxiety.

With every realization, Luna's confidence grew. She knew, without a doubt, that she was more than enough. She not only survived, but thrived and soared to unimaginable heights. Her light became a beacon of hope for others, inspiring them to believe in their own worth.

""Yes,"" Luna declared, her voice resonating across the universe. ""I am enough and more!"" Her spirit ignited with passion, fueling her determination. She embraced her true self, a radiant star bursting with sunshine, joy, and peace. And as she released her worries, her heart danced with a melody of contentment.

So, my friend, remember Luna's tale. You too are enough, worthy, strong, and tough. No challenge is insurmountable, no dream too far. Believe in yourself, let your light shine, and make your heart sing. For within you lies a brilliance that can illuminate the world."

I used to do swimming and no more. When I start doing sports, I feel nauseous, as if I were suffering of a  anxiety attack.

The same goes to laughing or even triying to FAP!

18vw7c0,Anxiety,2024-01-01,Benefits of Laughter,"Laughter has various health benefits. Physiologically, it triggers the release of endorphins, the body's natural feel-good chemicals, promoting an overall sense of well-being. It also reduces stress hormones, such as cortisol, which can contribute to anxiety and other negative health effects.

Psychologically, laughter can improve mood, increase resilience to stress, and enhance social bonds. It fosters a positive mindset, helping to shift perspectives and cope with challenges. Additionally, laughing often involves deep breaths, promoting better respiratory function and increasing oxygen flow.

Socially, laughter is a universal language that strengthens connections between individuals. Shared laughter fosters a sense of camaraderie and can improve communication. Moreover, the act of laughing together promotes a positive and enjoyable atmosphere, contributing to overall mental and emotional health.

In summary, laughter is a multifaceted activity that positively impacts physical, psychological, and social aspects of health, making it a valuable and enjoyable component of a healthy lifestyle."

I used to diagnosed with GAD (general anxiety disorder) in the past and had been in talk therapy for 3 years. It gave me huge insights about myself and after finishing i made exposures myself and had some relief.
But i wanted to give EMDR a try for quick relief maybe because exposure myself is effective but not easy and i also need a guidance from someone else.
It has been 6 months in EMDR but i cannot see any difference in my daily life yet.
Seems that some traumas are resolving in therapy room but i cant really feel the difference.. moreover it makes me feel worse because i stopped exposing myself since im trying something new and try to believe this method.

I suffer from hypochondria and my biggest fear is a bleeding that never stops. My extraction site hasn’t bled (actively) since the extraction (which happened 72 hours ago) but I am still scared of dislodging the clot and initiating incessant bleeding. It feels like there’s a knife dangling over my head and I just feel so suffocated all the time knowing I have to care after this tooth for 3-4 more days or more!

It’s taken a toll on my body and perpetuated my poor mental health. It affects the way I socialize and interact with others as well as my dream to pursue music. I’ve pretty much thrown that out of the window since it is virtually impossible to improve my vocal skills with a fucked up throat.

18vv2ul,Anxiety,2024-01-01,Some advice about hypochondria?,"I made an account only to write this. There's a chance that I'm making this worse by making this post but health anxiety stops me from enjoying anything and I need to put it out somehwere.

I am a very anxious person overall, if something exists than it probably stresses me out. But being stressed out about my health is absolutely the worst. 

I've had a few episodes with hypochondria in my life. I am turning 23 this year. When I was very young I would often watch some programs about diseases and then I wouldn't be able to sleep at night because of them. 

It got calmer until about two years ago I noticed a weird mole on my skin and I was terrified that it could be melanoma. I went to doctor and he told me that it's nothing serios and it's just a mark, but for some reason I couldn't believe him and I contacted another doctor. He confirmed what the previous one said. He also sort of ridicouled me for thinking  that it was melanoma, but in a comforting way and that really helped me. 

It was calm for two years until in September I drank a little bit too much caffeine for one day and my heart was racing. I googled it and of course I found something about it potentially being a heart attack. Since then I have been living in fear. 

Cardiologist told me that I can't really have heart attack but I'm worried about something else right now. About a month and a half ago I noticed a that I have noticed headache. Not sharp or severe one, it wasn't bothering me initially, and It doesn't hurt all the time (mostly when I think about it) but few days ago I thought to myself ""what if it's some sort of cancer?"" I went to doctor to check this, and I think I didn't describe it well enough, however she ordered me to do blood tests. I did and everything was in norm except for one test and I am now freaked out because of it. Couldn't deliver the results of the tests yet because the clinic is closed until tomorrow.

I know that many people struggle with hypochondria but the thought of being this one unlucky person who really has a disease stresses me out so much. I know everybody goes one day but I don't want to do it yet. I am constantly searching for comfort and I talk to everyone about this and I think that they are getting annoyed with it. This pain could even be caused by me hitting myself on the head and not remembering about it (because that's how it feels btw.) but I can't help thinking how is it to be dead and how my family would react to me being sick. 

In hindsight I am thinking that maybe I shouldn't have went to doctor this time around and sooner or later this would disappear. Now I am even afraid to even eat anything that isn't fruit, vegetable or bran and to drink anything that isn't water or juice.

Some distractions like music, working out or being around people work but at times it isn't enough. 

If anyone had a similar experience I would appreciate if you shared it with me. I am sorry for this post being so long."

It was like having your senses turned up to level 100 where you're just overstimulated by every single sound or change in environment, simultaneously having a million thoughts race across your head at once, coupled with the extreme fear of impending doom. 

It felt like I was going absolutely crazy and off the rails. I had to actively control and calm myself down otherwise I would've been in a state of delirium. It went on for close to an hour in waves, though it felt like an eternity. Any advice is appreciated 🙏"

18vu4ab,Anxiety,2024-01-01,Health anxiety triggered by post-viral complications,"Hi everyone,

Before I start, I've read the community rules, and understand that frequent reassurance posts are not allowed, however this is my first and only post here, as I don't know where else to post and who to talk to.

I'm a 27 year old male and I recently had Mono (glandular fever), and for the last 2-3 months or so I've been dealing with post-viral fatigue (unable to exercise like I used to, random breathlessness, tired all the time, general fatigue) and it has unusually affected my mental health (I've been told that Mono/other viruses can cause this). I used to be fairly physically active before all of this (gym 3-5 times a week, going on frequent walks, etc. and used to train Muay Thai and other martial arts before that for years). I should also mention that although I've vaped here and there, I am not a smoker, and don't really drink at all.

Ever since my symptoms I'd spend big chunks of time on Google/Reddit reading about anything and everything related further (although very low chance) complications such as Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, etc. and got myself worried. I ended up in hospital ER twice a few weeks back due to the fatigue and breathing issues, thinking I was dying, and have also seen a heart specialist. All test results have shown that my heart is 100% healthy, and lungs look fine, and have been told that I just need to rest and let the fatigue pass.

Today it is the 1st of January, and honestly when I woke up, I kind of started feeling anxious again as it is a new year, and it made me think of the fact that I'm aging (creeping up to 30), as well as potential future health complications.

I started reading about people with thicker waists being at higher risks for heart related issues, and read multiple places that if your waist is 40+ inches, you're high risk. So I measured my waist and it was just over 40 inches, and that obviously worried the hell out of me.

Some context; although I have a thick waist (due to my previous gym diet of eating high calorie numbers for weight/muscle gain) I do feel like I am generally fit elsewhere, i.e. arms, chest, legs, having more muscle mass/looking more fit, etc. And also, I was about 103kg (at 6ft height) a few months ago, and am now down to 97, so cutting the weight down somewhat fast.

Anyway, I guess what I'm looking for here are maybe some comforting words, because as silly as it sounds, I'm now stuck in an OCD loop of thinking because my waist is about 40 inches, there is no hope for me at this stage, and I'm bound for health complications, namely strokes etc. as I've made the mistake of reading some horror stories online. And because I'm dealing with post-viral complications, I can't really exercise right now, other than light walks, to help cut down the weight. :(

Any help/advice will be appreciated more than you'd know. &lt;3

P.S. Very sorry for the poorly structured post, my brain isn't really working at the moment.

Edit: I should also mention that I am currently in therapy, however I've only had about 3-4 sessions, mostly online, and I feel like I haven't really started to get anything too effective out of it as of yet. I understand that it takes time and patience."

Next day decided to quit nicotine forever and i can say im very very proud to be 3 months nicotine free .
I felt very out of this world and had crazy mental health issues because of the addiction and quitting it .
Now im somewhat stable but , life changed , i feel different , people around me feel different and when i refuse to think about stuff too much to not tigger a panick attack even though in the past it was never a problem.

18w28vi,Anxiety,2024-01-01,How can you ease an anxiety flare up after being anxiety free for so long?,"i managed to get my anxiety under wraps months ago and my mental health has never been better, i’m happy. however, there were some events last night that seem to have triggered my anxiety to come back.

being new years eve i reflected on my year and it made me think of my ex and the times we had together. it made me sad, which was weird because i’ve been over him for about 4 months now and want nothing to do with him, but the memories really got to me. the night got worse as a family member was attacked by our “family friend” (for no reason) and was given a broken nose, broken eye socket and is unrecognisable. it’s hard to see and not get upset. 

those things understandably made me anxious and upset but it was a shock to feel that way regarding the first thing, as i haven’t cared in so long. of course the second thing is distressing regardless. but, i’ve noticed that things are bothering me again that usually wouldn’t. i had to share my bed last night which i usually don’t care about especially when it’s someone i know and am always close with, but i woke up feeling unclean (the person is perfectly hygienic), every little stupid thing is setting me off today and it’s worrying me. i have taught myself a lot since my breakup and my anxiety had pretty much vanished, i hope today is a one off and it doesn’t come back :( "

I was  Me I was myself I realized I meant to help probably wasn't the best butI was dealing with it really well Despite not having that much support .  This breakdown was caused by my mom just saying wrong thing"" How come you can't do this you're in what grade I can't believe you"" That is what I got when I asked for help on my  Math homework.It sounds stupid but it's seriously sent me into a downward spiral andMade me realize I didn't know what times tables and I was starting high school how was I ever going to make it in the real world.I couldn't sleep I couldn't go to school this was online and in school since it was 2020 And the 1st day I went into school I went to my math class I only got a problem in and I went to my next class and I had a mental breakdown and had to go home. I was that scared And it seriously f***** u* my life and I couldn't go back into school unless I was in one room Or else I would have a panic attack.I remember I would literally ask my Google Assistant how many days I had leftBecause it felt like I was going to fail and I was going to become home this when those days We're up. The next breakdown I had last year in February Basically I thought I was a horrible person and other people knew that  And I basically went on a apology  Ram page. If I remembered anything that was even slightly bad I would apologize to people it didn't matter how old it was I needed that forgiveness and if I didn't get it I would throw up. This led to me having anxiety so bad that I would throw up because I  Genuinely believed that people were going to find out how bad a s***** person I was and hurt me or publicly reject me. It was just not a good year And it took me this full year to recover from it And I was just sitting in class today  Spiraling again. I've been living under the mentality of make the most out of these years because these are probably the most fun you're ever going to have because you're not good enough for anything else.

The  jealousy was about th4em being better than they were but now that I have processed my feelings I think it's mostly about feeling like I have to do all these fun things before I leave high school. I Turned 16 last year and I completely Didn't want to get my  Permit. I believed I was so stupid that I was going to hurt someone on the road and I just didn't really see a point in getting my Driver's license. Now I feel like I'm being left behind. All my friends are doing all these cool things and driving places Growing up And I feel like I'm just going to be stuck forever. I basically went to high school just to set my mind to have as much fun as you can because come see you're here you're not gonna know what to do with yourself. So I think that's why I couldn't hear you being Jealous of people. If they did something good that means they have a better opportunity than me, they're more hard-working than I am, and they have a better chance at a good  Future. If someone's really passionate about art I wish I was that passionate so maybe I could earn  Money and do what I love At the same time. That's the root of my jealousy. All these kids have these opportunities that they deserve and I don't have any opportunities because I don't deserve one. I think that's why I feel so down But it feels good to figure it out. What do I do now though? How do I deal with these feelings cause they're not just gonna go away."

18vtavc,Anxiety,2024-01-01,Why did I used to complain a lot when I was a kid?,"Hey guys, Happy New Years 2024! I wanna talk about a thing but I don’t want you guys to think I was a terrible human but I kinda complained a lot during my childhood especially when I was  in High School. I remember it was usually about the teachers I had in school. I made a post about teachers so if you wanna check, go ahead and tap the link. Things happed a lot during my 2nd semester of 10th grade. I kinda remember the reason why it became such a hellish loop is because I used to go to a go to a cram school to study from end of  8th grade because I had a entrance exam for High School so I joined there, pass the exam for my High School and it was the time for my first summer break in High School. We had snacks we are able to eat in my cram school as a reward for studying hard and being focused but that day, there wasn’t so many kids so me and the young staff were talking that soo many snacks are still left and I made a joke I could eat all because it could be a waste if you throw it to the garbage can and the young staff overreacted my joke and started to say something weird and I wasn’t able to say back because it was a young lady and I respected ladies more than men’s and didn’t want to hurt her feelings so I just kept still but my 2nd Semester just became a living hell. The teachers bossed me around like ***, I met lots of crazy people in the train of in the bus and lots more but I had quite a bad time that time. It was painful, depressing, and sometimes I thought I wanted to just give up. Luckily, I was able to finish the 2nd semester but it was extremely stressful so I became extremely frustrated and complained a lot. I didn’t complain on purpose but it came out during having a conversation with someone. I was like extremely anxious during my holiday from school for the whole time like counting down the days I start school again and meet the teachers there again and listening their insults. I think the other reason is that the holiday was short so I really didn’t liked it but I think my fear of teachers was probably extreme because I complained a lot about them. I don’t know but I think low self esteem, lack of confidence, or depression connects to extreme complaining."
190dgcd,Anxiety,2024-01-06,How More Couples/Women That Keep Choosing To Be Childfree Could Cause Humanity And Society To No Longer Exist Is A Bad Thing,"How will the existence of humanity, the existence of public establishments and the existence of parenthood be able to survive if more couples/women keep choosing not to procreate.  
The effects of more couples/women that keep choosing not to procreate could cause the existence of humanity, the existence of public establishments and the existence of parenthood to be at a risk of no longer existing anymore.  
The existence of humanity, the existence of public establishments and the existence of parenthood are all very important things for the future because  
1. Humans (including women) were created to reproduce in order to keep the human race existing for many years to come.  
2. Humans have gotten the chance and ability to create and invent so many unique and useful things ever since the human race began.  
3. Public establishments were meant to allow humans to have access to them and were only meant to be operating in an environment where humans are around.  
4. Parenthood was meant to be seen and created as something that is beautiful, delightful, rewarding, important, fulfilling and meaningful for a married couple to choose to experience.  
Since the existence of public establishments are included, Here are different types of public establishments that could be affected which are  
1. How places of business (like jobs, companies, corporations, and manufacturers) could be at a risk of no longer existing anymore if the amount of new people that choose to apply for jobs at businesses, companies, corporations and manufacturers and the amount of new people that buy items from manufacturers keeps decreasing because of more couples/women choosing not to procreate.  
2. How places of education (like schools, universities/colleges and tutoring services) could be at a risk of no longer existing anymore if the amount of new people that choose to apply for jobs as teachers/professors by teaching new students at schools and universities/colleges, the amount of new students that choose to go to universities/colleges and the amount of new children that need to go to schools and tutoring services to get an education keeps decreasing because of more couples/women choosing not to procreate.  
3.

18vqr28,Anxiety,2024-01-01,HELP! I think I'm going to have a heart attack,"I'm (20M) I discovered I had depression at 14, I started seeing psychologists but I never took any medication, at 16 the panic attacks started, I started taking several medications for anxiety, depression, and anti-psychotics such as fluvoxamine, escitalopram and quetiapine. I took it until I was 18 and stopped because I felt like a zombie, I couldn't do anything ''cool'' with my life while taking the medication, I stopped therapy and stopped going to the doctors and started focusing on myself. \]

It's been resolving for 2 years, but now, out of nowhere the panic attacks started, I've been having chest pain for about 2 weeks, almost eternal, but they gradually get worse at night, shortness of breath, I feel like ''pins and needles'' in my chest . Earlier today, New Year's Eve, I started to get dizzy and lose my balance, I don't have any heart problems other than the arrhythmia, I monitor it every year and my doctor says that anxiety is always to blame.

I'm doing everything, what I've always done without medication, and nothing is helping, I stopped drinking and using drugs 1 year ago, I eat well, I do heart exercises every day, I had regular sleep until this started, I try occupy my mind so as not to cause any type of anxiety, but none of that seems to work. I feel like I'm going to die at any moment from a heart attack or heart failure, die in my sleep, or have a painful death. I haven't been able to sleep well for days, and today, coincidentally, I can't even sleep. I don't know what to do to improve this, I would go back to taking my medication in peace but where I live it's a holiday and there's no way to make appointments because of the ''New Year''.

About a year ago I smoked (I use to be a routine weed smoker) and had a panic attack. I experienced something like Alice in wonderland syndrome. Then I also had a feeling like I was being pulled out of this world. It honestly scared me and I haven’t smoked since. Before and now I experienced a setting feeling in my body. Then all of a sudden a heavy weight came over me and I could feel myself having an anxiety attack. But tonight I had that weird wrong feeling. I was about to go to bed, I literally just ate a few grapes and kissed my husband goodnight when the feeling happened. I didn’t smoke anything, I don’t even drink really. So I was totally sober. I just hate this feeling. It makes me think if I keep having this feeling I’m going to be pulled from this reality. That I can only have this feeling so many times before I go away.

then there's the anxiety about having to sit through a 6 hour class. i have anxiety when i get hungry bc of trauma and it can to the point of a panic attack, and i also get anxious if i can't use the bathroom because i feel trapped. i know it sounds crazy but it can be really debilitating. if i pass out or something from hunger it might mess up the class and then i might not get my certificate of completion. idk. im packing food and stuff but i just don't know how much freedom ill have to come and go and it makes me rly nervous. add onto all of that that im a recovering agoraphobe and being outside of my house at all makes me feel unsafe. it's rly just not a fun time.

i know that in reality, ive been able to handle similar things before and i should be able to do it again, but im so afraid of HAVING anxiety that it's GIVING me anxiety. that seems to be what's making me the most anxious rn. breathing exercises don't really seem to work that well for me, so i don't know what to do to calm down. what can i do to be less afraid of having anxiety? i have SUCH a hard time coping with pressure because im terrified that ill have an anxiety attack and mess everything up."

Long story short, always been anxious, never had a panic attack or anything like it before june of last year. Since then, it's a constant battle with everything I feel from the arm, the neck or the chest. It's slowly making me go crazy. I know I won't have a heart attack. It's normal to feel your heart. It's normal to feel it go faster when you move, digest your dinner etc etc, but man, my brain doesn't give a single F about this. 

''I feel something'' Must be a problem. Oh! He doesn't react, let's make it harder to resist and then BAM! I feel a little pain in my arm or my neck or a little chest pain. My cardiologist told me that everything was alright and I know that my problem is more and more deep in my mind, but it seems that after 7 months even with a therapy to help me controls my emotions, it doesn't work.

18zkwq7,Anxiety,2024-01-05,Healthy anxiety,"Hi, please help me Reddit strangers.

I will preface this by saying I had a year of intense therapy to deal with everything I’ll blurt out below but that was about 4 years ago now. 

Basically, I am mid 30s. I have had over 50 surgeries and procedures because of my Crohn’s and now have a permanent ileostomy. I have a wonderful husband and the sweetest 4YO son. 

My health anxiety is just at an all time high. I am terrified of something happening to my son or my husband - specifically bowel cancers in my husband and just anything I read about children and unexpected death for my son.

I’m terrified I’m going to die early or that I have cancer. I’m scheduled an MRI and have had some blood work done because my Crohn’s is pretty rough right now (vomiting, pain) and I’m just terrified.

I don’t want to live like this but I don’t know how to shake it. I’m just so scared - usually at night - I have no idea what to do next. I can’t afford my old therapist again. I know I have taken all the steps to sort out my current health issues and just have to wait. I am on anti medication but because of my high output stoma I am wondering if I’m having issues absorbing the full dose which may be impacting me.

Any suggestions would be well received! I’ve never posted on anything like this before so I feel a bit ‘laid bare’ as I think in real life no one would expect this of me!"

18yggsy,Anxiety,2024-01-04,Concerned about my health,"So back in August 2022 I developed agoraphobia and stopped leaving the house. That led to me not being very active and pretty much just sitting around all the time. 

I gained about 30 pounds from November 2022 - April 2023. I’m very concerned about this weight gain. I wouldn’t have really considered myself to be very active before I got agoraphobia, I may have gone out more meaning I was getting some steps in but I never really worked out. I held steady at the same weight for 2 almost 3 years. So gaining 30 pounds in such a short amount of time seems really odd. I wasn’t eating any different than I normally do to be honest. I wasn’t eating good, I would eat out and all that. But that’s kind of always how I’ve always been. Not only did I gain all that weight I have purple stretch marks around my belly button area and a little further down. Those are also concerning me. 

I’ve changed my diet and eat so much better now. Less carbs and sugar, no eating out. I don’t eat pasta, bread, or rice (too high in carbs). I haven’t lost a single pound. I had some lab work back in August and everything came back normal but I’m concerned I might have something hormonal going on. My mom has hypothyroidism and hormonal issues runs in family, every woman in my family has a hormonal issue. My doctor said it was stupid to check a 19 year olds hormones because I’m “too young”. My mom had to have surgery for endometriosis at 19… so I’m definitely not too young. 

I just don’t know what to do. I haven’t felt like myself at all either. I don’t feel my emotions like I used to. I just feel off. I wish my doctor would take me seriously because I just feel like something is not right. Also all this extra weight is making me feel disgusting. I genuinely hate myself which doesn’t help with the agoraphobia. I already didn’t like the weight I was at and this extra weight is killing me."

I genuinely feel like my brain has broken. The ruminating thoughts never stop, I’m always scared. Everything feels unreal / strange. I cannot connect with anything or be present, my mind just spins all the time. I can’t focus or be present. I’m exhausted all the time.

I was diagnosed with complex ptsd but don’t know how to heal. I’ve lost all my emotions and feelings. Therapy will help temporarily but these thoughts never stop. The feeling strange and like I want to jump out of my skin never stops. The fear of being unsafe never stops.  

I’ve become severely numb to the point where just getting through the day feels impossible, but somehow I grit my teeth through it. I never even knew feeling like this was humanly possible. I was on Lexapro for a year and it wasn’t helping, now I’ve been on Zoloft almost 2 months, it’s helped turn down some of the intrusive thoughts but they still torture me daily. I also get hopeless thoughts about how living life where you can’t feel is pointless, and it’s pointless to feel like your mind is at war with reality every single day. I had a happy and great life before this, this last year has been such hell mentally. I just want myself back, it feels like my brain is fried and doesn’t work like everyone else’s.

 Why can't I never stay on track even when I slept hella early the night before? Why are all the students carbon copies of each other and have a lame attitude towards some people? Why do all the sport kids have an attitude, they act like they're better than every other bitch at school? Why are there fights every 3 days?

I get paid well, like my coworkers and boss, etc. It's a small family business so it's nice even though I've only been there since October.

I'm an alarm handler (for alarm systems, NOT 911), which sounds stressful but it's actually the most chill job I've had. But today I came into work and was told I handled a fire alarm incorrectly. He'd printed out the records of the alarm where I'd called dispatch, received a restoration, and told dispatch so the fire department wasn't actually sent out. He just told me to dispatch anyways in the future and not tell the operator that the alarm restored (with the idea that the alarm panel could've been affected by a fire, though this particular one was a frequent false signal known to the site and other operators).

18w5h1o,Anxiety,2024-01-01,A Surprising Turn of Events: Overcoming Fear in an Unexpected Solo Adventure in San Francisco,"During Christmas 2022, I found myself on a solo adventure in San Francisco, marking my second visit to the U.S. but my first solo journey. As someone grappling with Generalized Anxiety Disorder and hypochondria, I've always been unnerved by sudden increases in heart rate and blood pressure.

On a whim, I decided to experiment with weed, choosing a strain with low THC and high CBD, hoping it would ease my anxiety. Unfortunately, the experience went south. While in a cab back to my hotel, the effects of the joint hit me – my heart raced, breathing became difficult, and I felt trapped in my mind. The language barrier with the Chinese cab driver compounded my panic, as I couldn't convey my urgent need to get to a hospital. Stepping out of the cab, I frantically sought help from passersby. A woman, seemingly overseeing a porta-potty, came to my aid, trying to reassure me that it was just a panic attack, not a heart attack as I feared.

The situation escalated to the point where paramedics were called, despite the woman's concerns about the potential cost for what she believed was just a bad reaction. Dehydrated and anxious, I was prohibited from drinking water due to some protocol until I reached the hospital. In the ambulance, the paramedics reassured me it wasn't a heart attack, frequently checking if hospitalization was necessary.

Curiously, I started monitoring my heart rate and blood pressure, observing their fluctuations. Engaging in a mental game to control my heart rate, I unexpectedly confronted a long-held fear. For years, I had avoided any medical checks of my heart rate or blood pressure due to a past traumatic episode. This harrowing experience, albeit dramatic, surprisingly helped me overcome this fear.

Ultimately, I insisted on going to the hospital, which resulted in a bill of $1,000 to $2,000. Reflecting on the ordeal, I'm grateful to the strangers who didn't judge a panicking foreigner and to the paramedics and the woman who earnestly tried to save me from unnecessary expenses. This bizarre, anxiety-filled episode turned out to have a silver lining after all."
18vvfyb,Anxiety,2024-01-01,Shortness of breath throughout the day.,"Hi, I've been suffering for 6 months with shortness of breath. I went to see a doctor and he prescribed me PPIs for reflux. 

Before I felt this, I had a trip coming up and I will admit I was slightly anxious about this. But since that trip it's not gone away and seems that I've developed shakiness and nausea to accompany it.

Does anyone know if this sounds more like anxiety than reflux. I'm definitely anxious typing this but not feeling short of breath. 

Just need a bit of help"
18vpoqy,Anxiety,2024-01-01,Anxious that social circle ignores me for no reason 22F,"For the past 3 years, i've (22F) been living in a small town without a single real buddy. I moved here because my old city statistically wasnt good crime wise, thinking i’d be in for a better life here…Ever since moving here, i’ve made a huge effort to create a social circle of pals, mostly with fellow women my age. I’ve been attending lots of social gatherings in town, events, joined local community groups, facebook social groups in my area, but literally nothing has worked when it comes to meeting new people. I’m always the one having to gently approach these people and strike up a conversation, or else nobody speaks to me. I smile at every one, i dont have a mean look on my face, i dont smell bad, i enjoy making every person feel welcome, yet i’m ignored. I present myself well in a classy yet laidback manner, i have respect for everyone, and i truly enjoy making people smile with compliments that arent creepy or overbearing. Yet, it seems like this just isnt enough for them. I wouldve thought fellow women my age in this town would like to speak with me or would be open to a new gal pal, but no. Its really suprising for me.   
I do my very best to talk &amp; strike up a conversation, i like making every person feel included. But when the social gatherings are done, they dont speak to me at all afterwards &amp; completely ignore me. I’m never spoken to, i’m never text, never invited out, or given a damn about by these people. I’m always the one having to invite these people out places, or else they dont invite me out at all &amp; i feel like i’m stuck in my room. I love going out to fun places and living life, but its hard always being the one asking people to go out or else they dont give a hoot to invite me anywhere. I’m always just ignored by these people.   
Whenever i add “friends” on my facebook i get no conversation, no nothing. My messages inbox is totally empty. Nobody ever texts me first, asks me how i’m doing or how my day has been, nothing. I’m always the one having to text first, then they dont ever text me again when i literally did nothing wrong. I post pictures of myself often (i’m a makeup artist too so i enjoy dolling my face up &amp; dressing nice when i go out), yet nobody comments anything nice on my pics not even a compliment, when i compliment them on their photos.   
Let me add, i’ve done absolutely nothing, literally nothing wrong whatsoever to make people want to avoid speaking to me or have any reason to dislike me. I am not being full of myself at all, but i do take care of myself well &amp; take pride in carrying myself well, i have a small business doing nails, i enjoy dressing nice &amp; doing up my hair n' makeup, so i will admit this has attracted lots of jealously from people. I never show off, i’m always very inclusive &amp; i welcome everyone with open arms. So it breaks my heart i’m constantly being treated like i’m invisible.   
I thought i did have a buddy whom i met on facebook not far from my town, she would comment nice stuff on my phtotos and would text me…Until completely out of nowhere she began cancelling plans when we never met in-person before &amp; only kept asking me for money, then wouldnt speak me to when i was unable to give her money. So i got tired of her constantly only asking me for my money then ignoring me when i couldnt give her any, so i blocked her off &amp; that was it. Since then, my social circle has been so unsuccesful and i know for a fact its not my fault at all.   
I am tired of always being kind, always being kind, and having so much qualities to offer, yet always being treated like a ghost in return.... I really wish i had a buddy but i truly feel so anxious, depressed and let down always trying to meet people but ignored like this.   
Its been years since living in this small town &amp; at the moment i’m unable to move out, or else i’d totally be out of here. I wake up with awful anxiety every morning &amp; a huge contributor is what I'm going through with not having any buddies. "

I think the only thing terrifying me the most is the IV start— I am terrible with needles. Typically with blood draws and shots, I’m pretty fine. The skill of the nurse definitely helps. But regarding an IV start, my last IV for previous dental sedation was terrible— pain that sat there in my hand for 10-15 seconds.

The past three days I’ve woken up with a panic attack, immediately feeling my heart pounding and my body shivering as I wake up. The other day I spent 4 hours going though waves of pain and panic. It’s extreme traumatizing. 

I know I’m not alone, and was wondering how others with panic disorders deal with the anticipation of having another excruciating panic episode like they have had in the past.

Me and him were strictly a secret thing. No one knew anything about us. There were a few pictures he had on his phone, not nudes but just pictures of us together and stuff.
 
I asked him to delete them and he said he did, which I believe him. But it still makes me anxious because there is not actual way of me knowing if he really did. I really don’t want those pictures sent or shown to anyone.

18vn0sd,Anxiety,2024-01-01,Propranolol,"Hey everyone!! 

Has anyone here had any experience with propranolol? 
I never had any problem with talking to people or teaching a class. Then I was teaching a course and out of no where this heat wave hit my body, started sweating, got all chocked up/ shaky voice. I had to leave the room to bring myself down. Ever since that first incident I’m overly aware of these feelings. It can start creeping in now with just a one on one conversation with someone. 

I work as a fire fighter and my therapist said it sounds like I’m having trouble getting my body out of its fight or flight mode. So now minor things are pushing me past that point because physically I’m already ready for something bad. 

From what I understand propranolol should work on these aspects. It’s weird because it’s not like I am nervous in my head about the situation( it can happen even talking to my mom) but my body just turns on me and wants to shut down."

18vm9bf,Anxiety,2024-01-01,I cant relax at home,"I recently got a new job and its really chill, i made some friends there and time goes by relatively quick i guess. but i now get unbelievable amounts of anxiety about work, outside of work. Whenever my shift starts i get over the anxiety im feeling and i end up feeling good at the end of the night but when im at home, im stressing all the time over the next time i have to show up. my brain knows theres nothing to be anxious over but my body doesnt care. I think its a multitude of reasons, being away from my home and family for so long so often, or working late so whenever i do finally get home, everyones asleep, or being so far that i feel so disconnected from what im used to and it makes me homesick(which is a problem ive always had, as a kid i couldnt even stay at a house just across the street overnight"". Im sure itll go away with time as it has before with every single job ive had, this anxiety being the reason i quit all but 2(this job included) jobs. I just dont know how long itll be til i feel better or until i cant take it and quit. This is exacerbated by the feeling of not being able to quit and having to deal it, i say feeling because its not fact, i know i can quit if i want to but i feel personally obligated to commit to a job again. I talked with my mom and even she said that if i need to quit then quit because mental health is more important than any job. but regardless i get anxiety to the point where im crying on the way there because i feel alone. it feels embarrassing to say out loud why but i need it to stop as soon as possible and i havent found any natural remedies that work. i cant even play games with my friends without the lingering feeling in the back of my head, body, everywhere. which is wild because playing with the boys got me through worse things like my breakup. i know itll all go away if my brother gets scheduled so we can go to work and home together, but they havent given him a training day or even a login email for the work app, but they did say he should get a day this coming week so thats good at face value. i just cant get my hopes up on them following through so i want to get past this feeling myself just in case and i dont know how yet"

18vlpzn,Anxiety,2024-01-01,Anxiety after eating?,"Hi everyone, I'm 22F. I've suffered from anxiety my whole life. I've had a very good handle on it for a while, but ever since I had covid recently it's been worse. I've had covid before about 2 years ago, and this didn't happen then. This time around I did end up vomiting one night, and i've done it plenty of times in the past. Of course it's not pleasant, but it happens. 
Ever since then, any time I eat I start having a panic attack after I'm done. I'm not over eating or anything, I'm actually eating slower to make sure I'm not. I'm just wondering if this has ever happened to someone else? I'm losing sleep over it now as it doesn't go away for a while. The panic attacks are bad enough to have me seated in front of the toilet in fear i'm either going to vomit, faint, or blow out the other end. 
If it helps, I'm also on 10mg lexapro. 

Any advice greatly appreciated!!!"
18vlk8b,Anxiety,2024-01-01,How to get over Regrets about specific things I didn’t do earlier,"So I don’t know what to call this other than anxiety abt small things or “micro-anxiety”, but yeah I could use some advice on kicking it. It’s gonna sound really stupid

Anyway for context I (19M) seem to keep thinking about, and getting bugged, annoyed even upset about the fact that I hadn’t watched specific shows or listened to certain music that’s good in my taste earlier in my tween/teenage years. (Ex random examples wishing I had watched Game of Thrones earlier, I recently started it, or had actually listened to Radiohead more earlier). A big part of the reason for this is when other people my age know about/already enjoyed these things and I feel behind, left out, like I missed out.

I know or at least think it’s small and insignificant but it keeps bugging me, and it spirals into a broader issue where I wish I could or would have done things differently in the past, and general regrets I have about my whole last 7 years of life. I question my identity based on not doing certain things earlier. Then of course I have more serious life regrets to. 

In general what are good strategies and just a new way to think that’ll help me move beyond big and small regrets? I know meditation, spending time in nature, hobbies, and especially journaling about the specific things I regret helps me, but even after doing these things the thoughts come back, what should I do?

I have OCD btw so I know I can continually have obsessive thoughts abt things and it’s best to just kind of let them happen.

TLDR: How can I get over small and big regrets? Be more present and worry less abt the past and future."
18vlife,Anxiety,2024-01-01,my mind is blank,"Hello, all! I have been in therapy since around May 2023. What caused me to seek therapy was anxiety, with some specific focus on driving anxiety. As therapy has progressed, me and my therapist have identified that I have a general fear of failure and the unknown, as well as said driving anxiety. My main issue is that in the earlier sessions we would use a sort of CBT framework to try and crack my anxious thoughts, but it seemed like there were none. Like, when I'm anxious, I'm not thinking, I'm just anxious. This was interesting to my therapist, and after a bit we came to the conclusion that something is really guarding my anxious thoughts, and that I dissociate quite a bit as well when emotion comes to the surface for me. Additionally, I seem to have poor awareness of my own anxiety until it is very intense. For example, I won't realize something is making me anxious until I'm super close to having to do it, and have a more intense anxiety response to it as it gets closer and closer. Whenever I'm prompted to come up with the thought behind my anxiety, it feels like a guess. It doesn't feel like I'm saying something accurate to me, per se, and instead it just feels like I'm creating a thought that I assume would be an anxious thought. This created roadblocks in using CBT, and we have since done more of an exposure therapy thing focusing on driving, which seems to work better, but leaves my other anxiety themes unaddressed. This is further complicated by the fact that I can't even really feel that I know what my own anxiety is triggered by, and I feel like my mind is blank. My internal monologue isn't anxious, and I can only create a hypothesis to why I'm anxious if heavily prompted. I don't have any spontaneous anxious thoughts, or really much spontaneous thought at all. It literally feels like I'm just coasting on autopilot until my therapist essentially makes me confront what could \*possibly\*, \*maybe\* be making me anxious. I am not sure if this really makes much sense at all, or if anyone relates. Honestly I don't even know what my goal in writing this was - I guess just to write down something that has been quietly nagging at me for a while. If you have any insight as to how I may increase my awareness of my anxiety or even just a similar experience I would love to hear!"

I tend to make new accounts for social platforms all the time and try to avoid looking at anything I texted or did in the past. It doesn't matter if it's 10 minutes or 10 years. I get a lot of anxiety looking at anything I have made and especially others people's reaction to it.

Real examples:
1. Make a new Instagram account and posting couple pictures and not being able to ever look at them or look at my profile and making new account and the loop continues.

2. Messaging a friend and next day trying to cover my past sent text message so I can't see them

3. Doing a big school project and delaying it as much as possible because I can't look what I have done already.

4. Can't look at my posts on reddit and their comments at all without major anxiety and discomfort.

I think I tend to regret everything I do even if it's good or bad. Anyone else feel like this or has advice?"

i (23M) since i was 13 i have been though a lot of trauma.. i have been though severe depression a social anxiety , loneliness, overthinking, insomnia..
that made me realise my life won't change and i won't get what i want i knew it won't get better for me i knew my life won't change to be better i knew my limits that I can't change my life and all that at a young age.

so i tried to be more social since im intervort and i had social anxiety i wanted to make friends so they could help me at the hard times but they weren't always there for me i felt always alone i felt hopeless i didn't know what to do. 

so i decided to end it at a young age but i remembered that im so young and my life is just at its beginning why i would do something like that i don't have enough knowledge about this world i gotta grow up and meet new ppl and make new acquaintances and specially friends close ones that can help me though life also to have a goal a dream that will give me hope makes me want to live and leave everything upsets me behind why i bother myself with something that already happened.

so i moved on with my life giving myself a hope my life would change i used to listen to this motivational quotes tomorrow will be better , there's light at the end of the tunnel there's hope..

i did want to believe it i did want to change my life to be better though i knew deep inside it won't so I tried to be more social i tried to be nice with anyone i tried to be more positive I hopped for better tomorrow at the end..

i couldn't achieve anything not a single thing i was alone depressed realising that it only got worse for me my social anxiety couldn't let me get close friends i was even ignoring any social encounter my loneliness didn't change a bit less even i think i was wasting time lying to myself it will get better..

English isn't my first language , i hope it was clear for u all , Thanks for reading."

I would be traveling for about 2 weeks with my mom and maybe my brother, but as far as I know I am the only one planning anything. But I am so overwhelmed with anxiety about traveling that I haven’t really thought about the trip beyond trying to learn Japanese. When I want to sit down and gather things I want to see and do, I get so much anxiety and decide to put it off for another time. 
Last time I traveled, Mexico in spring 2022, my parents were in charge of just about everything and I had anxiety attacks for nearly the whole week. I don’t know what caused it, but I was miserable. I can only think it has something to do with the pandemic, because pre-pandemic I had traveled fine and even did a solo trip as a teen. But also it’s thinking that this may be a one-time trip, seeing as it will be a long-ass flight from the US and flying can become physically painful for me. I want to make sure I do and see everything I want to but am also afraid I’ll get overwhelmed and overstimulated. I’m also afraid of being an “ignorant American” and disrespecting people or doing something I shouldn’t.

18viu56,Anxiety,2023-12-31,One of the weirdest days with anxiety,"Hi, been using setraline since 14 dec and now 50mg since 27 December. After adjusting I’ve been really tired, even more than on 25mg. Stool has been awful and then just discomfort in the stomach. Fast forward to yesterday were I was just really tired and spent most of the day in the bed, I at night felt really hungry and hadn’t been eating well earlier (or in general, I’m really bad at it) and it may have caused a little low blood sugar and mixed with anxiety, it really just went into a shitshow. One of the worst feelings is of course the feeling like you are about to faint and headache. I did then get to sleep and today have been soo weird. Woke up so confused and like out of my body (but not quite) and hungry. I spent most of the day in the bed, thinking and feeling bad about myself and crying - really went into a dark spiral. I thought was going insane or something. While also being hungry, sad, heavy headed and the feeling you are about to faint / pass out, it just got too much and I cried for so long.

18vimgy,Anxiety,2023-12-31,Gabapentin &amp; L-Theanine cause anxiety?,"Hi all. So, question. I was on gabapentin for about a year to treat pain from a physical issue, and during that time my suicidal thoughts skyrocketed. I can't remember exactly how bad the anxiety I experience was while I was on it, but when I stopped taking it (didn't taper, obviously should have), I experienced pretty extreme rebound anxiety. I couldn't go on a walk more than half a block from my home without having to call my husband to come get me. This kind of extreme anxiety lasted for several weeks. A few years prior to this, I had tried taking L-Theanine for a few months. When I would first take it, I experienced lowered levels of anxiety, but then as it wore off, they'd be higher than ever. It was like the anxiety baseline rose dramatically. I actually had my worst ever panic attack while on l-theanine, resulting in my not being able to sleep for a little over 48 hours, with my heart racing the whole time. Needless to say, I got off of it. But with both the L-Theanine and the gabapentin, it felt like I had residual panic for almost a year after quitting each one. 

It just feels like the things that are supposed to calm me down actually make me worse, and take a very long time to work their way out of my system. I've had mixed results with taking chamomile, sam-e, and 5htp, and some luck with tryptophan. When I talk to my healthcare providers about it, I feel a little dismissed, or maybe as though they view me as a hypochondriac.

Has anyone else ever had supplements or drugs that are supposed to help quell anxiety actually make it so much worse? What has worked for you? Has anyone else had residual panic from supplements that lasted a long time after they stopped taking them?

I am curious about possibly taking something long-term to help with the anxiety I experience, but I'm very put off by my past experiences."
18vii8v,Anxiety,2023-12-31,Please give advice or share your story.,"I’m 23f, never struggled with anxiety until about 4 months ago (August).

I’ve had so many physical symptoms to the point where I think i’m dying, i always think i’m having a heart attack when I have chest pains and stuff. I went to the hospital 3 times in October, 1st time I was told I have costochondritis, 2nd time GAD, third time was for me not being about to eat so they put that as like gerd… since august i’ve booked every doctors appt under the sun, I’ve been to the cardiologist, they told me i’m fine but I just can’t believe it because my chest pains are telling me other wise. I’ve been to a neurologist (was told i have chiari malformation so now i’m freaking out about this). My periods have been so irregular (idk if it’s from stress). I’be convinced myself i have every cancer. My headaches make me think i’m going to die from a stroke or aneurysm. Like pleaseeeeee help me. I don’t know what to do, I feel so helpless, I want to go back to a time when i didn’t have a worry in the world and was just enjoying daily life without thinking the worst thing happening to me.

Also just to add, I noticed these symptoms started when anxiety started to feel too hard to handle.

Complete switch in emotions, although my actions and response to situations are mostly same as before.

Completely lost interest in everything / Anhedonia ( seems like the best description for this )

Feeling very empty inside

Emotions sort of feel like pain always

Increased libido

Irritability ( although I was this way for my whole life )

18vhi0j,Anxiety,2023-12-31,Does Anxiety Ever Get Better? Does Therapy/and or Medication Actually Help?,"Hello, everyone.

This is somewhat of a rant, though I am curious if anyone has gotten better after going to therapy and/or beginning to take medication for their anxiety.

I am a 32M and I've had anxiety for as long as I can remember, though my worries have changed over the years. I was always worried about different things growing up, but it wasn't until I turned 18 that my anxiety took a turn for the worse. Between the ages of 18 - 24, my anxiety progressed into agoraphobia, which resulted in me not leaving my house for this stretch of time (there were stretches of time during these 6 years that I couldn't even leave my bedroom). I don't know what happened, but one day I just stopped worrying about going outside and went out. While agoraphobia took 6 years of my life away from me, I've since lived a productive life. I've achieved my Bachelor's degree, got married, am successful in my career, bought a house, and my wife and I have two wonderful children together, but my anxiety is still there, just in a different form..

Since my wife and I got married, my anxiety shifted to health anxiety, primarily the fear that I have cancer. Over the past 8 years, I've convinced myself that I've had every form of cancer because I feel achy in a certain area, or I feel a bump. For the past 2 years, my primary fear has been testicular cancer as a family friend died from the disease in his 20s. As a result, every time I feel achy down there, I immediately think I have this form of cancer. I also keep doing self exams to the point where I get sore down there. I never feel any lumps, but if I don't find anything I think to myself, ""I must have done it wrong. Let me check again."" or I'll check an area that feels a bit sensitive or tender (the latter possibly being from checking so much) and I'll immediately begin to panic. I keep telling myself that I'm fine, I have no pain down there (aside from the sensitivity and or tender feeling every now and then), but never any actual pain... and no lumps.... but I can't help convincing myself that I have testicular cancer. And whats annoying as hell is that if I wasn't worried about testicular cancer, I'd be worried about another form of cancer, constantly checking for that one.

While my health anxiety is enough to deal with, I also have severe white coat syndrome, as well. While I'm petrified of there being something wrong with me health wise; I'm even more afraid of going to a doctor and for them to actually confirm that there is something wrong with me, and then putting an expiration date on me.  The last time I went to the doctor for a physical was in the Fall 2015. Everything was fine then, but I haven't been able to push myself to go since. Since the Fall of 2015, I've only been sick twice (not including the seasonal common cold), both times with COVID. I check my temperature regularly and during that time, I've only had a fever twice, both times coming when I had COVID. Aside from needing to lose a little bit of weight, I'd say that I'm in okay health, and I'm constantly trying to tell myself that... but it doesn't work most days and I'm just fed up with it.

I do live a productive life, though a lot of it comes as a result of me pushing my anxiety down during the day. I have to work, take care of my family, etc... so when I'm busy with that stuff, I push my anxiety down to where I can only focus on the aforementioned tasks. However, when I have a moment to myself or some free time, my anxiety consumes me and my worries (at this point, my health anxiety) to where every free moment I get is just me sitting around worrying and its becoming upsetting. I think a lot of my health anxiety stems from my time with agoraphobia. Agoraphobia took 6 years of my life from me. Now that I've got my life on track and I have everything that I've always wanted, I fear that some disease will take it all away from me. That said disease will make it so I can't grow old with my wife, to watch my kids grow up, etc.. I don't know... at this point I'm just rambling.

So if you've made it this far, thank you for reading my rant. Now comes my question:

Does therapy and/or medication actually help? In 2024, I want to try and tackle this anxiety. To start, I want to begin talking with a doctor that specializes in treating anxiety, then I want to go and actually get a physical to put all my health anxiety worries to bed.

With therapy and/or medication, did you find that it changed your life? I want to be able to just stop worrying and feeling like this when it comes to my health. I want to be one of those people that actually goes to the doctor instead of not going out of fear that something may be wrong. If I did find something on me (i.e., a lump from a self exam), I want to be like one of those people I've read about where they book an appointment the next day to get it checked, rather than avoiding it entirely as the fear or knowing outweighs what it could possibly be. I just want to stop worrying and feeling this way. I just want to live a normal life.

18vgwul,Anxiety,2023-12-31,Shortness of Breath 24/7,"Hi everyone.

I'm hoping for some input and possible help in terms of finding out what's going on with me.

Around 6 months ago I had sudden shortness of breath around 2 weeks before a holiday I was going on. The night before the holiday I had a bad episode where it felt like I couldn't breath and had the paramedics out.

They concluded that it was a panic attack and that I was fine (they ran oxygen tests and whatnot). I went to my GP after my holiday and he prescribed me PPIs under the assumption of Silent Reflux. 

The PPIs didn't help really and the second batch I began taking made me ill so I stopped them. I'm currently on more which are better for my stomach but still getting bouts of SOB.

I've come to this subreddit because for the last month I've had really bad social anxiety about going outside and I've got it in my head that a cause for all of this could just be that I was anxious originally. 

I've always been an anxious person but not to the point of breathing difficulties. 

I'm an avid Airsofter so I enjoy going out and doing sports. It seems that the shortness of breath disappears when I'm not focused on it

Can it just happen out of nowhere and can it be a constant even though I don't feel anxious? Or could it be reflux related instead. 
(Don't think it is as it came out of nowhere)

Sorry for the long read. 

Thank you."

Right now i’m spiraling over some swollen fatty tissue that i undoubtedly caused myself because it’s a spot that i grab everyday to examine myself for any lumps/bumps. 

I’m so sick of having a body. Health anxiety is the absolute worst because you can’t escape your trigger, there’s no break, you just have to live with it every second of everyday.

18vghhw,Anxiety,2023-12-31,Feeling of impending doom,"TW: death

I've been feeling like this for a while, actually ever since my life got more stable. I have this feeling that something bad will happen to me because why would I deserve to feel good and stable? I've met with an old friend yesterday who's going through a lot in life and I just felt so ashamed of myself I avoided saying that things were alright, and again I got hit by that feeling of impending doom.

Recently I've also been thinking about death and seeing signs of it here and there, and it's a subject that generally scares me. My SO had a dream about it, the same friend I saw yesterday mentioned an acquaintance of hers who recently lost her partner, and this gave me a huge panic attack yesterday. I took it for a sign that something will definitely happen to me or SO soon and this just destroyed me.

For those who went through these feelings of doom and close death, did something actually happen? Was it intuition or mainly irrational fear and anxiety?"

So I would do coherence breathing

For me this helps me get into the meditative state far more easily than doing no thought.

Also I have done a Vipassana 10 day silent meditation. The first three days are all about feeling the sensation of the air going in and out of your nose.

For 10 hours. You focus on your breathing.

When I get people to do breathing exercises and breathwork. It becomes far easier to do meditation. Over time of course.

 Ive dealt with anxiety disorders since i was 12. 

I posted a few weeks ago about having a small health problem (constipation that hurt and gave me hemorrhoids) and freaking out after searching online for some suggestions on dealing with it because my wife passed away from colon cancer a couple years ago and the internet makes you think you have everything. Then when i was starting to feel at ease, I received an unsolicted Cologuard test in the mail( i am 49), and it srnt me over the edge. I went to urgent care, and she saw the hemorrhoid and perscribed stuff and i felt a bit better. 

The problem I'm having is that my stomach hasnt been perfect since. I concentrate constantly on my bowel movements (which have been ok overall) and any little pain i feel on my stomack or lower back and panicking. 

I have had GERD and diabetes for years, plus my family has always had stomach issues and ofcourse have dealt with stomach problems before but i can't get myself to relax and realize everything is probably fine, just my nerves making it worse. When i am not thinking about it, i tend to feel nothing wrong, but when i do think about it. I get gassy, feel little pains all around my mid section , etc..

Now when I think about the future, I think I’m not going to make it there…

For example, I feel like I won’t be able to see my parents grow old, I feel like I won’t be able to have children, get married, finish college, grow old with my sisters, travel the world like I wanted to. 

Whenever I see my parents making plans for the future I think “I don’t even know if I’m going to be here to see it”

18ve7rx,Anxiety,2023-12-31,Stuck in DR,"
I'm really struggling. I have OCD.  I've experienced dpdr several times before, and I usually came out of it within 2 weeks or so, but this time feels so real and so alarming and I cannot shake it. 

I had a panic attack last Friday (before Christmas) that started my derealization feelings. I have tried to accept the thoughts (maybe nothing is real,maybe it is) , I have tried to challenge the thoughts (if nothing was real, then how could _____ happen?) , and I have tried to sit with the anxiety caused by agreeing with the thoughts (okay fine. So you made it all up. What now? What's the point?). 

I can't even get through a grounding exercise without the thoughts intruding. For example, I'll start with touch and think ""I'm touching the seat in the car. That I made up. This isn't real. How do I even know this grounding technique will work? I made that up to. I probably made up OCD and all the coping mechanisms I've ever tried."" 

Part of me knows somewhere deep down that this is just one of OCDs many tricks to stick around, but I cannot see a way out of this. 

I am on Zoloft 200mg, and I've been taking Vistaril 2x a day, but I know the anxiety is still high because even laying here and typing this my feet are sweating like crazy. I don't know what to do. I feel trapped for good this time.

The minute I try to do things, even talking to my kids or husband, I'm like ""omg I made all this up, what is the point if it's all stuff I made up"" and it fills me with panic."

18vctej,Anxiety,2023-12-31,"Took a clonazapam prior to a social event...then it got cancelled. I feel completely ""normal"" now. This is a strange and absolutely m feeling to be without excess worry. What are some alternate meds or edibles or herbs that can help me feel this way more frequently without the use of it?","Hi everyone, lifetime sufferer of panic disorder, agoraphobia, and GAD. Also, recently went mostly blind after my autoimmune disease decided to target my eyes. With all my symptoms, both physical and mental, I feel like I am in a constant state of deep stress. I took a clonazapam in prep for a social event which usually illicits a panic attack but it got cancelled. So now im sitting here with a very minor dose 0.5 mg of clonazapam in my system and i just feel......normal. Like i can do normal things without feeling butterflies in my chest.

Background, I am a 30 year old man currently on Effexor XR (which helped bring me from daily panic attacks to simply having general enmity and occasional panic attacks during travel/stressful situations. 

In essense, what i want to know from your anecdotal accounts is the following (none of which is medical advice in any capacity, simply things to discus with my care providors):

1. Have edibles (namely the indica or purely CBD blends) elicited a similar calming response to clonazapom/benzos?
2. Are there any other medications that have worked for you in addition to  an SNRI/SSRI such as an antipsychotic that reduced your general anxiety and illicited that ""sedative"" effect?
3. Are there any other options i should consider, i should add that I am open to nearly anything at this point. 

Thank you all."
18vcpqk,Anxiety,2023-12-31,Zoloft causes anxiety in autistic teenager due to increasing norepinephrine,"My son has autism. He had self-injurious behaviors since age of 3y. We tried many drugs and supplements but nothing helped with that until we started Zoloft at 25mg at age of 9y. It was a miracle drug. The SIBs stopped and the mood stabilized. In recent years, we tried different ADHD meds to improve his attention, starting with Focalin, which worked moderately well, and then switching to Qelbree earlier this year, first at 100mg and then raising it to 300mg. Qelbree worked well at the beginning, making my son calmer and more focused. He even stopped flapping his hands, which never happened before. We had to wean him off Zoloft per doctor advice. About 4-5 months into Qelbree, our son started complaining about racing heart, chest pains, and intrusive negative thoughts. He couldn't focus on anything because of preoccupation with his negative thoughts. Any school demand would stress him a lot, causing anger outbursts. The school psychologist defined it as anxiety. We weaned him off Qelbree. He slowly became happier, but low threshold to stress continued. SIBs and hand flapping came back. After 5 months off Qelbree and slow improvements in mood, we decided to try Zoloft again, at 25mg. The first 2-3 days he was OK, became calmer, deeper thoughts, more meaningful conversations. And then racing thoughts, anxiety and inability to focus came back as  on Qelbree. I found out that Zoloft, besides being an SSRI, also blocks norepinephrine transporter although not as potently as SERT. This effect is similar to Qelbree, which is SNRI. I found an interesting article ""Norepinephrine-deficient mice lack responses to antidepressant drugs, including SSRIs."" The researchers found that ALL SSRIs except Lexapro need norepinephrine for their action. That includes Zoloft too. It appears the culprit of intrusive thoughts and increasing anxiety in my son is increase in norepinephrine. But on the other hand, it helps his calmness, cognition, speech and deeper thoughts. I am stuck. I like everything about Zoloft except it turns my son into a stressed teenager preoccupied with his intrusive racing thoughts and unable to focus. Has anyone been in this situation and found a solution to anxiety due to high NE levels?"
18vcf84,Anxiety,2023-12-31,Choking on food health anxiety,"I was eating some potatoes and i breathed in when swallowing and chocked on it and coughed immediately and then i felt fine, but because of stupid anxiety i keep thinking there’s food in my lungs as i coughed again and felt a massive pain in my chest that really hurt but the pain gone now. Is it possible for food to still be in my wind pipe or lungs without being in pain. Like would i still be coughing and not breathing if there was something still there"
18vc77u,Anxiety,2023-12-31,New Year’s Eve Anxiety,"Hello to all and happy almost New Year. I woke up today in a panic. Usually my anxiety is a late evening guest but this morning things were in full swing. I am going through some medical drama. Biopsy and surgery etc. I am waiting to find out if I have cancer or not. So it’s a pretty panic inducing month! Anyways…. I had all these plans today. I felt crippled and upset because as I felt my anxiety rising and thinking here we go again! The day is ruined. Instead I decided to take my dogs for a walk. It was cold at 32 degrees here in NC but the sun was shining. I bundled up and strapped my dogs in. We walked for 6 miles at my 34 year old turtle pace lol. While I walked I went on YouTube and searched for “how to accept my anxiety.” I always had anxiety. I have done therapy. No medication except hydroxyzine recently due to my medical anxiety. I am a type A overachiever and instead of distracting myself, I decided to try and learn how to sit with my feelings. The prospect of the whole sitting and feeling and accepting even brings me to tears. I am lonely and anxiety makes me feel alone. Anyways…. Sharing a link for this particular podcast. I have heard of Mel Robbins but never read or listened to her before. I don’t know if she has good advice but this particular episode was interesting. 
Not everyone has the same situation. Not everyone has the same anxiety or reasons for anxiety. But maybe this podcast will help you. It helped me a little and I will do my best to sit with my anxiety and learn to accept it. That is the mot challenging thing in my life right now.

Hope everyone has a nice Near Year’s Eve! Wishing you the best and while you may not be anxiety free today or tomorrow morning, know that you have been through anxious periods of life before and you made it through. ❤️"

18vbppu,Anxiety,2023-12-31,Body Tingling,"Hey everyone,

Yesterday I woke up with this tingly, prickly/buzzing sensation all over my body. Legs, feet, hands, arms, sometimes my back and face, ears as well. It’s been like this 24/7 nonstop and it’s a sensory nightmare, it’s all I can focus on.

It’s not at all painful, and there’s no numbness involved. I’m trying not to go down a rabbit hole on google and scare myself, but the way it just happened out of nowhere is kind of stressing me out. 

I have a doctor appt later this week, so maybe it’s something or maybe it’s nothing at all. Just wondering if anyone else has experienced this and it could just be a sympton of anxiety? Hard to concentrate on anything when this feeling is all over."
18varii,Anxiety,2023-12-31,I did it!,"I went to the gym! For the first time in 3 months I dragged my arse to the gym yesterday and did an actual workout despite my head telling me not to. 
My body absolutely hates me for it today but my brain hasn’t felt this clear in months. 
I’m sorry if this sounds like a brag (and it is) but believe me, it is possible to get back to a place before the anxiety took over your life, I promise you it is. 
Happy new year everyone, may your symptoms be light and your conscience’s be clear."
18vaqzc,Anxiety,2023-12-31,Thoughts on Buspar or Buspirone for anxiety,"I’m on day 3 of Buspar for anxiety caused by a hormone imbalance (perimenopause). I’m also on medication to fix the hormone balance. 

I was wondering if anyone has treated their anxiety successfully with Buspar alone? I won’t be able to get a psychiatrist( Canadian healthcare) so I have to go to my gp for medication. 

My doctor is willing to let me try Prozac next but I want to give this a medication a go because I did not handle Lexapro well and I don’t necessarily want to hit another SSRI yet."
18vaqio,Anxiety,2023-12-31,"Please tell me I'm not alone, I'm so tired of feeling this way. I'm so scared, so alone, so tired","Last spring around March or so I got bronchitis, my nephews girlfriend died unexpectedly, and then my anxiety just started going wild! I was on 5mg of paxil at the time trying to wean off of it. I went back up to 10 now I'm on 20mg. I haven't had bad bad anxiety since last spring but I came down with the flu or something on Christmas and been waking up with the same anxiety from the spring. Dry mouth, dry heaves, nausea, diarrhea, I can hardly eat anything, I'm cold, I'm tired, I wake up stomach in knots, I feel like I'm dying but idk what I would be dying of, I can't shake the feeling until hours later, by 3-4pm I start feeling normal again. I usually can eat a little bit of food for dinner and I feel pretty normal. Go to bed and wake up around 7:30 like clock work in a spiral again. I am so scared I'm dying or something, I can't make the feeling stop and that's all I want, I want it to stop. I want to be normal. I want to feel like myself again and not scared."
18vaot3,Anxiety,2023-12-31,Heart pain #heartpain #anxiety,"Hello everyone.
I really need your help here.
My husband has pain in his heart from time to another. Yesterday we went to the ER, did EKG, chest X ray, and blood tests. Everything turned out fine.
Few months ago he has an echocardiogram, and it was perfectly fine.
But he’s still having pain from time to another.
Have anyone ever experienced something similar?
I’m very very worried."
18vamzv,Anxiety,2023-12-31,I just left the house alone for the first time in months.,I don't really have anyone to share this with since it's so benign to most people. But I've essentially been a hermit all year. I've had crippling anxiety due to medication changes before it settled into my normal anxiety. The last couple of months I've been afraid to leave the house and afraid to drive. Today I drove to pick up my medicine. I hope things get better next year.
