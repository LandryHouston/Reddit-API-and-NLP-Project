I'm terrified of getting sick and throwing up. The food looks fine and it smells fine but I can't swallow it or eat it. My brain is telling me the food is rotting or poisoned even though I know in my head it's not.


I don't need judgment and I'm not asking for medical advice but please if anyone has information on where I can go to get help please tell me. I can't keep buying new groceries."

I used to struggle really bad with anxiety when I was in middle school but over time I learned how to manage it but the fact that it came out of nowhere again caught me so off guard. I just want to feel like my authentic self again, I know I‚Äôll probably get through this but it‚Äôs hard because my symptoms gets in the way (I‚Äôm a college student) it‚Äôs hard for me to focus because of brain fog and my scary intrusive thoughts. When I try to socialize with people it‚Äôs hard to get a good flow because of my confidence drop and my anxious thoughts getting in the way. I‚Äôm in a new environment as well, I transferred to university a couple of days ago and I live on campus now and I feel so separated from my friends and family.

193edga,Anxiety,2024-01-10,"Heavy Anxiety for the dumbest reason, need help overcoming it","Hey everyone, I unfortunately suffer from Anxiety-Episodes every now and then mostly health related. One of my worst (and most irrational) fears is hair loss. 

Last week while taking a look at the mirror I somehow convinced myself that my right temple has receded a tiny little bit. This caused me to go into a deep and horrendous anxiety-episode which has lasted for over a week now in which I have been almost constantly anxious about this stupid right temple.

Now I rationally know that nothing really changed (Actually had the same anxiety attack about a year ago) but in the back of my head there's this almost neurotic conviction that something did change and that I'm about to lose my hair. 

Managed to make some progress in combating this Anxiety Episode but still can't quite overcome this feeling of dread/fear. Since the reason for my anxiety is so stupid I feel too ashamed to talk to someone irl about it, so I'm asking if anyone has dealt with similar things and might be able to help a little..

I‚Äôve been obsessed with the idea that I‚Äôm a bad person and my anxiety trying to dig through everything in my life to prove it. I feel like I need to be overly honest with everyone about what I‚Äôve done in order to be assured I‚Äôm not a bad person. 

I‚Äôm talking to my doctor tomorrow about this but I was wondering if anyone else has experienced this or any ideas of how to cope with it? For reference I am already in escitalopram and propranolol to treat my anxiety."

193dmta,Anxiety,2024-01-10,"Anxiety, Insomnia, and Anger","I have no right to get upset when my friends don't respond to my vents and panic. Because I almost always start having a panic attack and/or venting when it's like 1-2 am. 
I'm an insomniac, and when I'm supposed to be winding down... I'm winding up.
Like up up. Like skyhigh.
But of course, my friends are sleeping.
I don't have a lot of real-life friends. And I'm super awkward, I tend to get quiet and panic when surrounded by people because of how much I was bullied in middle school. So I only really have online friends, they're on the same level of dork as me... Y'know?
Anyways, despite the minor time differences. (The max being 3 hours for two of my friends) They're always sleeping or about to fall asleep when I'm up and panicking. Which SUCKS for me.
And I've noticed that I've started getting pissed about it. And anxiety and anger don't mix well, so I just feel worse. But like I said, I have no right. They're sleeping.
And I don't want therapy. I have a fear of therapists after my first ever one tried to gaslight me.

Any tips on how to cope?"

193ddj0,Anxiety,2024-01-10,Can‚Äôt tell if my heart is okay or not.,"So for some back story I developed agoraphobia august 2022. I stopped leaving my house and pretty much did nothing all day. I gained 30 pounds in like 4-5 months which is a little concerning to me( I was already a little bit overweight so now I guess I‚Äôm considered obese). By like May 2023 I was sitting in my bed all day. I have a crochet business so I‚Äôd just crochet all day and barely leave my room. I left my house a total of 2 times in 2023. 

Fast forward to now. I‚Äôve changed my diet, I‚Äôm in a calorie deficit and I‚Äôm trying to exercise. But here‚Äôs the thing, I feel like it might be too late for my heart. My resting rate is anywhere from 70-90 just kind of depends how I‚Äôm feeling. When i get up my heart rate will jump 30+ beats. I‚Äôve noticed when I‚Äôm standing my heart rate is usually around 102 which slightly worries me because that‚Äôs a little high. I have a waking pad and have been walking daily for a couple days now and I‚Äôve noticed my heart rate. I walked on speed 3 for 10 minutes and my heart rate was 150 when I got off. After about a minute it was at 120 and then it slowly went back down to 102ish. 

The weird thing is I feel like I don‚Äôt get out of breath really my heart just beats fast. After walking for 10 minutes (might not seem like a lot but I was averaging like 500 steps per day before) I could breathe fine but my heart like I said was beating fast. I don‚Äôt know if this is normal for someone who is very sedentary or if I should consider seeing a doctor. I still have agoraphobia and have trouble leaving my house but I‚Äôm hoping the exercise will maybe help with that a little. 

I did get labs done by my doctor back in August and everything was normal but that was about 5 months ago so who knows if I‚Äôm still healthy or not. All I know is I need to lose weight and honestly I already feel better about myself after I‚Äôve started walking. I‚Äôm getting about 7-7500 steps a day, I‚Äôll work up to 10000. But I literally went from 500-1000 steps to pretty much 7 times that within a day. 

I have a few other symptoms/ things I‚Äôve noticed (unrelated to my heart) that make me wonder if something is going on. But my doctor isn‚Äôt taking me seriously so I‚Äôm kinda at a loss."

193d25g,Anxiety,2024-01-10,Carrington Event,"‚ÄúIf the Carrington Event happened today, it would have even more severe impacts, such as widespread electrical disruptions, persistent blackouts, and interruptions to global communications. Such technological chaos could cripple economies and endanger the safety and livelihoods of people worldwide.‚Äù 
(URL: https://www.nasa.gov/science-research/heliophysics/nasa-enabled-ai-predictions-may-give-time-to-prepare-for-solar-storms/) 

Essentially, the Carrington Event is a geomagnetic storm caused by a solar flare from the sun. I‚Äôm not sure why, but is anyone else really fixated on this? I know I am, and what is odd tho is that I wouldn‚Äôt consider myself a doomsday preparer or waiting for the zombie apocalypse or nuclear fallout. but for some reason I get so anxious thinking about what would happen if this happens. 

my boyfriend is a wonderful human being, who does not experience anxiety at the same level as me, but is so understanding it could make me cry. And so, when I told him that I would get really anxious thinking about this, he made a pact with me that every year, we make a safety plan and what we would do if it happened and we weren‚Äôt near each other (e.g. what highway we would follow, who would stay where while the other went out, what we would pack). 

Like many with anxiety experience, I feel like a freaking lunatic for focusing on this so much and I have had legit panic attacks over this which makes me feel so lame. so again, just wondering if anyone has ever felt the same way?"

30m here and i think i need advice

i am currently dealing with my 4th covid infection - and the main symptom seems to be very strong anxiety üò¨

i haven't had any issues with anxiety in the past few months - in fact i did reaaally really well most of 2023 and went very optimistic into 2024

sadly, i tested positive on the 1st of January and am on my 9th day now

i had a couple of other symptoms like exhaustion, coughing, sneezing and tinnuts - but strangely enough also a whole load of anxiety

not anxiety about covid or my health - but rather a general sense of impending doom, like loosing it all, having fucked up my life etc.

has anybody else experienced this with Covid? how can i calm my nerves?

 i don't want to live like this :("
193con0,Anxiety,2024-01-10,Only genuine response please. Help me out.,"I have been always a loner. Never had any friends but there was one comfort for me and that was my phone but guess what!  It recently got snatched by thiefs. I was so desperate to get it back that I even fell for a phishing scam and ended up giving them my icloud credentials and phone's passcode since I was trying to locate its then location on find my iphone. That made things even worse for me. (I did take damage control steps afterwards like blocking cards etc).

That phone was my life, it had my whole life in it. My only escape was my phone. I was to attached. I can't even tell the pain I am feeling right now. It had so many of my memories, all my struggles and everything journaled in it.

Not only I am concerned about my privacy since I gave them the credentials. But I am missing my phone too. People say it's all materialistic but it was my only escape from my loneliness. I can't stop regretting whatever has happened. Why God always do this to me!! why

How do I get over it. It's been like two weeks but I am almost crying over it everyday. Feels like I am literally dead inside. Always anxious and feel panicking. I get up at nights and gets chills down my spine. That whole incident repeats in my mind in a loop and I end up regretting everything everytime.

I am literally tired of all this because it is not only affecting my health, my work and other things but most importantly it is affecting my family. I love them and they are so much worried seeing me like this makes me hate myself even more.
Please help me out please!!!!!"

I went months of just struggling with that. After I found some ways of helping it got way better. Fast forward I move away to college and I just went back for Christmas break. The first couple weeks were fine but then I started to get really bad anxiety being home. I started having a like sinking feeling or like falling feeling that I‚Äôve never felt before. I started thinking irrational thoughts like the world is falling or just weird thoughts like that. Time also started moving very slow again. Sometimes I feel like I can‚Äôt grip myself onto anything anymore. After coming back to school I thought it would help my anxiety but it didn‚Äôt. I can‚Äôt even sit in my hour long class without my mind going crazy with thoughts.

The main change has been that I can still feel the old worries trying to break free, but I'm just so low energy from only drinking decaf that they haven't had much chance to go nuts the way they usually do.

And honestly, as I read most people‚Äôs post about anxiety I wonder if that‚Äôs what the number one contributor to most people‚Äôs anxiety is.

As long as a feel ‚Äúhealthy‚Äù my anxiety is ok.  But I unfortunately do have health issues including  benign PVCs (heart palpitations where it feels like your heart skips a beat) as well as IBS and GERD, and any time one of my health issues flares up so does my anxiety. 

But ultimately it comes down to me being scared of dying and I don‚Äôt know how to get over that.  And honestly it feels like such a dumb problem to have. It feels like everyone else just walks around not thinking about it and I think about it daily.  Why?  I can‚Äôt control it.  I‚Äôm just so sick of it and tired of feeling this way.  Some days are better than others but the minute I start to not feel good the cycle starts over.

I‚Äôve never had any racing thoughts or freaked out in my mind during anxiety. My chest feels funny, I guess you could say it‚Äôs tight but there‚Äôs almost never any pain. It‚Äôs such a weird feeling it makes me want to clutch my chest or put pressure with my hand as if I am pledging allegiance to the flag. Much recently I have been experiencing a lump in my throat that makes me gag every time I am presented with a situation such as a job interview or something along those lines. It‚Äôs beginning to debilitate me because as the anxiety worsens and turns into a panic attack(been diagnosed with panic disorder) the gagging gets so bad that I will throw up. The gagging happens every morning which I theorize is due to natural high levels of cortisol in the morning and when I am driving to a stressful situation. I have had to pull over to throw up multiple times.

I‚Äôve been to an internal medicine doctor and all they recommended was peppermint because it relaxes the throat, i‚Äôve tried with varying degrees of success.

Basically I‚Äôm asking if anyone here has had any similar experiences and If they have found a fix without going on any serious meds."
193acy1,Anxiety,2024-01-10,New here and dealing with this buildup of anxiety for trip coming up,"So I just joined this group and felt bad venting about anxiety related stuff in another group for Bipolar disorder since it‚Äôs not really a space for that even though others have no issue venting about it. I wanted to ask someone who does deal with GAD (mine is on a severe side as I does affect my life decisions and prevents myself from doing things that could be fun).

I am weird about flying on planes. Even though I have been on a plane before and I have been fine in the past, I have a reoccurring fear of being in a plane crash. But strangely this isn‚Äôt the fear that is most consuming this time. It‚Äôs leaving my cats behind (I still live at home-I am an adult in college) and my family being responsible to care for them. This last year 2 cats (I have 3) have been attacked twice by the same dog we have in our house. We have gates up and everything so the dog cannot get to them now, however, the 2 cats got attacked the second time most recently in this past November and lucky didn‚Äôt need to go to the ER this time but still got punctured wounds that are still healing. One cat had to get a shot cause he got an abscess. The first time both got attacked on separate occasions, I wasn‚Äôt home and was at a friends. I was guilty and upset with myself because mom wasn‚Äôt around to comfort them. After my anxiety calmed down after months, I managed to be ok to leave the house to stay the night at friends again. Then in November, again on 2 separate occasions, both same cats got attacked and I was home but was asleep and woke up both times. 

My grandmother requested me to come care for her after her surgery and I leave this weekend (out of state). I‚Äôll be gone for a week for now because I‚Äôm not sure how long I‚Äôll stand to be away from my cats before I start having nervous break downs. The hypothetical scenarios are just constantly crossing my mind and the 2 I‚Äôve narrowed down are them being attacked and them being so depressed that I‚Äôm gone. I am home all the time so even though in the past they have been left at home (other people are there) and I have come back, I still feel guilty leaving them. Like I‚Äôm a bad pet parent. 

How the hell am I supposed to do this? I am currently having a mild anxiety attack and I‚Äôm on my work break trying to forget about this so I can focus. I don‚Äôt know how to self soothe myself that it‚Äôll be ok and that I cannot keep letting this prevent me from living my life."

I told myself repeatedly it's just anxiety and my body was like oh ok, you don't like that? How about some of this instead? So now I get this weird sensation of pressure in the lower part of my face.

Teeth clenching, Gum problem, Wisdom tooth, Swollen lymph nodes, One side neck so tense. Hard time breathing. Tension headaches. On off knee pain and now my balls feel uncomfortable from time to time.

I had my lymph nodes checked yesterday ENT said it was because of my gum problem and probably my wisdom. And the tension on my neck is probably how I sleep. I had the same thing checked last Aug. 

Today I had my eyes checked ran some tests and it was normal. Doctor gave me some eye drops.

the thing worrying me now is my knee pain and my balls feeling uncomfortable from time to time. Dont know if I‚Äôm just thinking about it so much.

I also feel like I have a lot of privileges in life, that should make things ‚Äúeasier‚Äù per-say. I even have days when my brain feels like I‚Äôm not stressed, but my body does. I get tension headaches, extreme fatigue. My doctor says I‚Äôm fine, no blood work was extremely out of ordinary. The only conclusion I can come to is that I am not cut out for modern society and life. Sometimes all I think about is escaping somewhere rural or a forest and getting rid of my smart phone. My therapist said that seems extreme, and like I‚Äôm just trying run away. But I‚Äôm just so tired of not feeling good every day, and all the stress I feel from life. I want to try out living somewhere rural and away from modern society and on my own, but of course I have some anxiety about that all too. Idk, am I crazy or does anyone else feel this way?"

I do have an appointment with my psychiatrist on Monday to see where to go from here but would like some opinions and maybe options of what it could be. 

I have been on medication for anxiety and depression since I was 14. I‚Äôve been in wellbutrin 300mg and Nuvigil 150mg for about 2 years. I was taken of exsira 100mg about 3 months ago and then given Trazadone 50mg to take instead to aid in sleep too. Since around that time period or just there after I started getting quite bad symptoms with my stomach. I have always had a sensitive stomach so thought this would subside after settling but it hasn‚Äôt. My symptoms are getting worse and it‚Äôs just unpleasant. No - I am not pregnant. Ive taken multiple pregnancy tests (8) over the last few months and they‚Äôre all negative/say not pregnant - my period is regular too and I have an IUD. My symptoms are the following: 

- Consistent nausea - some days are fine and I don‚Äôt feel sick at all; others I can‚Äôt even get out of bed or leave the toilet because I am Vomiting or just so nauseas. 
-No appetite most days
- I am having reflux - it‚Äôs feel like cold/warm and chunky coming up my chest sometimes
-Shortness of breath some days 
-Going between runny stomach, constipation and no bowl movements
-And the weirdest and latest is like a fluttering/pulse in my stomach. It‚Äôs the weirdest feeling and I don‚Äôt know how to describe it other than something is pulsating around my stomach.
-I‚Äôve also lost 10kgs and now weight 58kgs and am 172cm. 

Please advise and give suggestions. Thank you in advance."

Though I‚Äôve been able to manage it somewhat as I‚Äôve gotten older, it‚Äôs still there. For most of my twenties I used alcohol and drugs as a way to distract my brain until I started notice its toll on me. So I quit all that jazz a few years back. Most recently stopping using weed a few months back bc I just felt bogged down and felt it was making my anxiety worse. I‚Äôve always eaten really clean (contradictory to the drugs lol) and have been exercising for I‚Äôd say the last 6mo or so regularly. 

Would you all say that you find these health apps useful or detrimental? I‚Äôve been monitoring my heart rate and hrv to track my progress and recovery and have generally found some info useful.

1937orz,Anxiety,2024-01-10,Can't stop comparing myself to other more socially successful people. HELPP!! Tips?,"So, I have been recently comparing myself to other more socially successful people which has caused me intense and excessive anxiety. 

I can't study properly without this thoughts intervening in my head every 3 minutes. 

I don't consider I have a shitty social life. I have a few groups of friends here and there and I love them. We hang out whenever we can, go out or maybe stay in to watch movies or drink and gossip.

However, I still compare myself to other people. Specially people who aren't that social now but were back in their young times. Like my mother or aunties or father even. I know they lived in another time where people used to leave their homes more often and hang out in bars all together. Now these days people like to stay at home more, connect through social media and maybe get a drink or two 1 a week or not that often.

I know there is people a bit older than me that do go out every day. Like my mother used to do. But I don't and I compare myself with those people and I am terribly upset because of it. I realize that maybe I am not that sociable and extroverted as those people. Maybe I was not designed to follow that way of life. But it seems that everyone around me does in my family and I feel like a loner because of that. Even though I do have friends.

I do want people to see that I have friends and I want to stop comparing myself to those people. How do I stop this and be comfortable with what I got. I won't be happy until I am."
1937nn4,Anxiety,2024-01-10,Has anyone felt this?,"Sorry in advance for the long post‚Ä¶

So for a bit of background in early December I had a horrible panic attack while taking a shower and since then I‚Äôve struggled. After the initial panic attack I was fine for a few days then had another small one, it was so weird because I don‚Äôt normally have random panic attacks. I‚Äôve suffered from anxiety for as long as I can remember (24 now) but they‚Äôve always had some sort of trigger (storms, loud noises, too many people). So after that I spoke to my GP and she gave me 10mgs of Prozac which was awful I had horrible side effects (increased anxiety, loss of appetite, sleep issues, feeling like I couldn‚Äôt breathe, heart palpitations, derealization, depression, weakness, and crying fits) I stuck it out for 3 weeks before she switched me to Wellbutrin which was even worse before taking me off medication completely. 

Now I‚Äôve been off all medication for about a week and I feel a little bit better. I can leave the house again for short periods of time and I‚Äôm slowly getting back into my normal routine, but now I‚Äôm faced with another problem that I‚Äôm not sure where it‚Äôs coming from. I can eat again and do light activities but I constantly feel fatigued, dizzy, sometimes confused, easily agitated, my throat feels tight and I feel like I‚Äôm not breathing properly, and I experience derealization from time to time. Besides that I‚Äôm sleeping better and feeling more like myself. My GP said it‚Äôs just anxiety not I‚Äôm tired of hearing everything is ‚Äújust anxiety‚Äù. Maybe I‚Äôm worrying too much but has anyone else felt like this? It‚Äôs making me nervous which probably isn‚Äôt helping. Thank you for making it to the end and any help or advice would be greatly appreciated ü©∑"

I pointed out there have been solar storm warnings around this time of year for the past few years and people told me that this time it will be bad and we're all probably gonna die. I heard it's gonna knock out all wifi which would activate all nukes and it would knock out all power and we heavily rely on wifi and electricity to live. I'm too scared to research it more because I'm scared it's completely true and I'm gonna find something I don't wanna find.

1937cy0,Anxiety,2024-01-10,I beat social anxiety disorder,"Hi, 
This is weird to write but i think its important for me and anyone who might be reading this to hear.
Ive always been prone to anxiety, however around a decade ago I experienced multiple life events that lead me to having SAD - Social Anxiety Disorder. Although I was a happy, energized and extroverted kid I slowly fell into deep depression from my inability to present it (SAD controlled my life)

Years after, i was in a better environment which made me open up a bit more. It wasnt perfect, strangers still actively gave me panic attacks and people still considered me a snob for being too silent however it was the best i knew, and the best I thought it was going to get.

That was until 2 years ago, when my whole world turned upsidedown- I had to meet a lot of new people in a short span of time, speak up for myself, show emotions and seek help from strangers. My GAD (Generalised Anxiety Disorder) was at an all-time high, thats when i was finally went to get a diagnosis and medication.

I showed up to a new environment again, a good one. I now had my psycologist, medication and a fresh start.
I tried my best to ""be the one in control"" as people loved telling me- it never really worked..
However with enough good experiences i started craving social interaction instead of fearing it. I did things that made me feel good like helping a stranger on the street. Those positive interactions gave me motivation, i wanted more, even needed more!
Even simple goodmornings (that i said) in the morning started my day with a smile! In previous years i was always so quiet, that whenever i did speak i would have to clear my throat because it wasnt used for actual hours.


Today im okay, today  i try go embarrasse myself and it never WORKS
I no longer care about what people think about me and im just out here enjoying life.
It feels unreal, but it is. If you reached this far i hope this story gave you hope for a better future :)"
1937cxj,Anxiety,2024-01-10,Working out and Increased anxiety. Looking for people with years of training.,"Forgive the qualifier, I am just looking for input from people who have dabbled with different modalities. I‚Äôll explain; 

I have anxiety/OCD/panic and been working out/training for over a decade. Usually in the CrossFit/strength and conditioning space. I was in excellent shape and was suffering with this illness terribly. Few years back I bulged a disc and moved towards bodybuilding. No HIIT, no intense gasping fo air chippers or conditioning pieces. My cardio was long walks outside. I felt‚Ä¶incredible. I wasn‚Äôt waking up in the middle of the night to pee or just in general. My entire personality changed in some ways, I felt calm and open. I was taking damn selfies outside and sending them to my wife üòÜ.  All that being said,  happy and but discontent.  I liked the intense aspect of working out and wanted to be pushing myself doing extremely difficult workouts. Recently my back got better and I returned to my old workouts and lo and behold the weird stuff returns. Feeling neurotic and like panic is just around the corner, but also as insidious as this illness is, I can‚Äôt tell if I‚Äôm just psyching myself out. 

Anyhow, sorry for being long winded. I‚Äôm curious if there is anyone else out there who has had the same experiences. I would love to continue working out like this, but not at the cost of my wellness. Thanks for any help!"

i wish i could just disappear. i wish my entire existence would be erased. i am embarrassed of myself so much. i was humiliated so many times in my life for things that were out of my control. But as if that wasn't enough, i went ahead and fucked the rest of my life up too.

19376y7,Anxiety,2024-01-10,Holding Space for Anxiety,"Lately I have been trying to shift my focus away from questioning why I have anxiety (either in the moment or as a general statement) and suppressing it, towards holding space for my anxiety by acknowledging that it‚Äôs okay for it to exist, that I don‚Äôt need to hide parts of myself to ‚Äúfit in‚Äù. I have been reading some anxiety-focused self-help books and working with my therapist on how to safely hold space for anxiety without having it take over my daily life. So far, it has been liberating to take the pressure off of myself to not be anxious because it‚Äôs unrealistic for me. I now go into most situations expecting to be anxious and trying to be okay with it instead of telling myself ‚Äúyou better not be anxious‚Äù.

For those of you who have engaged with this practice, what methods did you find helpful in holding space for anxiety in your life? I also completely acknowledge that not everyone is comfortable with this or willing/able to do this and that‚Äôs okay!"
19371ur,Anxiety,2024-01-10,Is it possible for anxiety to manifest in unexpected ways?,"Last year (Sept.-Late Dec.) I had a terrible bout of  existential anxiety. I would think of death daily and had the usual symptoms (shoulder and back aches, strain on my neck, pinching chest, bouts of depression). Since then, I feel like Ive been doing a lot better.

But even after feeling okay, these early days of January (about the death stuff at least), a new problem has arisen. I feel like saliva has been pooling in my mouth, there are abunch of times when I feel hungry even after eating 3 full meals a day (dunno if its related to the saliva thing), constantly gassy (burps and toots), and sometimes I sweat quite a bit (unsure if its from worrying or its a symptom of something else). Should I be worried and contact a gut doctor or is this just me being paranoid as hell? Has anybody had something similar? What can I do about it or do you have any advice to give?"

I went to the ER for that....then it calmed to 150/100 and then eventually got normal readings after a week or so....at its best it is 103/63 (when all is good and I am calm).  I have worn a 24 hour monitor to check and it was fine....but cant help but wonder how my BP can just shoot up so high.

My latest health anxiety is I have had pain in a tooth when I chew something hard.  I had an xray last year and nothing came up.  I have seen the dentist a few times for cleanings, check ups and mentioned the tooth issue.  They checked etc and she thinks its probably a tiny crack that can not be seen (this also came up in my research).  But you want to know what else came up in my research.....BRAIN TUMOR!  Apparently something a tumor can cause freaking pain in the tooth or jaw.  ARGGGHHHHH.

I have an entire list of crazy health worries and diseases I thought I had - leukemia, diabetes (even though bloods were fine!), kidney disease, thryoid disease etc....the list goes on.  But my latest worry because of this tooth issue is so annoying.  Its not like I am imagining the pain when I chew somehting hard in one tooth.  I pray it is just a crack that cannot be seen."

Next on Saturday we are organising a bigger dinner for the closest family, around 15 people in total, because it is more in my comfort zone - to schedule that after the big day, when emotions will go away and I prepare mentally to participate.

And here it starts. 

Our parents are offended that we invited them only for the big dinner to celebrate, but not for the 15-minutes ceremony 2 days earlier. I have a solid public speaking anxiety, hate when whole attention is focused on me and don‚Äôt want to ruin my wedding with that feeling. Also we are not close with the parents - we live far from each other, meet only on birthdays or some special occasions which happen maybe 6 times per year? We do not trust them and can‚Äôt really relay on in case of the emergency, there is no really a bond between us. They are not giving us money or anything in regards with the marriage. And of course I cannot tell them that I have anxiety in front of my family - this is totally beyond of their understanding.

Back then I had panic attacks but got on 60mg (then down to 40) of Prozac and have been great since. Rarely had panic attacks, they were mild when I had them. Anyways, ever since I had the drinking incident I have had the worst anxiety of my life. Can‚Äôt sleep, can‚Äôt eat right, daily panic attacks (usually multiple). Note that I did get lazy about my medication in the weeks leading to this incident.

I have consistently been taking my medication for those 3 weeks but it isn‚Äôt seeming to get better. Basically what I am asking, will it get better? Will I go back to the way I was before?

We were all very frightened, as it was late at night, we were not expecting, and our house receives no random visits (our house is extremely easy to miss even during the day, let alone at night)

We did not open the door. My dad began handling the situation. He yelled through the door, ""who is it?""
and the response back sounded to be from a black woman judging on her accent, asking for someone named Angel.

We of course had no idea who Angel was... So we told her she was not here. The car in our driveway was parked there for almost another 10 minutes, im not sure if it was because they weren't sure how to back out or not.

I found out today that when someone asks for Angel, it means they are in danger and need help... My heart sank when I found out. This woman was most likely in immediate danger, and we didn't know. I'm so worried that she is not okay... If by any miracle anyone here knows anything about this, please let me know. Or if you are the person who was asking for Angel if you are okay. 

We live in NC if that narrows it down any.

My sister did call the police and told them about someone asking for Angel... they stationed across the street at a church for almost 3 hours.

I'm just so worried that this woman is not okay, if you were looking for Angel at a dark spooky looking house in North Carolina around 4-5 months ago at 10pm at night, let me know. Or if you know anyone who was, let me know if they're okay please"

I have lived a Low risk lifestyle I never had sex, i have never indulged in anything risky but yes I do have a bunch of tattoos and piercings but I always opt for clean and hygienic places.

19337is,Anxiety,2024-01-10,Fear of quitting SSRI,"I've been taking prozac (fluoxetine) 10mg for the past 4 years for anxiety and panic attacks. In the past 2 years I've developed solid coping mechanisms. I still get anxiety and the occasional panic attack in highly stressful situations, but I'm not afraid of it anymore, I just let it happen and move on with my life.

Now after 4 years I would like to try and see what I m like without the antidepressant. Also I've developed chronic acid reflux and I'm starting to suspect prozac is the culprit. My therapist fully supports this, but I'm so afraid that I'm only feeling so confident because of the meds and once I'm off them all my issues will return.

1932yem,Anxiety,2024-01-10,Suffocating anxiety,"My parents argue a lot and it's driving me crazy. It has come to a point where I get really bad anxiety even if they're just on the same floor and I actively avoid being around them when they're together. It feels like I'm walking on eggshells around them. The slightest breath can send them into a frenzy of shouting. 
And when they do argue, my anxiety gets so bad that I find it hard to breathe. My lungs won't expand and I can't get full breaths of air. The worst part is that I freeze up. My body won't move so I just sit there, forced to listen to everything. 
Over time I've developed a coping technique (which really isn't the best). Whenever they start arguing I just go on my phone and try my best to ignore them. This technique barely helps but I don't know what else to do. Besides, I've been unable to do things that I'm supposed to be doing (like studying) just because I'm curled up in a corner with crippling anxiety and my phone.
My parents know I don't like them arguing. I've showed them how much I hate it, but they don't change. It's so frustrating and my anxiety isn't helping. 
Is there anyone facing the same problem? Any advice?"

My doctor is reffering me to a cardiologist to make sure nothing is wrong and that is making my anxiety so much worse but she said it could be 3/4 weeks before i hear for them to make an appointment. The fact that she thinks something could be wrong is stressing me out so much ive been crying ever since i got home.

I cannot fathom the fact that reality is reality.

I feel dissociated practically 24/7.  I don‚Äôt even know if I‚Äôm depressed anymore. I know I used to be every single day and I genuinely don‚Äôt remember if I have been recently. 

My anxiety is not crippling, though. I normally just say ‚Äúfuck it we ball, I‚Äôll deal with anxiety‚Äù to activities that will give me anxiety. Even to those things that shouldn‚Äôt give anxiety.

I (20m) need help figuring out how to move forward in my life. I'm graduating College next year and don't know what I want to do with my life or even how to do something with my life. I've always struggled co-existing with other people throught my life, I was diagnosed with clinical depression and high-functioning Autism a few years back and I've never in my 20 years had someone I could call a friend. I still don't have my license due to a fear of driving and haven't been able to hold a job long at all. I'm crippled by my extreme social anxiety and can't even hold conversations with others consistently. Therapy the past few years has helped, but nothing has really changed in my life and my anxiety seems to be getting worse.

I'm realizing now as I sit here that I will be a college graduate in a year, one who should be well adjusted and ready to join the workforce and start a career, and yet I've never had a first kiss, a best friend, still can't drive, and am terrified of extended human interraction. I feel lost and don't know what to do. Most nights I end up staring at walls just wondering what will become of me while staving off panic attacks. I'm not depressed enough to ""attempt"", I'm just scared and sad I think. I'm not really expecting any solutions here, but maybe I'm not alone, maybe someone can relate to what I'm feeling."

Year after year both my depression and anxiety got worse and worse. It‚Äôs gotten to a point where I‚Äôm scared to go out in public. You kinda of HAVE to do that in order to be a functioning adult. 

If I go to a store I hyperventilate, burn up, and get super shakey and dizzy. I‚Äôll have to hide in the bathroom until my mom is done shopping. Once I went on a date where I was going to take him to a sushi restaurant he wanted to go to. I walked in and was so nervous. It was packed. We went upstairs to see if there was any room up there but the second I saw how many people there were I just froze. He turned back at me wondering why I wasn‚Äôt following him and I tried smiling and playing it off but I was already crying. I was so shakey and hyperventilating I couldn‚Äôt stand. I had to sit in the hallway for a bit to stop crying and get my breathing back to normal. 

Sometimes I‚Äôll feel okay in public. But I‚Äôd have to both want and choose to go. I‚Äôd probably have a panic attack for a half an hour or so, but eventually my body adjusts and I can just have fun. That‚Äôs VERY rare though. 

I can‚Äôt even hold a job. If looking at a restaurant is enough to break me, the month I spent working destroyed me. I don‚Äôt think I can ever be the same again. The people there had shunned and bullied me. I‚Äôm searching for remote jobs but it‚Äôs so hard. 

If I can‚Äôt get a job or money I‚Äôll never be able to move out. I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm supposed to do or where to go from here. I feel so trapped. It‚Äôs like I‚Äôm suffocating. I can‚Äôt find a way out of this mess."

In grad school I knew I was capable of doing this job, but unlike most of my classmates I was the first in my family to attend college, let alone grad school. Everything was new to me, but my classmates seemed to know everything and be familiar with all the etiquette and terminology. In this time I developed severe impostor syndrome‚Äîeven though I knew I was smart enough to understand the concepts, figure things out or otherwise, I thought that one day, I‚Äôd make a few mistakes or so in the workplace and be ‚Äúdiscovered‚Äù that I‚Äôm actually a fraud and can‚Äôt do it. Almost like I would‚Äôve been lying to myself that I could do it.

In my profession, my job is known to be coveted. It‚Äôs temporary, but usually reserved only for people who have exemple my academic credentials. I didn‚Äôt end up having stellar credentials. I went to a good school and placed around median, but the other people who got this job tended to be near the top of the class and almost reliably from families of professionals.

Since stating this job, I‚Äôve continued to have impostor syndrome. I constantly am anxious about getting fired for the slightest errors or because I‚Äôm still adjusting to how things are done. I also feel like if I say ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know‚Äù in response to my boss‚Äôs question, even if it would be the truth, I would be found out to be a fraud. This leads me to try to guess the answer as though I know it confidently. When my boss asks follow-ups, I get flustered and eventually change my mind after looking into it further, and the boss ends up more confused because of my inconsistent premature responses. I‚Äôm trying to get used to how my boss asks questions, but I know some of the problem comes from within me.

Do you all have any advice or experience dealing with impostor syndrome? How do I teach myself that I‚Äôm qualified and am allowed to make mistakes/not know something? My coworkers/boss tell me I‚Äôm qualified and just need to stop being so nervous and anxious. I want to gain my confidence back."

Idk why but I had a feeling that was the day I would die. Idk how or why, but I keep getting strong Deja vu, and then frequent weaker Deja vu, like all the time. I feel like I‚Äôm crazy and now that the date approaches I keep thinking that I‚Äôll have more and more memories of the moments before I die. Im hoping that this is Anxiety related and that the date will come and pass, but I just have to talk to someone about this. Has anyone ever experienced anything similar?"
192zjte,Anxiety,2024-01-10,Why am i still so nervous,"I did a lot to combat my anxiety and i made good progress.

 I got a new simple part time job to help me get used to a stable routine again. Doesnt pay well but its mostly stressfree and i get along with my coworkers.

192zckf,Anxiety,2024-01-10,Anxiety in my body but not my head?,"Hi everyone! For the last few days, I‚Äôve been feeling like I can‚Äôt breathe properly (like someone is sitting on my chest) and I‚Äôve been noticing my heart racing constantly throughout the entire day. 

I had similar symptoms in September and went to the doctor to get checked out but turns out I was all fine. I think I was just very anxious waiting for some standardized test results to come back to me in September and my symptoms were a physical manifestation of that. 

The thing is, right now I don‚Äôt feel very anxious mentally, but all the physical symptoms are there. It‚Äôs like there‚Äôs some sort of disconnect in my brain and body that‚Äôs keeping me in fight or flight mode. Wondering if anyone else has felt like this and how they treated it? I‚Äôve been meditating and that helps a bit but I still am struggling to breathe and relax my heart rate as a perfectly healthy individual. I am a bit stressed waiting for my grad school decisions to come out, maybe my body is just way more stressed than my mind? 

If anyone else has experienced this, please send tips!"
192z8iv,Anxiety,2024-01-10,any advice for attachment anxiety?,"25 F with anxiety and depression. I‚Äôm not really sure whats going on with me, the past 5 days my anxiety has been making me feel so scared to be alone. the thing that seems to be triggering it lately is spending time with a specific friend, we will spend hours playing games and when he leaves i feel this pain in my chest, i start crying and have an anxiety attack because i don‚Äôt want him to go. i have no romantic feelings for him or anything, just an attachment. i feel crazy because i only met him a couple weeks ago and i have no reason to feel like this. i don‚Äôt know what to do, these sudden panic attacks and being afraid to be alone started a few months ago after a breakup and my psychiatrist gave me Lorazepam because i couldn‚Äôt eat or sleep, and i only take it when my anxiety is uncontrolled like right now. the random panic attacks stopped for a little over a month, and now this person seems to be a trigger for me in a way. i have so many things to do but i can‚Äôt focus on anything. i don‚Äôt have many friends and i was really happy to meet someone that i enjoyed spending time with but now i‚Äôm dealing with this. i‚Äôll be seeing my psychiatrist again in 3 weeks but if anyone has any advice for me until then, that would be super appreciated."
192z0hb,Anxiety,2024-01-10,DAE feel existential dread about ageing every birthday and new years?,"So this sounds silly, but every year around my (M23) birthday and new years day i've been knocked down by anxiety involving age. I understand now that this likely stems from things like percieved societal expectations and comparisons, but that doesn't stop me from dwelling on it!

Its nonsensical because it's something we have no control over and ultimately doesn't matter, plus i'm actually still really young in the grand scheme of things, but wow i hope i don't have to deal with it every birthday or time i reach an age milestone like 25, 30, 50 etc. I wanna enjoy my life and not focus on age but i can't help but feel insecure for not reaching certain marks in life soon enough, or just generally freaked out that i'm about to be in my mid 20s when it feels like i was 16 only last week.

I'm sure someone else on this sub knows what i mean."

For context, I‚Äôm a 21 year old female with no history of heart problems or major health issues in general. Just constipation and MAJOR anxiety, especially when it comes to my health.

192ywk4,Anxiety,2024-01-10,Warning! Need support,Don‚Äôt wanna scare anyone else with cardio anxiety but I just got back from my Cardiologist consultation and he said there was a cardiomyopathy on the EKG/ECG. He told me not to too much but I‚Äôm still kinda freaking out. He said I have a 1 in 10 chance if any at all of being at risk of sudden cardiac death or cardiac arrest but it‚Äôs still got me concerned. After months of having weird symptoms I‚Äôm honestly kinda glad in some ways to maybe finally know whats going on. Im doing an echo on Saturday and a stress test at the end of the month. Im currently lightheaded all the time and tired so much. I can barely eat or go on a walk either. Could really use some support. Best case scenario its Tokotsubos Cardiomyopathy which is completely reversible. On top of all this i‚Äôve been Diagnosed with IBD-Possible Chrons recently as well as a Strep B infection in my blood its all got me a mess lately and my anxiety has been through the roof. Im hoping for some good news in the coming weeks. Until then i‚Äôll try not to let every weird sensation freak me tf out. Best wishes to everyone:)
192yvif,Anxiety,2024-01-10,I‚Äôm anxious about to the GI doctor,"I (22F) went to my yearly appointment at my primary care doctor right before Christmas. I got my urine &amp; blood tested just to check on everything. 

Yesterday they called &amp; referred me to a GI specialist because my bilirubin levels were high. This is the second time my bilirubin levels have been high in a year so that‚Äôs why they referred me. 

I‚Äôm anxious to go because I don‚Äôt want to hear any bad news. I know I shouldn‚Äôt have but I googled what high bilirubin levels can indicate &amp; most of the answers scare me. Whenever I have health anxiety I overthink &amp; get scared that I‚Äôm dying. Then I start crying at the thought of me dying &amp; how sad all of my friends &amp; family would be. 

Overall, I‚Äôm trying to not worry about it until I know what‚Äôs causing it but every now &amp; then I get super anxious &amp; my thoughts just take off."
192yv0t,Anxiety,2024-01-10,What should I do?,"I've been diagnosed with OCD and I know I have maladaptive daydreaming, misophonia, and anxiety. 
Im 28m and I worked somewhere about 7 months ago and I have a stay to myself personality. On top of that I wanted to follow my religion and not unnecessarily talk to the girls or make eye contact/smile. I said hi and bye to everyone all the time even if they didn't say it to me. I would just do the work and clock out. 

That made some most of my coworkers upset. I was a dishwasher in a restaurant. One girl started to be very verbally abusive. When I would come to put the dishes after washing them and the baskets to the front, she would angrily sigh at me and turn her back. She even did that when I said you're welcome after i helped a customer get their uber eats order. When I tried talking to her at the end which I never should have HUGE mistake- never talk to people that are rude to you or ask them for help, try finding it somewhere else- so anyway I asked for her mop to mop the floor because I didn't have one. She let me use it and then as she was going somewhere, I said it's small meaning my area. Her abuse got to me that's why I spoke to her. she literally sighed angrily EVERYTIME I came that night, before she only did it sometimes. Then I was gonna give back her mop because someone gave me one and when I called her, she said what rudely and then just thanked the other boy and mocked me (because I just hi and bye thank you and you're welcome just talk about the work...). I ended up getting fired a week later because my attitude changed after that night.

So fast forward to now, I'm currently not working, my daddy gave me money. I just have some stuff going on that's why. I like to hangout in the Dunkin donuts near my house for hours. I'm definitely not gonna stay home all day! Okay here's the big surprise, that girl walks in for an interview. Before the interview, she saw me and gave me a cute smile. I just looked at her and then looked away. One thing to add is, she was nice to me that night only if we were alone. But when there were people around, she just wanted to humiliate me. She came in again today just to but kiss. The two times she came in, I had an anxiety attack. I'm not scared of her, but I don't know... The first one lasted for hours she was only in there for a few minutes. I had one again today and was even shaking. My chest had those anxious feelings. My eyes looked sad and my eyes got a little teary. Not a lot though it didn't feel like I was gonna cry at all.

If she gets the job, should I find a new hangout spot? I already have one in my mind, but I just really like this one. Or should I stay? Do you guys think this could be a chance to fight and improve my anxiety? Another big thing I want to add is like I said I have OCD and this has actually been my obsession for a while now! Rumination. Just going over it and over it from morning to night and feeling sad."

I can‚Äôt sleep, i can‚Äôt eat, and i cannot focus on anything other than their upcoming trip and it‚Äôs ruining me. Usually, if i have the day off when they leave i take a Benadryl and sleep the whole day or until they call me and tell me they‚Äôve gotten to their destination because if i stay awake i will cry until i throw up  and i just can‚Äôt live like this anymore- it‚Äôs genuinely so exhausting on top of the general anxiety i struggle with everyday. I haven‚Äôt talked to my therapist about this because i‚Äôve been dealing with so much that this is the last thing i thought about during our last session and i won‚Äôt see her until after their trip which is pretty useless :(. i just really needed to get this off of my chest because i can‚Äôt talk to my parents about it since i don‚Äôt want to scare them lol."

192ya8r,Anxiety,2024-01-10,Money anxiety. It‚Äôs so expensive to live.,"I‚Äôve very lucky that my husband is very supportive in every aspect possible. He has a great job, and he told me if I ever decided I didn‚Äôt want to work anymore, that we would be fine and he could support us. Sounds like a dream on my end, right?

Well I feel so guilty. I would never want to put all the pressure on my husband‚Äôs shoulders, so I work. I am currently in school to better my future career, so I currently don‚Äôt have my dream job at the moment. I‚Äôm just pushing through.

I find myself panicking about even the smallest but necessary purchases. I need new clothes, but anything that will last me a long time will cost $40+ dollars. I need my skincare because I ran out, but don‚Äôt want to spend nearly $100 at Sephora. I can‚Äôt use cheaper stuff because my skin will break out. 

I never ask my husband for money even though he offers it to me every now and then. I never take it. I feel so bad. The only exception is when he gives me money to go grocery shopping for the both of us. Even then I don‚Äôt spend every penny he gives me. 

I realize things could be a lot worse for us, and I realize I have a privilege that many people don‚Äôt have. I just can‚Äôt get over this anxiety that one day the money will be gone."
192y9cg,Anxiety,2024-01-10,Daughter can't choose anything at a restaurant.,"My Daughter has been diagnosed with anxiety. Recently we have been eating out a lot as we are on holiday.

I have also given her the choice of places to eat whithin reason as I won't be eating at KFC/ subway the entire holiday. 

I have also been encouraging her to order her own food as she struggles to talk to strangers and this is a basic skill we all need.

192xtpj,Anxiety,2024-01-10,Do I keep the job or focus on my mental health?,"I had never had anxiety before in my life. Maybe a little nervousness here and there but never anxiety. I had to get my gallbladder taken out two years ago because it was functioning at a 16% and I was so sick everyday I was losing an unhealthy amount of weight. After I got it out, I was sick all the time. I could barely eat and when I did try to eat foods they upset my stomach. This started my anxiety. I was so scared about leaving the house and not being near a bathroom because I constantly did not feel good. Since then I have gotten a lot of my stomach issues figured out but it still happens at least once a week when I get sick. But the anxiety never left. I was finishing up college dealing with these issues but I missed as many days as I needed when I didn‚Äôt feel good. During that time I worked as a doordash driver because of my busy schedule with school. This also allowed me to not have to drive/work when I didn‚Äôt feel good. 
After graduation I was having a very hard time finding a job. It took me around 6 months to get my first interview. I got the job as a probation officer and I was excited to finally have more income than I was getting as a part time doordash driver. The night after my first day I had a panic attack and didn‚Äôt feel in my right mind for at least a week after. I was already in not so good of a mindset (having anxiety everyday) and decided that maybe a job that stressful was not for me right now. (They told me it would take at least 6 months to get a full grip on the position). That left me without a job and having to move back to my hometown with my parents because I wanted to focus on myself and I knew I couldn‚Äôt keep supporting myself doordashing. 
I got an interview right away as a pe teacher at my old middle school. I figured this was the perfect position for me because there‚Äôs not too much stress and there‚Äôs a lot of time off involved with being a teacher. I had my first day today and started having an anxiety attack at school. I was tempted to go tell the boss I couldn‚Äôt do it and I needed to go home but we ended up getting evacuated and let go early anyway. Now I am having so much anxiety and not wanting to go back tomorrow. I know it seems so silly and simple to just go back but in my mind it‚Äôs a lot more work than that. It‚Äôs leaving my safety at home near a bathroom where I‚Äôm free to not feel good. (No one likes not feeling good in public). I guess what I‚Äôm trying to figure out, should I stick with the job and hope that my anxiety goes away once I‚Äôve been there for awhile or should I just focus on my mental health and maybe get on disability?"

192xpd7,Anxiety,2024-01-10,Heart anxiety?,"So a few months ago I went to the doctors to get a physical. Long story short, I really don‚Äôt like my doctor‚Äôs office.

Anyways, my friends are nurses and I‚Äôm scared of doctors as it is and they gave me the rundown on what to expect at a physical. (Touch your toes, check your eyes, ears, reflexes, etc.) and my doctor did none of that. She just checked my heart with a stethoscope. To add, I have really bad anxiety and I felt my heart beating really fast. So she told me that she heard an extra heartbeat and my heartbeat sounds very abnormal and was asking me if I ever get shortness of breath, chest pains, all that. I told her no. I run for half an hour no problem, I exercise, I eat healthy. She made me do an ekg and the nurse told me she always sense patients to the cardiologist. Ever since, I‚Äôve been having really bad anxiety with my heart. All those symptoms she asked me, I can‚Äôt even tell if I feel it or if it‚Äôs all in my head. Recently, my friend had checked me with her stethoscope for a good two minutes and she told me she didn‚Äôt hear anything unusual nor the third heartbeat the doctor said she heard.

I was told today that sombody would be staying back to train me working nights but I have been doing that and all I have been told is that I was doing a good job.

Sombody asked me today for help putting away stock and I help with the box and went back to what I was doing because I didn't see anymore and later saw her doing more.

When I went to leave yesterday I went to ask is there was anything else they needed and she just said nope I'm going home.

I can get up and leave but it‚Äôs really awkward doing it. 

My mind plays dirty tricks on me and I‚Äôm tired of it.

I feel my chest closing and I need to do stuff but I never found any mechanism to cope with uncertainty in general. While I understand that there are some activities I can do (and that I will certainly do!)

192w92z,Anxiety,2024-01-10,Panic attack from hearing two noises at once?,"Hi! I started getting panic attacks in late December. Common story y‚Äôall have heard 1 million times: first one had me thinking I needed to go to the hospital because I didn‚Äôt know what was happening, panicked even more because of that, ended up in a strong panic and adrenaline cycle etc. Took me a couple hours to get out of it. 

I‚Äôve had a few more since that first one, and I‚Äôve gotten better at managing them because 
I logically know what‚Äôs happening now and can kind of talk myself through it. 

I‚Äôve been trying to identify potential triggers. I know one is my father‚Ä¶just in general. So I do try to limit my direct contact with him. I thought alcohol might be inducing them, so I stopped drinking. But they‚Äôre still happening.

My last one occurred tonight and it was a weird scenario: I am visiting my parents. I was watching Jeopardy with my mom. In the next room, my father started watching the news loudly on his phone. Hearing two different shows, two distinct conversation threads happening at once made my brain just like‚Ä¶very unhappy. And the panic attack began. It was milder and shorter - only about 10-15 minutes total - but definitely present. This has also almost happened before when someone had the TV volume too loud. 

I‚Äôve always been sensitive to noise, but not to the point of literal panic. I also have no problem at places that are SUPPOSED to be loud - like crowded restaurants, concerts, or sports arenas.

Does anyone else have this? Should I be concerned about it seemingly getting worse or about this being related to something else?"

My strongest thesis at this stage that my medication has finally petered out after such a long window of use. - anyone here with the same experience? If so, what have you done going forward? 

My anxiety symptoms / experience is as follows: Initial panic episode which includes excruciating fear, terror, doom, hot flashes around my back, derealization, depersonalization, dizziness, slightly increases heart rate, numbness, gut and stomach issues. After initial episode, I have days or weeks of agoraphobia, severe depression (loss of pleasure in anything), loss of appetite, fatigue, fear, worry and relentless cycle of negative thoughts that all seem to ebb and flow. There seems to be a very long tailwind of the above symptoms after the initial attack that can last indefinitely or become worse with triggers. . 

Can anyone relate to this type of panic disorder? Also medication suddenly not working? And if so, how did you manage or what are your take aways? Would love to discuss."
192w3wc,Anxiety,2024-01-10,For the anxious AFAB and girlies,"Hellos to all, I (25f) am struggling. How do other folks with bodies that take hormonal birth control function? I have a lot of issues simply having my cycle because I struggle with the principle of having one (that‚Äôs another story lol). My issues are, any hormonal bc seems to raise my anxiety. I just started and stopped the nuva ring because of it. Taking hormonal contraception in general gives me anxiety because of the health risks and I‚Äôm so anxious about my health. Please anyone out there with any advice ?? I usually do continuous birth control, no placebo or off week. Should I just suck it up and do the off week? Has anyone noticed a drop in anxiety from that?

I take klonopin and it does help but I only get it once a day. I'm sick of this anxiety.  I have anxiety so bad that most the time I don't even realize that it's anxiety.  It comes out in anger and frustration.  I'm tired of feeling this way? Ant suggestions.  I've tried so many medications. Probably almost everything   maybe I'm missing something?

My heart has been looked over countless times with EKGs, ECGs, Xrays, Echos and even a catheter and they all say my hearts fine. But my brain keeps telling me I'm gonna have a heart attack or a stroke or something. I'm tired of wasting people's time at the ER, I also suffer from panic attacks which makes me think it's a heart attack and I've had a couple awkward ambulance rides to the hospital."

192vplh,Anxiety,2024-01-10,Not sure if I should see a cardiologist or not,"So I‚Äôve been pretty sedentary for about a year and a half. I was barely getting even 1000 steps daily. I put 30 pounds on in like 4-5 months ( a little concerned about that as well). 

I‚Äôm wondering if my heart rate is normal or not. 

So my resting HR is usually anywhere from 70-90. If I‚Äôm standing it‚Äôs usually 102-108 doesn‚Äôt seem to go below 100 (I don‚Äôt like that). I‚Äôve recently started waking on my walking pad because I‚Äôm trying to lose weight. Walking at a speed of 3 my heart rate can hit 144 and it will stay at that until I stop. If I go a slower speed my heart rate can be like 125ish. 

But my heart rate goes up extremely easy. If I get out of bed it‚Äôll shoot up 30 beats. If I walk up stairs it‚Äôll jump a ton. If I lift heavy things my heart rate can hit as high as 180 (which is extremely uncomfortable). 

I don‚Äôt know if this is normal since I‚Äôve been so sedentary or if I should look more into this. I just want to be healthy again and lose weight and live my life. I‚Äôm not going to stop exercising because of this, I just want to know if it‚Äôs okay for me to exercise and if exercise will help lower my rate. My resting rate seems to be fine, but my standing rate and exercise rate seem to be a little high."

I did a sleep study and it turned out I'm perfectly fine. Went to my GP to tell him this (haven't seen him in a while). HE WAS 100% CERTAIN I have severe anxiety. He asked ""do you ever have a need to cry?x 'I told him I'm not sure but I do feel empty a lot of the time, especially at work"". He gave me some herb pills now and it did calm me down just a little. Apparently they don't work all the time cause I just woke up now at 2am with again pounding heartbeats.

192v2ii,Anxiety,2024-01-10,Anxiety and stomach issues are making me depressed,"I had plans to see my boyfriend today, but I had an episode of severe stomach cramps and diarrhoea last night from 1am to 4am. I woke up feeling better, but my sore stomach was still there. It felt like my stomach acid was burning through to my skin.

I got ready as fast as I could when I woke up (8am) to catch the bus at 9:30am, but when I got ready in time and started thinking of catching the bus I got the wave of stomach cramps again and missed the bus by sitting on the toilet. I felt so fucking guilty.

I told myself I'd catch the next bus at 10:55am, which I got ready for, and 5 minutes before the bus came again I got hit with needing to shit again, which made me miss the same bus a second time. I sat on the floor and started crying, and I still am. I live in Australia and this is one of the first good days its been this whole holidays, as its been raining and storming almost every other day. Today was the most perfect day to go outside and see him and I was too much of a pussy to force myself to get on that bus. 

Now that I'm sitting here, regretting my choices of just standing still knowing I could've ran 2 minutes down the road to catch the bus, feeling less sick and my stomach is miraculously feeling better. This shit is so annoying to the point that I can't even go outside anymore or simply THINK about going outside without feeling intense stomach cramps and nausea. I get that I was unwell last night but oh my god, I seriously can't help but cry my eyes out knowing I could've seen him (when I've been waiting all week super excited) and I just threw it away because of a simple need to shit. 

He wants to understand, but I don't think he can and it makes me feel so bad. I feel so bad promising him and talking to him a couple days before that we're gonna have so much fun only for me to miss the bus TWICE all because I get stuck on the toilet.

I don't deserve this shit and neither does my friends or my boyfriend or my family always keeping up with my problems. I always cancel plans last minute because of my anxiety, stress and lowkey depression and stomach issues and I feel the only thing I deserve is to feel more pain. Why should I feel good when everything I eat puts me in immense pain, and when I want to go out and be healthy and enjoy the lovely weather that I get cursed with this shit? 

It's not every day where I'm able to go out and do what I want. Theres two or so weeks left of the school holidays and I'm throwing it away by fucking sitting here, crying over missing my bus twice and feeling so sick. I want to genuinely just be able to see my friends and my boyfriend without the fear of me throwing up, shitting myself or crying. "
192v1oe,Anxiety,2024-01-10,I haven‚Äôt been able to even touch my tension issues for 6 years and they‚Äôre destroying me.

I need something that can help. Benzos, muscle relaxers, nerve blockers, and Botox does nothing. Help. Me. This is horrific. I need help.

192uwe9,Anxiety,2024-01-10,Tell me how to care less about what people think?,"Sorry, this might be long. I struggle a lot with what people think of me, but for whatever reason, I have even more anxiety about how people view my loved ones. My parents own two local businesses, I manage both of them, so I see my parents everyday. Between both businesses, we have about 50 employees. All of which know me of course, as well my parents. I LOVE my parents and think the world of them. They are the hardest working people I know and are so giving and caring. I know I am their daughter and am biased, but I have people come up to me left and right telling me what amazing parents I have. I am very proud to be their daughter. But, there will always problematic people out there, and some of them end of being our employees. I could give a million stories, but in general, I have a lot of anxiety when it comes to people straight up lying about situations that have never happened. Since I am the manager, I am often in the room when my parents handle problems with employees. So I am always aware of the problem, as well as what was communicated between both parties. My parents are very calm and understanding people. I have seen employees do some of the most crazy, disrespectful things, and never have my parents raised their voice, call them out in front of others, etc. they always handle it privately and professionally. I will then be walking in a hallway to hear ‚Äúsaid employee‚Äù telling their coworkers the most wild, outlandish, lie I have ever heard. I will always go stand up for my parents in these situations, but it keeps me up at night wondering how many stories there are out there of my parents that I haven‚Äôt happened to overhear that simply never happened? I have this large fear of someone thinking my parents are terrible people based on something that wasn‚Äôt true. How do I work through this? I am a 23 year old female and my parents are both 45."
192umpv,Anxiety,2024-01-10,My boss said the smell of my lunch lingers and now it's just going around and around in my brain...,"I don't know if this is the right place for this or not; please let me know and I will remove it, or I won't be offended if it is removed and someone points me in the right direction.

Quick-quick overview: Female, married, grown children (moved out), mid-fifties, job, had anxiety at some level my entire life.

I work in an office in a one-story building, which is about 9,000 square feet US. We have a head boss, an assistant boss, me (Administrative Assistant to the head boss), a custodian, and a handful of other employees who drift in and out. Not a big operation, but we specialize. Head Boss (HB), Assistant Boss (AB) and me work in an office area about 1,500 square feet. We each have our own office, and there is a separate conference room/break room with a microwave, coffee grinder and coffee pot, mini-fridge, and conference table. I usually eat my lunch at my desk, by personal preference. I also usually work through lunch, also by personal preference.

I have several food allergies and intolerances, so it is very difficult for me to just grab lunch at a restaurant. On days I work, I also tend to make lunch my meal of the day, and have just a light supper (or skip it altogether). Therefore, I normally make my lunch and bring it in. It is usually something I can heat up in the microwave; a gluten free chicken pot pie, a bowl of vegetable soup, a bowl of gluten-free spaghetti, a package of pre-made gluten free chicken fettuccini alfredo. In the summer I often do gluten free sandwiches or salad with a piece of chicken breast that I've heated up in the microwave. So far, none of this has been a problem...or so I thought.

I spent a good part of today out of the office, at another part of our campus. I'd heated up a little cup of microwave oatmeal [(this oatmeal cup)](https://www.bobsredmill.com/shop/oats/gluten-free-brown-sugar-and-maple-oatmeal-cup.html) and was able to scarf that down before I had a meeting and then had to leave at about 11 AM, but I worked through lunch. I didn't get back to the office until about 3:45 and I'd not only had no lunch but no coffee. I'd brought a bowl of homemade Vegetable Beef Soup and gluten free crackers for lunch, and some chocolate pudding cups to keep in my desk for desserts. That bowl of soup sounded like the absolute tastiest thing in the world right then because I was **STARVING**.

I knew that HB was going to be having a group meeting in the conference room with AB and the other floater employees at 4:30. I just wanted to make my coffee, heat up my soup, and hide in my office. I mentioned how hungry I was to HB. He said, and this is pretty much a quote, ""Could you heat up your food in \[custodian's\] microwave? Your food has a very definite strong smell. It lingers.""

The custodian's area is all the way on the other side of the building from us. I really didn't want to carry a bowl of hot soup from one side of the building to the other. Plus, I was all of a sudden just hit with...the smell lingers? It *lingers?* Does it smell *bad?* Is it a *terrible* smell? Does it smell *gross?* Has it been smelling gross and lingering *the entire four years I've worked here and nobody has told me??? WHAT DOES HE MEAN, THE SMELL LINGERS??? OMG, I'M GROSSING OUT MY BOSS!!!*

I just stood there. I didn't know what to do. I finally just stuttered something like, ""Uh, okay, sorry,"" and went into my office and tried not to cry. (Failed, but at least it was quiet.) I already had my coffee, but I was still hungry. I finally just ate a pudding cup and some of the crackers that I brought to eat with my soup. I was so looking forward to that soup; I made it myself and it is good soup, but now I don't even care about it.

I understand that HB didn't want food odors hanging around while he was trying to have his meeting. They do close the door of the conference room and whatever smells are in there are just trapped there. I get it. And HB really isn't a jerk, even though I may have painted him as one; he's actually a very nice guy who gave me a chance at a job when nobody else would. I'm very grateful to him and I like him very much. He's just one of those people who are very blunt, and he doesn't think about how he could say something nicely or if what he is saying could be misconstrued. It literally doesn't occur to him that someone could take offense to things he says, because to him he is just saying a true fact. I'm sure he just meant that he didn't want a food odor cloud hanging out with them in their meeting.

But...it just hit me like a brick, and I have been so upset ever since. Everyone has now left the office and I'm still here, crying because I'm afraid my food has been stinking up the place and nobody told me, and now I'm afraid to even bring in anything to eat that needs to be heated up. Like I said, I can't just go to McDonald's or Arby's or wherever and grab food that's already cooked for me.

In fact, I've gotten myself so worked up that I feel myself getting sleepy, which always happens when I am overstimulated emotionally (I think I'm somewhat narcoleptic). The doctor gave me Buspirone 5 mg to take when I feel overwhelmed, but it doesn't seem to be doing much. And I feel nauseous, which is probably the coffee on an empty stomach. I need to eat lunch at work tomorrow. I don't know if I can do it!"
192umdw,Anxiety,2024-01-10,The feeling of empowerment I get after making a phone call,"I have phone anxiety, specifically for people I am not close with. I chose a field of work where I very rarely have to make phone calls as a result. However, on the odd occasion I do have to call clients if no one else is able to do so.

There‚Äôs something about the feeling I get after I do make a successful phone call (which is most of the time now that I have more experience and know what to say). I feel empowered and that I could accomplish anything in that moment. I feel proud of myself. My best days are where I have to make a phone call first thing because I am on a high for the rest of the day. Though I could just feel happier knowing I don‚Äôt need to make any more for the day‚Ä¶

However, no matter how strong this positive feeling is, I still struggle with the anticipation before every call.

Anyone else feel the same?"

192tmqo,Anxiety,2024-01-09,Does anyone else feel ashamed of having anxiety?,"What the title says. I don't tell people in my life I have it, only real close family and friends. I'm scared people someday will know I'm like this. I try my best to hide when I feel anxious or uncomfortable and try to act normal. It's more dificult when I'm having a full panic attack and that make me don't wanna have that much social interactions because I fear having a panic attack and scare the other people. When I'm having a panic attack all I can think about is ""I'm gonna die"" and ""Everybody will think I'm crazy"". My terapist said having anxiety is not that rare, a lot of people have it, is normal, no one will judge, but she doesn't have it how would she know?

Context: throughout my degree and jobs as a researcher and teacher, I (F25) have had paralysing perfectionist anxiety. I‚Äôm exhausted."
192tjqm,Anxiety,2024-01-09,Is this just my health anxiety flaring ?,"New symptoms I‚Äôm dealing with the last two weeks.

Perceived sensitivity (I‚Äôll touch the top of my head or the back of my neck or top of forearm near elbow and I‚Äôll immediately spiral into panic and obsessive touching because it feels ‚Äúoff‚Äù or maybe like it has ‚Äúreduced sensitivity‚Äù. I will then touch the same spot a few hours later and it feels like the sensitivity has been restored. Idk. 

Twitching, especially my feet. More than usual. 

Internal vibrations, which feel like I have a buzzing or vibrating sensation in my legs and chest. It‚Äôs not something you can see outside of my body. 

Increased tinnitus, which has really sucked. 

Talking at night feels almost like a chore when I‚Äôm tired, like my tongue has to work extra hard and I‚Äôll find myself obsessing about it until I start to stutter or trip up over words.




Could this all be from my hyperawarness/OCD/health anxiety?


BTW-

Here are the symptoms I‚Äôve also had the last 3 months - all of these started when my pinched nerve started, I‚Äôm a pro guitarist so I‚Äôve been on high alert anxiety every day for the last 18 weeks as my pinched nerve slowly l heals 

* My daily anxiety revolves around MS, Stroke, Parkinson‚Äôs, heart attack or fear of going deaf. - I have gotten a neck mri without contrast, ct scans, EMG, etc.- I am getting a brain mri with contrast but I‚Äôm assuming it‚Äôll be negative.
 
* Weird sensation back of throat after waking up with dry mouth

* Tingling limbs like they‚Äôre falling asleep or like they‚Äôre fizzing underneath my skin (for a week now starting when I started getting sick)

* Fear of swallowing

* The two weeks of hyperaucisis and ear wobbling 

* Fear of becoming schizophrenic 


* Tingling all over body (my cervical radiculopathy hand tingles cuz of the pinched nerve but that‚Äôs a totally different sensation of tingling, that‚Äôs more intense and triggered by movements)


* Perceived sensation of slurring or messing up words, but everyone says I sound normal

* Feeling like I can‚Äôt breath and am having a heart attack

* Derealization


* Constantly testing my voice, recording myself talking 


* Colder than normal, I‚Äôm usually always running way too hot and need AC on even in winter - but I‚Äôve also lost like 70 lbs this year. 


* Lowered appetite 


* Can‚Äôt sleep - I wake up after 2-3 hours every night so I sleep in blocks 


* Left side of tongue and left corner of mouth tingles sometimes 

* Worry that my hands are losing dexterity and strength so I‚Äôll test them by catching things or squeezing things


* Always testing heart rate with a finger device


* Intense depressive episodes lasting a few hours where I feel hopeless 


* Waking up with one eye blurry and irritated and dry , lasts a few hours and happens every few weeks/started 2 months ago


* Obsessed about the eye that gets blurry sometimes, I‚Äôll film both eyes to test that they close and open at same time 


* Always testing my hearing (I have a disease of the ears, but it‚Äôs still way too much and too obsessive)


* Daily rumination of death and non existence which gives me incredible


* Fear of taking pills or new medication because I‚Äôm worried it‚Äôll cause horrendous side effects 


* Dry mouth"

192t6uz,Anxiety,2024-01-09,Quit my job for my mental health but now worried about money,"Quit my job, but worried about money.

I had to do something very hard today. I had to quit my job. It was not a decision I took lightly. Unfortunately it was my first real job and it was sponsored by vocational rehab, which makes me feel bad about quitting. However, I need to prioritize my mental health. I am a 25 year old individual living with multiple disabilities including type 1 diabetes, adhd and anxiety. The job was causing me a lot of stress and anxiety. I spent 4 hours at the therapy office yesterday. They are also adjusting my anxiety medication, I‚Äôm still testing adhd meds. I would like to work but I‚Äôm not sure what I want to do. Sitting around and collecting disability is not an option. There has to be something im good at. Both my boss and vocational rehab are proud of me for prioritizing my mental health. However, I am still worried about money, despite the fact that I live with my parents. If I don‚Äôt work, I won‚Äôt be able to have an income. Money is a big stressor in my life. And I‚Äôm also trying to not feel like a failure. Maybe I can craft or sell something on etsy. Or freelance/gig work. There has to be something I‚Äôm good at. I‚Äôm just not sure what. My plan for now is to priorize my mental health, and I asked my therapy office if I was able to come in twice a week so we shall see what they say. I‚Äôm probably not the first one to quit my job due to stress. But I‚Äôm afraid I‚Äôm

192p44u,Anxiety,2024-01-09,My parents don't think anxiety is real and don't support meds,"

I'm a 21 year old and I stuggle with decently bad anxiety. I never used to have any type of anxiety and in fact was one of those people that didn't really beleive/understand it at all. About three or so years ago my family completely relocated and went from NJ to NC. I had no friends and my relationship eventually ended due to long distance struggles. Me being 18 at the time I couldn't afford to stay in NJ so I was basically forced to move with my parents. The first year or so I hated it and I worked through it and still was able to work and provide for myself. After about a year I ended up in the emergency room six times in two weeks due to panic attacks and me having no idea what's happening. I've since been diagnosed with anxiety but I don't want to take meds. I've been trying for about a year now to deal with it without meds but it's getting to the point where functioning normally is a struggle. I get up to was the dishes and have anxiety attacks and feel like I can't breathe. I go out with my current partner and can't even bring myself to go into the building to eat. Many people around me tell me I should seek help or medication but I'm honestly terrified. My parents are both 60+ years of age and old fashioned and don't really think anciety exists. My sister's have fucked up on drugs before and I'm the only kid who hasn't. I brought the idea of potential medication to my mom and she just shut it down saying ""any excuse for you to not work"". I'm in between a rock and a hard spot because I don't want to dissapoint my parents by taking these meds they don't support. But on the other hand the reason I can't keep a job or function is because of my anxiety. I feel weak even saying this lol because I want to work. I want to function normally. I'm just not sure how to go about that. The main question is , how do I go about this? Do I just try and figure this out on my own or is medication the best option for me? Because where I stand right now it seems like either way I'm a dissapointment to my parents."

192sf2e,Anxiety,2024-01-09,Why am I like this?,"Quick background info: I'm 32. 15-ish yrs ago, my good friend and I loved to play Red Dead Redeption, Minecraft, COD, and a bunch of other games. A few years later, as I got older and moved to college, I stopped gaming. I was never hard-core into it, but back then, it had been nice.

Fast forward to me now. I started up RDR2 again a few month ago and have now just spent my time doing random RDR2 things, since I've completed the story. It makes me happy and focused when I play, but I have to be in the mood to play.

My boyfriend has tried to show me other games--Elden Ring, Dark Souls games, 2-player partner games, etc--but I can't get into them and have zero interest in asking if he wants to play them.

His best friend has started playing Minecraft together with his wife and my boyfriend asked me if I wanted to try that. I said I was interested, made my character (my favorite part) last night with him, and then we didn't play. I said I was getting tired, which was true, but I just didn't want to play. So I said we could play tomorrow (which is today).

I've been anxious over it all day, and even took a nap to kill time. I do that frequently when I'm feeling extra depressed or worked up. Idk if it's a routine thing that is preventing me from wanting to play Minecraft. It seems so trivial, but then why am I struggling so hard and why do I want to cry?

I don't want my boyfriend to be upset with me. I want to want to play with him and build us a cool house where I can be a farmer, but I simply cannot bring myself to show any interest.

This kind of situation has prevented me from doing things and ""going out of my comfort zone"" in the past. What's wrong with me?"

And now ever since I‚Äôve graduated high school (5 years ago now) I‚Äôve had a harder and harder time commiting to a full time job.  

I was staying at my job from high school, but then I had to leave due to society and family pressuring me.  Every job I‚Äôve tried since then I‚Äôve gotten fired at or I just give up on.  All because I‚Äôm afraid of change and committing to something unfamiliar.  I don‚Äôt know why but I get filled with this huge sense of dread that my ‚Äúold‚Äù life will be over even though I know that‚Äôs not true and it‚Äôs stupid to think that.

After sitting down again I looked at my hand and it was shaking. Not a light shaking that you could compare to vibrating. It was really strong. I'm just glad it started after going back to my desk, I don't think I could ever go to that class again if I started shaking while writing something on the board.

I have that, but my brain is still wired, I‚Äôm somehow mentally alert, when I‚Äôm in bed my eyes don‚Äôt feel tired and my brain feels frustratingly awake and fresh.  The rest of me wants to sleep.

On top of that, because of the anxiety, I keep thinking ‚Äúwhat if there‚Äôs a brain tumor keeping me awake‚Äù?  Like, obviously not, my sleep schedule was off from the holidays in conjunction with taking a stimulant, I know it‚Äôs that but I keep thinking ‚Äúwhat if‚Äù?

After I graduated the doc that we get prescriptions from was impressed with how much I had improved so he let me wean off them.   Little did we know

Half a year later I became severely depressed and lost the ability to think or talk.  Sad empty feeling. Then I got sent to a second referral just to be told to go back on them. Lol. 

I still hate the idea of taking a capsule everyday forever like a dependency.   Every doctor I have asked if I can get off them again has said no suggested ‚ÄúNo. do you want to go back to where you were back then?‚Äù

But I did have my first panic attack around last year near at the end of November and my anxiety was just awful and body was in panic mode(though I never had another panic attack).

But I did experience for awhile that when I laid in bed my legs would start shaking like I was cold which would sometimes move up my body.And my heart would start pounding which I would hear in my ear and my tinnitus in my left wear would get significantly louder which caused me to freak out and had to have my mom sleep with me every time it happened.

 This persisted for a while and calmed down  until the near end of December and finally went away completely by December 31st.

But I guess my body got so used to stress that I‚Äôve been experiencing really bad anxiety symptoms(like heart palpitations,  dissociation,depersonalization,dizziness,etc) but those things don‚Äôt actually bother me or interfere with my life like it does for some people since I‚Äôve always dealt with those things and kind of gotten used to how to manage them that when they do happen they just go away.

But one in particular has just made me miserable and it usually only happen at night when I lay down and it‚Äôs a sort of vibrating/buzzing feeling only in my chest area and it gets really bad when I lay down(especially laying on my left side) and sometimes moves around just my chest area but also goes down a little above the stomach area. It always happens when I either just to lay down or to sleep and doesn‚Äôt go away until I fall asleep. 
It‚Äôs been pretty bad the past two days and has seeped into continuing during the day.

Has anyone experienced this and if so what have you done or did to either help manage it  or make it go away completely so that it‚Äôs  not so uncomfortable and sometimes a little painful?

Also sometimes other anxiety symptoms mix with it making it scarier. I try not to think about it but it‚Äôs so difficult. 

I‚Äôve tried meditation, breathe works, but because of the buzzing it doesn‚Äôt help at all.

I‚Äôm not a hypochondriac by any means but because of this unknown feeling my anxiety always convinces me I‚Äôm gonna have a heart attack.

I was given Hydroxazine by my doctor as a temporary solution/treatment for anxiety but it hasn‚Äôt really helped at all like it seems to have done for some people.

I was recommended by my dad since he suffers from panic attacks to take  Ashwagandha(more specifically the Goli gummies)to see if that helps? 

I‚Äôve already went ahead a purchased some and I took only one gummy(150mg) last night an hour before I went to bed just to try it although the bottle recommends 2gummies(300mg) which I‚Äôll do tonight.

I don‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôve gone a single day without experiencing some type of anxiousness. It gets to the point that my anxiety gets to be obsessive. Especially with obsessive anxious thinking. 

For about 5 months now I been dealing with the biggest depressive/anxious episodes of my life. I feel so incredibly drained and always on edge. The reason for this is that my dad has started to act out like he did in my childhood. I have a covert narcissist father and during my childhood he caused me a lot of trauma. I won‚Äôt get into it because a lot of it is extremely triggering but to say the least it was bad and very repetitive. His behavior has left a big impact on my life and he refuses to take accountability for his actions. 

The past 5 months he has been repeating this behavior and it has honestly put me into fight or flight mode. It has been incredibly exhausting but I honestly feel so anxious all of the time and also very agitated. I have gone from healing myself to falling right back to where I was before if not worse.

Need Opinion / Advice / Suggestion...

This might be wrong forum but i m taking the risk. I (31F) had a long suspicion that I may be on some / low spectrum of ADHD. I did a few online tests which told me I do have ADHD but I didn't purchase the whole diagnosis so again I am not completely sure about this. I have anxiety and do feel depressed sometimes which I thought might be because of ADHD (I might be wrong). I took the official ADHD test after my therapist suggested it, but while going through the test I felt that not all the questions were relatable for me. Like I am super detail-oriented but then again I like structured things, same pattern stuff, and I am not able to focus nowadays. I feel I am at a total loss here as I don't know how to go ahead after this. My therapist is suggesting to start Anti-anxiety and Anti-depressants but I am not sure about this.

So lately I‚Äôve been experiencing a very strange sensation and I wanted to hear if people could relate. 

The last few weeks at random times I‚Äôve been experiencing what I can only describe as a cross between a tingle/crawling/static feeling particularly in my hands, face and scalp and on occasion it feels like it covers my body. It‚Äôll last anywhere from a few minutes to an hour or so and comes and goes at will, there isn‚Äôt really a trigger. 

It sort of feels like when you get very low grade pins and needles or come in from the cold and you can feel the tingle on your skin. 

It doesn‚Äôt cause me any pain or real discomfort it‚Äôs just noticeable and a little unpleasant to experience. I‚Äôve definitely had an increase in anxiety the last few weeks so I‚Äôm trying to rationalise it as that but my good old brain is trying to convince me it‚Äôs worse.

Now I'm overweight, dread going outside and everything in my body hurts. The transformation happened very quickly since 2019 and I haven't acclimated to my new reality where I wake up with dread every day. 


If I do go outside or attend a social gathering, I'm constantly met with people who are shocked and will ask ""what happened to you?"", because my hair, face, eyes and body are no longer what they used to be. 

I worked out, did yoga thrive a week, lifted weights, but the weight comes back when I stop spending 20 hours in the gym every week. 

My diet is clean but I can't seem to fix my situation with just diet or exercise. Therapists have told me that my coping mechanisms are healthy so I have no recourse over there.

I got on anxiety medicine that‚Äôs actually working. Cymbalta. I feel, for the first time in my life, what it‚Äôs like to live without anxiety. Or mostly. I still have some but nothing like what it was. And I realize that it has literally been with me for my entire life. Since I was a child. All of my childhood behaviors that were so weird and unexplainable even to me, suddenly make sense in the context of anxiety. Nobody bothered to diagnose me with anything back in the 80‚Äôs. I was just a problem child. I had behavioral issues. I lashed out. I couldn‚Äôt control my emotions. No emotional regulation at all. Probably ADHD. No diagnosis on that either. Nobody cared to determine why I was the way I was, they just disciplined me which made my anxiety worse. I was labeled weird  and a crybaby. I‚Äôm probably neurodivergent but, again, nobody bothered to find out. And I‚Äôm having to figure out my own brain in my 40‚Äôs.  

I decided I‚Äôm not going to let anxiety rule me anymore. I lost my whole life to it. I refuse to lose the rest of my life to it. I‚Äôm going to go out and do more things. I love rock and metal concerts so I‚Äôm going to go to more. I‚Äôm so mad that not one person in my life when I was a kid thought to figure out what was going on with my behavior.

I have chest pains, shortness of breath, my heart hurts, I have knots in my stomach, racing thoughts and it feels like my stomach is in my throat. Normally I could do breathing exercises or try to calm myself other ways - but this time none of that works. It‚Äôs just a persistent, anxiety attack feeling. I wake up with it and go to sleep with it. I‚Äôm now worried I‚Äôm wrecking my heart because I can‚Äôt seem to get ahold of my anxiety. So I‚Äôm also giving myself anxiety about having anxiety‚Ä¶. It‚Äôs not a great time. 
Has anyone experienced this? Or can give recommendations on what helped them? Thanks in advance!"
192n7a8,Anxiety,2024-01-09,Anxiety,"Anxiety comes and goes for me. Sometimes it accentuates because of some baseline happiness or nitpicky mood swings. But, it was always there. Sometimes its so bad that I would question my place in this world. Sometimes I would drink a lot. Sometimes I would engage in self harm. There was a point that I wanted to die, but, decided that the pain wouldn't stop after death than what I feel now so I decided to claw up and try and live life. Life had these fleeting spots of beauty and I decided to focus on that. I still do. It's hard to do but it's so worth it. That bit of love and beauty is precious. I was aggressive in changing my perception and at 41, am still being aggressive but I can now control the pains in my body and my mind. I try and think of life in it's most vulnerable moment or love in the same way. 

I take vitamins to deal with my anxiety and also practice mindfulness and mediation. My mind does not control me, I control it. I understand it's a bit of separation but when the mind and body come together, it's utopia."
192meee,Anxiety,2024-01-09,Anxiety induced workaholism and over productivity,"I feel like I‚Äôm in a constant cycle of overworking to the point of burnt out and serious illness then telling myself that I‚Äôm going to change and stop this madness only to fall back into the same hole of despair. All last year I was filling my calendar with never ending tasks, applying to jobs, reading, taking on new hobbies. It was fine though because I was going to therapy which would mean that really I was doing fine, or so I would tell myself. I crashed in December. Became seriously sick and no amount of taking it easy, slow or looking after myself was working. I am still sick writing this. I‚Äôm so worried all the time, and so terrified and in pain. Being preoccupied means that I don‚Äôt have a minute to stop and think about everything that brings me pain.everything is fine as long as I‚Äôm doing 12hr+ days studying full time, applying to jobs, working out, doing multiple hobbies. On the outside, all seems to be fine, but inside I feel like I‚Äôm constantly trying to keep it together and I am seriously terrified of losing control."
192lz1h,Anxiety,2024-01-09,Anyone else have similar physical symptoms,"I know that the Internet for medical advice is not trust worthy. I tried calling my general physician with these symptoms and she told me ""it's just anxiety take a valium"". Well, my valium wore off.

In the beginning of November/end of October, I statt3d experiencing heightened anxiety. I've been experiencing these symptoms for about two months. In started with difficulty swallowing water or more watery fruits like grapes or oranges. I would often choke on water. Then I began feeling tightness in my throat. 

Around that time I had a flu, so I'm not sure what is flu symptoms or anxiety.

Awful acid reflux appeared. I read that if you have reflux or GERD it's entirely possible to feel tightness in the throat or to have difficulty swallowing. 

I continue to have these symptoms. I feel as if my throat is narrowing at the bottom and as If I costantly have something in stuck in my throat and as If I have to constantly cough or clear my throat. 

The symptoms worsen in the evening and at night. 

My mom used to have similar difficulty swallowing and throat tightness, when she experienced a very stressful period in her life. 

The symptoms do seem to worse when I panic about the symptoms. 

I just need to know is it possible all this to be from anxiety or should I get myself checked out?"

192l6sj,Anxiety,2024-01-09,Coffee helps my anxiety,"I always wake up with a certain amount of existential dread. Heart pounding, physical anxiety where I feel exhausted despite having just woken up from sleeping for eleven hours. 

Coffee doesn't just give me energy, it also undoubtedly soothes this anxiety; I can come off the verge of a panic attack after a cup. I don't really understand this, as for many people, caffeine seems to do the exact opposite. I've been drinking at least three cups a day due to this, like a form of self medication, and even on days where I exceed this, I never face consequence for it. 

Does anyone have a possible explanation?"
192l0ex,Anxiety,2024-01-09,Helping wife through anxiety and possible panic disorder,"So my wife has always been anxious - known her for some 15 years now. She had some panic and anxiety periods 9 years ago due to being waked up every 15 minutes by our first child for some weeks. She got through it and didnt have panic attacks since. 

However, work related stress has now triggered some very serious symptoms (constant anxiety, GAD, no sleep and constant panic attacks). We just got her on a benzo for the panic attacks and she will take sleeping pills for some time.

We are in good hands with competent doctors and phychologists amd lots of support, but right now it feels very dark. She will start sertralin in a couple of days.

Im off work to take care of her and my dad takes care of our whole family (shopping cooking etc).

Are we doing the right things?

What do you think will come off this? She didnt have panic attacks for 9 years - do people return to ""normal"" after such episodes?"

192jr33,Anxiety,2024-01-09,feels like im going crazy sometimes,"every day, sometimes due to my circumstances or just from anxiety alone, i break out into panic attacks. this happens multiple times a day. it happens so often it is giving me mental fatigue, headaches, and its starting to make me feel crazy.  my panic attacks used to be pretty standard but i have become so depressed that just about anything will trigger my crying bouts (that lead to panic attacks usually), or alternatively panic attacks that lead to crying bouts. i had a panic attack before bed, i had one this morning, and lately as i look around the room i start to feel like im going crazy. nothing grounds me, nothing is helping, and im looking up at the sky for answers. i know im probably not going crazy, but it makes me wonder what this repeated cycle and stress is doing to me. i feel like im going to lose it most days. does anyone else feel this way?
not sure if important to mention but i also have been dissociating more lately which honestly isnt so bad because i think its my brains way of coping under the stress. it happened a lot growing up but not so much for awhile , until just lately"
192jja6,Anxiety,2024-01-09,Why doesn't this go away? Am I having a heart attack??,"So I've been getting weird flairs that make me feel super anxious, nauseated and also raises my heart rate very quick, like turning a switch or something.
Today I was at work,  attending a meeting when sudden wave of weird tingle like tension or a flush goes through my veins and I sort of feel like my veins tense up?? 

My hr jumped from 70 to 110bpm while sitting still and it started to bounce around 105-130bpm without doing anything. Of course that led to an awful feeling in my body and mind started to go like ""oh fuck, I've had this before but this time it must be a heart attack!!!"". I felt the strange flushing feeling in my veins and around my body while my hr just stayed high. 

Tried breathing exercises, talking myself out of it etc. Nothing worked. I took some propral and benzos and only then managed to get hr under 100bpm after an hour of feeling terrible, fainty and dizzy , still also panicking and feeling very anxious. I've continued to feel anxious and had my heart rate in the 90-105 zone after two 40mg propral and opamox 30mg and it's been 12 hours.

My face and ears feel tingly and hot and I still feel nauseated and tired. Is this typical for an anxiety attack to stuck like this and not go away? What kind of tricks should I try? 

I have been to the ER couple of times before when I felt similar, but they couldn't find anything wrong"

192j1p5,Anxiety,2024-01-09,A little update on medication and trying to get pregabalin,"I posted in December about being denied pregabalin by the GP because I'm child bearing age, so I sent an econsult and told them how much I don't want kids. They gave me an appointment for today (3 week wait) and I thought it was with a different doctor but it turned out to be a nurse. I don't mean to be rude to nurses but I don't see the point in speaking to them about mental health medication when they can't prescribe anything. Anyway, she had to go off and ask the doctor as she couldn't do anything. The doctor comes back saying to refer me to psychiatry. So I'm not being prescribed anything for now and I have to wait an unknown amount of time. 

In the mean time, I've been thinking more about whether pregabalin is even a good idea. I've read about it wearing off after a while and stopping working. Also idk if I'm comfortable taking a class C drug, it'll be annoying when traveling. But if I don't go on it, I'm not sure what my options are at this point. I feel like I've tried everything.

I'm on sertraline which helps but not enough. Others that I've tried and failed: fluoxotine, citalopram, propranolol, quertiapine, buspar, mirtazapine (the worst of them all). 

Feeling like ill never find something to help and I'll forever have my life dictated by anxiety. 

BTW I have been in therapy for years, doing EMDR. Done CBT. Tried meditation, yoga, breathing, all that at home. Doesn't help when I'm in total panic."

Is this common?"
192it9m,Anxiety,2024-01-09,Weird anxiety symptoms,"I have been dealing with anxiety and stress for about 3-4 years now. I have been through a lot of stressful situations(the death of a parent and other close relatives in a short amount of time, breakup, school stuff). I was relatively young when it all started ( around 16-17). Since then I've been struggling with anxiety and stress, plus I have been diagnosed with mild depression. Every day is different for me. I am a huge hypochondriac and I am extremely afraid of hospitals. Since my first time in the hospital ( last year) I have been weirdly afraid of it. I can't stop googling symptoms and looking for answers for everything. 

 Since my first anxiety attack, throughout 3-4 years I have had stomach issues, back issues, and head issues. I have developed IBS, went to the doctor and he told me to stop stressing. I had a weird vibrating sensation in my right ear that used to come and go for about a year, went to 4 different doctors and nothing was wrong but they told me to stop stressing because that was the issue. Had a headache on the top of my head like a headband feeling, went to the doctor and told me it was nothing, but the minute I stepped out it disappeared. I had a heartbeat that was beating too fast, I could hear my heart and feel it move, problems with manual breathing, and felt like I couldn't get enough air. Temple aches. None of them were anything crazy but made me scared and annoyed. 

 Besides these, I felt so tired most of the time, especially in the winter time, I get lightheaded and I am afraid I am going to faint in public, but it never happened. I sometimes have days when I feel like it all went away and then something happens and destroys my mood and it's all back.

My most recent symptom is different and weirder, I have eye problems sometimes and I feel like I can't focus on them. I am not going to lie, I spend a lot of time on my phone and that could be the issue. Sometimes when I am in public (which happens very rarely ) I get the feeling like I am in an elevator or on the trampoline and I am walking on it, it's very scary and annoying. I sometimes feel like I am in a dream and I am watching through tunnel vision, I can't explain it because it's very hard to compare it to something. When I stay in bed I get a sensation like I am moving a bit and I get scared and then it's more intense, I had a period when I was so obsessed with it that I felt it when I went to sleep as well. It's like someone is constantly pushing me. Sometimes I feel like my heart is beating in my brain and I get a rush feeling in it or in the back of my head, all of a sudden. I have never been extremely dizzy or anything like that. It disappears when I go out and I take my mind off of it or when I do something and I concentrate. It comes when I am in a crowded place, like the store or the gym. I know it's anxiety because it happens when I think about it and then it scares me and it worse.

i also sometimes in my sleep have a weird sensation like a head rush and I have to open my eyes because I get dizzy, it happens also when I have a stressful day. And then I have a hard time falling asleep, but this happens rarely. I think I am inducing these feelings because I keep thinking about them, but it scares me so much. My therapist says it's a normal anxiety symptom.

192ibbj,Anxiety,2024-01-09,Women with anxiety had successful pregnancies?,"I experienced my first episode of severe anxiety during the pandemic. My main issue is a vicious loop of anxiety and insomnia. So it's really debilitating when I'm not sleeping.

Thankfully, I got treated with meds and therapy, and since then, things have been pretty much under control. I've even got off meds 2 years ago.

Now my Bf and I have been TTC since July. The TTC journey immediately gave me an uptick in anxiety and sleep issues, but nothing too crazy. We got pregnant really fast and sadly miscarried in the 1st trimester.

Now, I just found out I'm pregnant again, and my anxiety and sleep issues are really flaring up. I can't help it; it's like my body has gone into an automatic fear response of somekind.

I'd love to hear from women who have conceived healthy children even with more serious anxiety.

I am not opposed to going on meds again, I just know that it's not a cure-all. I still struggle even while on them, so I'm not sure it's worth the pain of going on and off and dealing with withdrawals (intense rebound insomnia) again."

192hxqt,Anxiety,2024-01-09,I don‚Äôt know what else to do,"I feel like nothing is working.

I feel like since 2020 I‚Äôve been drifting. Had horrible cystic acne breakout caused by a rare, bad reaction to accutane that left me with scars all over my cheeks, sent me into a deep depression where I got to 100 pounds from not eating.

One medication after another that didn‚Äôt work for my anxiety. Prozac gave me akathisia and panic attacks. Tons of SSRI withdrawal after being on them for 15 years.

Then comes dealing with a bad edible panic attack that landed me in the ER last December. Depersonalization/ derealization followed, along with nightmares and more panic attacks. When I say panic I don‚Äôt mean classic hyperventilation, I mean that weird break with reality where suddenly your vision becomes a tunnel and you feel yourself disconnecting and it‚Äôs utterly terrifying and then you can‚Äôt breathe and you legitimately feel you‚Äôre about to die.

Then I got food poisoning a month later that has lasted up until today - a slew of health issues, finding out I have a benign liver growth that‚Äôs the size of a lime, got pancreatitis and was in the hospital again for it (the trauma of a city understaffed ER is another story), found out my gallbladder barely works.

All this, while having issues with family (my sister had two suicide attempts many years ago) me lashing out at my partner out of trauma and causing damage to him emotionally, feeling utterly hopeless, on another SSRI that makes me an emotionless zombie but keeps the panic attacks and existential dread away. 

Somehow maintaining a full time job where everyone thinks I‚Äôm this star employee. What a joke, right? 

I‚Äôve gotten to a point where I have no joy in my life. I‚Äôm just on autopilot getting through each day. Things that should have made me happy leave me numb. Even thinking about happy thoughts elicit little to no emotion.

The only emotions I can express are despair if I cry and break down, or extreme rage when I‚Äôm hurt.

But that‚Äôs it.

I don‚Äôt know how to fix myself at this point. I‚Äôve been on 15 different psychiatric medications over the course of my life. One of them almost made me break. I am scared to keep trying and being a guinea pig.

I‚Äôm scared of the fact that my celexa makes me feel nothing at all most days.

Don't need medical advice I've already been to the hospital and everything was normal just looking to see if anyone has felt like this before. Some backstory ive been overly aware of my heartbeat for the past 2 years not sure why and around 3 months ago started having pvcs sometimes several in a minute not currently experiencing them.  
About 1 week ago I woke up in the middle of the night and felt confused, I knew where I was but felt like a plastic bag was put around my brain, my body and my thoughts didn't match what was going on when i moved my arm it would would a second later sort of like in quicksand. I went back to sleep hoping it would go away and after I woke up felt a bit better. 5 days ago I woke up with some arm discomfort nothing major but unusual as I hadn't done anything physical for weeks sort of felt like a pulling sensation inside the arm and sometimes like a burning sensation. Then around 3 days ago I stopped eating, I haven't been able to stomach anything, usually if I don't eat I feel fait but I just don't feel hungry and when I try to eat just have no appetite. Since then I've just been in bed 24/7 with my heart constantly beating hard but its never been as bad as this. I have no strength to get out of bed and do anything, even standing to use the toilet I feel faint and have no strength in my legs. Ive not been able to get a good long sleep im waking up a multiple times in the night with my heart racing and beating hard around 90bpm but i just ignore it and just and go back to sleep and my bed slightly wet when i wake up.  
Yesterday I went to the hospital as this isn't normal. The doctor said I was fine, temperature ecg bloods xray normal. likely just stress or anxiety. Today I woke and felt even worse, I tried to get up to feed my cats after being in bed for around 12 hours but my heart started beating hard not that fast and I felt a tiny small pain in my chest when moving, probably from the exhaustion and just collapsed back into my bed and the pain went away. I can't even move my legs they feel so weak and my left arm is burning if I just turn over in bed my heart rate shoots up for a couple seconds then goes back to normal. My blood pressure is elevated 140/85 not the usual 122/80 and I just feel so ill. I've never felt like this in my life i feel like im in a trance and when laying down im not seeing straight. I'm scared that I won't get better I understand it's likely anxiety but I've been dealing with anxiety for the past 2 years and have never experienced this I still don't feel hungry and even though I want to eat to give my body strength and just feel dizzy and lethargic."

i‚Äôm terrified of modern medicine (i literally freak over taking tylenol LOL) so i decided to try different natural options for my anxiety, one of them being kava. i had tried it once before at a kava bar and did really enjoy the way it made me feel generally more relaxed, a little giggly, and i had read some articles about kava as a daily anxiety treatment, so i gave it a try. i bought a tincture at whole foods and would take it once or twice a day in a little water. the first couple times it was fine, but i guess i didnt really believe the whole reverse tolerance thing until i experienced it. i would take it in the car before hanging out with friends, and eventually ended up getting heart palpitations and feeling lightheaded almost immediately. those symptoms would just freak me out and worsen my anxiety, and the weird uncomfortable feeling i got just wasnt worth it. i switched to cbd, and its been a total life saver the past couple months. every now and then, ill still use the kava tincture to make myself a few drinks if im with friends who are drinking actual alcohol (i dont drink alc), and i love it just as a fun drink. ill have 3ish drinks and nearly pee my pants from laughing and feeling so light and giddy. but yeah. please dont try it for every day. just wanted to share my experience in case anyone needed to hear the other end of it."
192gxhh,Anxiety,2024-01-09,Post Covid Panic Disorder - Seeking Support,"I wanted to share a bit about my recent experience after contracting COVID for the first time.

After recovering, I started experiencing tachycardia, for which my doctor prescribed beta blockers. Negative POTS test and cardiology cleared organ damage. Unfortunately, this led to extreme anxiety, especially health-related anxiety, and I found myself dealing with multiple panic attacks daily. I tried various coping methods like walking, meditation, and breathing techniques, but they didn't provide the relief I was hoping for.

In the midst of this, I had to resort to immediate-release Xanax during panic attacks, which helped but left me feeling like a bit of a zombie. I'm hesitant about becoming dependent on it and was desperate to find a more sustainable solution.

My doctor recommended Xanax XR 0.5mg for preventing attacks and suggested starting Lexapro. He mentioned that he's seen an increase in cases like mine post-COVID and, based on his experience, around 80% of similar cases have found relief with Lexapro.

I've had my reservations, especially about the side effects, but the constant struggle with anxiety has prompted me to give it a try. I've also tried various natural methods without success, so I'm hoping this might be the next step toward finding some balance.

I'm curious to hear if anyone else has faced similar challenges or has experiences to share."

192g35v,Anxiety,2024-01-09,Please i need help or at least suggestions how i can overcome this trauma.,"27 F
A trauma caused by my father. 
Back when i was a kid my father would always shout or pull and shot a gun anywhere if he losses temper, and it happened many times. It started when i was around 6 y/o, I remember if he goes home late and drunk i would hide because of fear and i would always pray to God that one day  my father‚Äôs behaviour will change. He wouldn‚Äôt hurt us but the trauma he is giving me is something i can‚Äôt take especially the fear. 

March2017 my graduation in college, we invited friends and relatives even our neighbours for a celebration. That time he stopped already drinking liquor, but they got a fight with his brother and again he losses temper. Instead of hurting his brother he pull a gun and shot it in above direction. 

Everyone was panicking, there i started trembling with fear and crying. Not only it caused embarrassment but also another trauma in my life. After this, I noticed my self that I easily get nervous over silly things and i would sometimes feel like me my heart beats fast if i see or hear him mad. 

Just a year ago, I talked to him about this. Fortunately my father changed like 3years ago. But still I‚Äôve got the trauma. My father would join fire shooting competition so i ask him since I‚Äôm very scared of gun, I wanted to try it to at least overcome this fear and try using it. So far it helped me, that every time i see him with a gun Im not afraid anymore. 

But now, my problem is i would still dream of it from time to time. Last time i dreamt of it is just an hour ago when i took a nap. There are also times that i would hear myself crying in the middle of my sleep specially if in my dream my father is shooting someone. The worst thing a dreamed before is he took the life of my brother from shooting him. üò≠üò≠ 

Do i need to go to psychiatrist now? Or is there any way it can help me overcome this? Thank you in advance. ‚ù§Ô∏è"
192frit,Anxiety,2024-01-09,Weird anxiety feeling tied to stomach problems,"Hello, 

  
I made this post trying to find someone with similar symptoms as I have. So back in august I had H. Plyori infection. It really affected my health and my first time in my life I had anxiety which was connected to the condition. I was taking the medication for a month and then it got away. It was all good but in the last month I kinda get the similar feeling sometimes when I eat certain food. I got tested yesterday for H. pylori and the test was negative. Also, I did a blood test and the blood is perfect, nothing was off. 

  
Yesterday in the evening I ate some ice cream and that weird anxiety/confusion/brain fog feeling came back. I was outside with my friends and even when I got back to my bed it was still like that. If someone had similar experience with certain food affecting their mood, or if you think it's something else I would like to hear your advice. My doctor today didn't really help me, he said it could be ""stress"" and ""bad diet"" but I'm not someone who is stressed a lot.

  
I was thinking it may be gastritis since my mother has it or it may be Hypochlorhydria?

  
Anyways, thanks for help!"

Like, anything, whether it's medication or surgery or whatever. I've been weight lifting since I was 21, and I'm 38 now. For the past 2 years, I have been unable to workout properly for more than say, 20 to 30 minutes at best. After a few sets, the anxiety kicks in: feels like my heart is pounding (my garmin watch says my HR is \~120 for example, which is not that high after having completed a set of chest or whatever...

I know 120 is a normal HR when you're lifting weight, but the feeling in the chest is there. I don't know how to describe it... the heart rate is normal, but the strenght of each pound seems bigger... like my blood pressure was going through the roof. Then I get anxious, a bit dizzy, tired and scared to the point I can't lift anymore.

It's debilitating, really. And I can't deal with it anymore. I tried meditation, stretching, the exercise where you place your hands behind your head and look to my 3 pm until my parasympathic system kicks in... none of this stuff works.

I have been dealing with hefty anxiety for a couple of years due to separate health conditions (chronic pain). Alongside the anxiety, I at some point began developing a chronic dry mouth as well as constricted sinuses i.e. hard to breathe through my nose, but no mucus. 

I‚Äôve spoken to my doctor about this and we have tried a few things such as nasal sprays, irrigation, allergy meds, etc. but nothing has made any difference. 

I‚Äôm wondering now if this overall dryness may be caused by my anxiety - and if anyone has ever experienced something similar. 

Due to my pain and the effect that has on many aspects of my life, I would say I am very often, if not always, in a state of ‚Äòflight‚Äô (palpitations, sweats, shaking). Are these symptoms just my body reacting and diverting priority to other bodily functions because of this?

192ddrk,Anxiety,2024-01-09,First day of school n horrible anxiety,"So, I recently got back to school yesterday, and I had gotten no sleep whatsoever (which probably contributed to this anxiety attack because cortisol and whatnot). I got up at six, couldn't eat, then got a lump in my throat, which made me think I was gonna throw up. I got on the bus, the lump hadn't gone away, and I felt really nauseous. Got to school, still the same.

My first period, my heart was a little fast sitting, but getting up was horrible. It was so fast, and I was scared. I was still nauseous and had bad thoughts like thinking I was gonna die or throw up‚Äîabsolutely horrible. It didn't get much better 2nd period, although I had a ton of friends. Even then, I still had anxiety, so I just fell asleep.

3rd period was the same dreadful nauseous feeling, fixed only by sleeping. I had lunch, and man, I was going through it. Keep in mind I just gave up all my friends to get closer to Christ. I was sitting alone, and man, the thoughts I was having were horrible‚Äîjust constant ""you have no friends,"" ""nobody likes you or cares about you."" But that's probably just anxiety and sleep deprivation at its peak, to be honest. My heart was still racing, so to calm myself down, I was taking walks and stuff periodically. People talked to me but laughed when I was boring and just said hi; people are so rude for no reason sometimes.

4th period, man, was pretty easy. I had many distractions like a test I hadn't done, and we watched a movie. But 5th period might've been the absolute worst. Before winter break on the last day, we had finals, and I threw up in my 5th period. Man, coming back was horrible. My anxiety was at its peak, my heart was racing, I felt the horrible feeling of impending doom, my hands were sweaty, my feet cold, and nauseous too. Horrible, I wouldn't wish this on anyone, I overcame it though just by waiting but even then it was horrible.

6th period didn't help; I still had some of that anxiety. But I talked to this one stoner girl I knew, she probably has panic attacks frequently because she smokes a ton of carts and gets really high so she got really good tips, but anyways I calmed myself down, took a little nap, and it helped. Honestly, I think all of this was just my sleep deprivation and anxiety‚Äînot a great combo at all. My phone had died at school, and I had no distractions, so just me and my anxiety. It's dreadful. At least I skipped today; my mom made the excuse that the weather was bad, but I know that she just wants me to rest. I told her about yesterday; she got so worried for me. She's a genuinely good mom but can't help me that much due to a language barrier and the fact that my Medicaid expired, and we are poor, so no going to doctors nor psychiatrists, lol."

I considered pulling over but didnt and drove the rest of the way home (3-4 hours). 

When i got home i checked the car for dents or scratches but there were none. For the next few days i was very anxious that i possibly hit someone while driving or caused an accident although my memory has no recollection of anything like this happening. 

I forgot about this driving session for awhile but now the memory of driving high has come roaring back and im very scared that i might have done something wrong. I start therapy in a couple days for what i think is severe anxiety (not just about this driving thing but lots of other things as well) but wondering what you all think of this situation. Can being paranoid cause memory loss such that i dont remember hitting a pedestrian or other car on a freeway at night? Thanks."
19291nu,Anxiety,2024-01-09,Feeling anxious and down during the evening and night time," Since childhood, I've experienced periods where as the day transitions to evening and night, my mood tends to take a downturn, accompanied by increased anxiety. It's as if a sense of impending doom envelops me, occasionally leading to physical discomfort. These feelings intensify when facing challenges or problems, making nights particularly difficult. I'm aware that others share similar experiences, and I'm curious about effective strategies to overcome and improve this issue? Thank you."
1928o5t,Anxiety,2024-01-09,Applying for SNAP leads to anxiety,"So, I‚Äôll try not to go on and on but for the last few days I have gotten a paper that pretty much says I ‚Äúhave to work 30 hours a week to get SNAP‚Äù *but* I have been getting SNAP assistance for the last few years. Also, I have no car and live in a small country town AND I do work (just not 30 hours a week, NOBODY at my job works those hours a week, it‚Äôs a small business). I call Social Services, wait 30 minutes in a queue, get a person, get transferred, then another person, get transferred again, and then that person doesn‚Äôt even pick up. I anxiously leave a voice mail. I get a call 5 hours later, this woman says to ignore the paperwork cause they ‚Äúsend it out to everyone.‚Äù

Now, I know most people have different worries but isn‚Äôt that strange that Social Services deliberately sends out paperwork to *everyone* despite not knowing if said paperwork will cause said person to have a panic attack? How is this ‚Äúhelping‚Äù anyone? These big companies and organizations always say they are ‚Äúhere to help‚Äù and whatever they believe but they are only here to cause people to get anxiety and give up on the whole process altogether.

The above was this morning, I go all day and I check the mail and now my partner has gotten a letter from social services saying that I ‚Äúleft the household‚Äù even though I did not, I simply want my *own* benefit card with *my* SNAP/ Foodstamps on it so it‚Äôs easier then juggling around one card! So now I have to call Social Services again in the morning and explain it to them like they are five that I do, in fact, still live at my current address and that I simply want my own benefit card (like I‚Äôve told them three times now). I‚Äôve even told them I have anxiety and one of my anxious feelings is talking on the phone. It‚Äôs just so frustrating and I hate it that I even bothered going for SNAP/ foodstamps now, non-stop stress!

Sorry, just had to rant and get it out there."

I have been on multiple medications to try and help. They help for a short while but then poop out so then I have to switch to something else‚Ä¶ 

Anyways. I currently take Viibryd 40mg and it‚Äôs been meh. Not great but not terrible. 

I was on a walk in my neighborhood a few weeks ago, all of a sudden, I get a panic attack out of nowhere (I could feel it building up) and I started to panic on my walk?? My heart rate reached 185 after I started to panic and started running (idk why I did this, I was trying to get back to my house to try and calm down) so I‚Äôm sure that has something to do with the increased heart rate, but now I don‚Äôt wanna go on a walk in my neighborhood anymore cause I‚Äôm so uncomfortable and nervous it‚Äôll happen again. I feel on edge now when I try to walk in my neighborhood, and it‚Äôs cause I think I‚Äôm scared I‚Äôm gonna have a panic attack again?? I went on walks since then but I‚Äôve been on edge every single time and I can‚Äôt go for the long walk so used to due to the anxiety? 

I have no problem working out in the morning tho at my gym, it‚Äôs just this specific situation I think. I notice I get kinda nervous after taking my Viibryd so I‚Äôm wondering if that has anything to do with it."

192862f,Anxiety,2024-01-09,death anxiety? life crisis,"i‚Äôm so scared to die. every now and then i think about this and it consumes my life for a while. i‚Äôm not scared of it hurting or anything. what i‚Äôm scared of is not existing. i know i shouldn‚Äôt worry because i won‚Äôt know and it will be nothing but i hate the fact that one day i will not be me. i will be nothing and that terrifies me. what is the point of anything then? why am i here? i hate it so much and it gives me so much anxiety and i can‚Äôt think about anything else. i know i should enjoy life while i can but what even is the point when none of this means anything? time goes so fast. i feel like just yesterday i was a little kid and now i‚Äôm already about to be graduating high school and going off to college. i‚Äôm finally the age i always dreamed of being when i young and i just wish i could go back. i don‚Äôt want my life to be over the next time i blink my eyes. i‚Äôm so mad at the world for giving us so little time to be here. i know sometimes life can suck but i feel like i take it for granted. even through the most horrible and devastating experiences i‚Äôve had, i was still here, alive. i was me. i cannot fathom how one day i will no longer be me. i will be nothing. all that will be left of me are memories that will slowly slip away. and then it will be as if i was never even here to begin with. i know that‚Äôs all my ego talking. the more i think about it maybe i‚Äôm so deeply afraid of dying because i don‚Äôt want to be forgotten‚Ä¶but how am i supposed to get over that? i feel like there‚Äôs nothing more human than fearing your existence being erased. i know i will never be important enough to be in the history books but even if i was‚Ä¶every book, every page will someday whither away. one day the sun will die out and we will all die a slow cold death. and there‚Äôs nothing we can do about it. this makes me think about bugs. how silly and unimportant they seem to us. but they are living life just like us. maybe they fear death as well. maybe everyday before they go off they hug their bug friends and tell them to be careful not to be stepped on. what about bugs make them any less important than us? why are their lives less meaningful than ours? i wish i didn‚Äôt think so much. sometimes i think if i was just oblivious to the world that i would be much happier. imagine how peaceful it would be to not read into the lines of everything. i wish i could just accept that i will die one day for how it is. i can‚Äôt accept it. maybe it‚Äôs because i apply meaning to everything. everything has to have a purpose right? human life has to be apart of something so much bigger, right? but maybe there is no meaning and that terrifies me. maybe we were just a species that evolved and accidentally gained self-awareness. maybe we are just here to procreate and die. if that‚Äôs the case i wish society didn‚Äôt force us to work everyday and become a part of this system. how beautiful it would be to just wake up in a field of grass and decide that today you will go pick strawberries. i wish i could live in a world where money and jobs didn‚Äôt exist. a world where you didn‚Äôt have to have a ‚Äúpurpose‚Äù, you could just be. i never know how to explain that to people. i just want to be. i don‚Äôt want to go into a certain field or career, i don‚Äôt want to live the same never-ending life everyday. i want to be everything simultaneously. i want to create films. and i want to write romance novels. and i want to live in france and eat cute little desserts at a cafe. i want to marry a handsome man and have 3 kids who i love dearly. and i want to be single and free my whole life and travel the world. i want to be a lawyer and carry a cute little briefcase to work everyday and i want to save someone‚Äôs life because i am a passionate and focused surgeon. i want to live every life at once and it is impossible..it reminds me of a quote from the bell jar. ‚ÄúI saw my life branching out before me like the green fig tree in the story. From the tip of every branch, like a fat purple fig, a wonderful future beckoned and winked. One fig was a husband and a happy home and children, and another fig was a famous poet and another fig was a brilliant professor, and another fig was Ee Gee, the amazing editor, and another fig was Europe and Africa and South America, and another fig was Constantin and Socrates and Attila and a pack of other lovers with queer names and offbeat professions, and another fig was an Olympic lady crew champion, and beyond and above these figs were many more figs I couldn't quite make out. I saw myself sitting in the crotch of this fig tree, starving to death, just because I couldn't make up my mind which of the figs I would choose. I wanted each and every one of them, but choosing one meant losing all the rest, and, as I sat there, unable to decide, the figs began to wrinkle and go black, and, one by one, they plopped to the ground at my feet.‚Äù this so perfectly describes me and how i feel. i feel like i‚Äôm so focused on giving my life meaning that in the end it will have none. all i have is potential that is being wasted. every hobby that i‚Äôve taken up that i give up on in 2 weeks. every passion i‚Äôve let burn out because it was too hard. why can‚Äôt i stick to anything? sometimes i wish i didn‚Äôt feel so deeply but i know that ultimately it makes me who i am. i am someone who feels deeply. and part of me feels like i should be happy about that. i should be happy that the life i was given, i get to feel deeply in. and if this is the only life i will be given, then i am grateful that i was me. maybe i‚Äôm so scared to die because deep down i feel like i‚Äôm meant to do something important. i feel different. i don‚Äôt feel like anyone else in my family or any of my friends. maybe that sounds self-centered but i don‚Äôt feel it in the way that‚Äôs putting them down. they are all special in their own way. i just feel like the odd one out. i feel like there‚Äôs something significantly different about myself but i can‚Äôt put my finger on it. i just hope that life means something in the end. reincarnation comforts me. just the thought of me being able to live out every single one of my fantasies comforts me. i could be everything. if that‚Äôs true then i shouldn‚Äôt worry about who i should be in this life because it wouldn‚Äôt really matter then. if i get to live every life for eternity then i will be happy to die. because it will not be death, it will be rebirth. part of me really believes in reincarnation because sometimes i can feel the weight of my past lives. sometimes when i talk to people i feel that i have known them before. i know that in a past life they were my friend or family member, or even my partner. and i wonder if they can feel it too. sometimes you just click with people and yeah maybe it‚Äôs just personality‚Äôs lining up or maybe it‚Äôs a coincidence but it can‚Äôt be."

This all started when I had a stomach bug, I did a cat scan of my abdomen and they said I was backed up and took that as blockage in my colon causing me to be backed up because I was using the bathroom fairly often.. anyway I googled my symptoms at the time it was stomach noises, frequent bathroom use and my stool kept changing. I googled and my symptoms matched up perfectly with colon cancer, after that I developed a host of other symptoms that won‚Äôt get into but needless to say these symptoms matched up with colon cancer perfectly. Anyway I was freaking out going to the ER almost everyday begging for a colonoscopy I was crying every night. Finally did my colonoscopy all they found was gastritis and after that my symptoms magically disappeared literally a day later. After that I developed twitching and I googled again and google lead me to ALS and I spiralled again convinced this was what I had I started noticing dents on parts of my body and I drove myself mad again.. l did the  test nothing was wrong. All this stress I think caused me to develop insomnia and I googled again and found what they call fatal insomnia it did a sleep study and it showed everything was normal. I still battle with dealing with this whole sleep thing but I‚Äôm trying my best not to spiral as much as I use to. I wrote all this to say that health anxiety is terrible and it will ruin your life but remember that sometimes this is all in our heads.

So with severe health anxiety I often switch between things and Health issues sometimes I come back to one sometimes I just leave it behind and jump to a new one. 

So this week it‚Äôs been about chest/respiratory infections, pneumonia, bronchitis those kinds of things after I got 5 nosebleeds in 4 days and got it followed up with TONS of chest nose and throat symptoms that don‚Äôt feel normal. I think it‚Äôs a combination of a chest infection a respiratory infection nasal irritation and acid reflux. Some of the most worrying symptoms I face are overproduction of SO MUCH mucus and snot it‚Äôs crazy. I‚Äôve ‚Äúchoked‚Äù on it a little bit but not to total suffocation. 

Questions:

-is it possible to suffocate or choke on secretions from like acid and mucus to death while awake or sleeping?what do I see stories about people passing out from the exact same thing even when they‚Äôre young and just have normal congestion?

- if a full airway obstruction(can‚Äôt cough can‚Äôt breathe can‚Äôt make sound)does occur what would I do? Would I just have to you know just die? Would leaning forward or something in this case work?"

Also these days all I do is work and spend time with my family, maybe that is the other reason as I do not want them to worry. The past year I've travelled a lot and that didn't happen to me at all. Maybe I should also consider the stuff I hear and read about Palestine and Israel as well, I know that Morocco is not close, but still."
1927eci,Anxiety,2024-01-09,"I felt at peace for the first time in a long time, despite circumstances that threw me for a loop, and now it‚Äôs coming back","I had surgery on 1/5 that I‚Äôd been deeply anxious about for about a month and a half. When I was there, I surprisingly didn‚Äôt feel much anxiety (my mom was there with me and I was taking lots of notes of what was happening so I could make a Reddit post for those who were like me and had anxiety). The surgery went fine, healing has begun, and my mom was with me for 2.5 days afterwards. 

She went home yesterday and I could feel the generalized anxiety creeping back in. I‚Äôve been alone all day (I live alone) and it‚Äôs back to an almost panic level. I just feel safer, more secure, more supported with a person *here*. Not just with the surgery recovery, but in general. My brother was here for a few days during the holidays before the surgery and he just made it so clear that he cared about me and we had fun. 

My mom won‚Äôt be back until Wednesday (2 days from now), and I just feel so alone. I grew up in a household of 5, but then my parents divorced and shaved that population to 4. We all grew up and now my brother lives in Florida and my twin sister is in California. My dad now lives in Alabama while my mom and I are in Ohio, 45 minutes away from each other. 

What the hell is someone supposed to do to not be so anxious with the lack of people living with them? It‚Äôs not like I‚Äôm in danger when they‚Äôre gone, it just feels like I‚Äôm taken care of and loved more when they‚Äôre physically with me. I have friends but barely see them in person. I‚Äôm almost too anxious to go out and meet people who could be there for me in person. I‚Äôm probably just tired from healing and lack of sleep because of that but I‚Äôm also trying not to dismiss my feelings and accept them as valid, in which case I‚Äôm back to asking how someone can feel less anxious when they rely on the presence of other people to not be so anxious?"

1927bu8,Anxiety,2024-01-09,Persistent anxiety,"I had a pretty intense year last year, including stress, anxiety and health scares. 
It's left it's mark on me and I can't seem to shift it.

When everything first happened, I had a month off work, and going back to work felt like torture, a continuous cycle of feeling severe panic would happen all day on and off, what felt like every 5 minutes. 

I'm much better now, but there is a lingering sense that I'm not ok, and still have pretty bad anxiety most days. I can't stop focusing on it and checking if I'm back to ""normal"" again every time I wake up and throughout the day. This is obviously keeping it alive.

I have been doing mindfulness meditation to try and help, which has at times, but I think I've been overthinking it pretty badly, and subconsciously judging myself if I'm not present.

I always tend to dive into things 110% and I think I've done that with meditation, normally I would distract myself if I feel anxious, but meditation kind of tells you that that is just hiding from it and doesn't solve the issue, so I guess I'm just ""aware"" of it all the time and I don't know if that's the right or wrong thing to do üò£. 

I know the fear of it not going away is strong, which keeps it there, and I don't know what to do next. I'm getting so exhausted trying to deal with it.

On top of this, I've been reading about the nature of human existence and reality, sort of based around Buddhism and spirituality and normally I would enjoy that, but I think it just makes me anxious about reality and that nobody really knows what it is, and how it can slip away at any point. I think I might have some derealization from the really intense stress and anxiety from last year too. So yeah, all of that plus existential anxiety.

Has anyone had anything similar or any advice on how to deal with it?

Thank you for your time."

My first match I won, but then in the second one it came to my attention it would be livestreamed in twitch and throughout the arcade. I became so nervous to the point I was almost gonna have a panic attack.

And I was versing a well known professional in the game. I got absolutely destroyed and humiliated. I even heard people gasping and excited when he was destroying me from the other room.

After that I continued playing losers, lost in the next game and stayed for a while before leaving.

I dropped out of my major in college, I was lucky to graduate. I started a job after graduating, I quit after one month. I just gave notice at my old job that I want to move on from - oh wait, I'm too much of a coward to go on a limb and push myself for something more - so I begged them to take me back.

  
The part that seals my fate is that for me is that I always have an out. When I am forced to face my fear of failure, my life is torture. I can't sleep, I can't eat, every waking moment is just anxiety that rocks me to my core. But if I walk away from my stressor? Poof! I get instant relief. It slowly gets replaced by depression and lethargy, but it beats having to face the possibility of not being good enough, because at least I can say I'm not even trying.

  
It's like being locked in a room where I can always knock on the door and know it will be unlocked for me when I decide I can't take it anymore. Sometimes I wish I could find that room I could lock myself in and not get out of, so I could learn to face what's inside or die."

Ive been dealing with mental health issues for about  8  years now and no one really knows whats wrong with me or how to help so ive really just fallen through the cracks, I have started with a new psychiatrist but im not overly hopeful that it will go anywhere . 

My anxiety gets so bad I dissociate causing me not to be able to drive which my parents kinda look down on. I also cant get a job because I had a really bad co-op exsperiance that tramatized me and caused me to be hospitalized and I already had anxiety about working so now its even worse, I done know what I want to do in terms of school and the thought of actually existing scares me shitless. Ive never really had friends and have just lived in my room so I dont have anything and I know my parents are so sick of my shit they are now trying to force me to do things without them whitch is just casuing me to shut down even more.
Honestly I was hoping I wouldn't be here anymore so I wouldnt have to feel like im living in a constant state of parazlizing anxiety and mental health issues and being a burden to my family but sadly that didnt happen. 

I just dont know what to do anymore, I feel hopeless that I cant function in a way society wants me to and a part of me really dosent want to because I know im going to be miserable.  I just feel so stuck and I feel so stupid and angry that somthing that comes so easily to seemingly everyone is impossible to me."
1925n37,Anxiety,2024-01-09,Separation Anxiety,"Just a panic induced rant here. Does anything else have SEVERE separation anxiety when they are home alone or away from their ‚Äúcomfort people‚Äù? It literally causes me to be physically and mentally ill. I am a 30yo F and have had significant amounts of anxiety all throughout life. My newly found issue is that I am literally terrified to be alone. I constantly worry about irrational things and spiral into a full blown panic attack. I live with my mom and she is usually always home with me so there‚Äôs not an issue when my husband goes to work. However, her sister is sick and she is staying about 45 minutes away and not only do I panic about being alone through the day, I am panicking about being away from her and that she will be nervous/anxious to. She has anxiety like I do and she isn‚Äôt comfortable being away from her home. I know there is much worse out there but when you have panic attacks, everything feels like it‚Äôs the worst thing ever. Any help or advice would be appreciated. Love this community ‚ù§Ô∏è"

I had a small anxiety attack this morning and took a little of my emergency propanalol ( I‚Äôm prescribed 10mg, but I broke the pill and only took like 3mg). That was at like 9:30 am and I felt off all day afterwards. So I went to cityMD at 6pm and got a checkup and EKG. All was fine in the checkup but doc told me not to drink tonight. 

The issue is that I‚Äôm a pretty heavy drinker, I have at least two or three large glasses of red wine every night if not more. If I don‚Äôt have any wine tonight I‚Äôm worried I might have withdrawal symptoms that will make my anxiety worse, but I also don‚Äôt wanna mix downers and potentially make things worse. 

I know I only took a very small dose and it‚Äôs been over 12 hours, but I‚Äôm kinda lost here. Any tips?"

1923wmm,Anxiety,2024-01-09,Intense itching when stressed/anxious,"I hope this is the right subreddit to post about this but I've been desperately trying to figure out what it is that I'm going through and seeing if there's any fixes/remedies.

I've had this really bad itch for about 5-6 years now and the main areas it affects are around my scalp, sides/back of my head, and also around my upper back. Scratching it usually just makes it worse and more intense. The itch usually happens whenever I feel stressed/anxious, such as simply being out in public, as I have social anxiety and always worry about other people looking at me or judging me. Doing anything physically intensive also triggers the itch, such as running, lifting weights, or simply just lifting anything even remotely heavy in general, and this happens whether I'm alone or in public at a gym. The itch usually only goes away once I stop feeling stressed/anxious, like for example if I start itching in public, it goes away once I get in the car and I'm alone. One thing to note that's important but really weird about the itch is that it happens all throughout the year but then it goes away **completely** from around the end of May up until the beginning of November, and this happens consistently every single year since the itch first started happening. No matter what I do or what situation I'm in during this period of time, the itch never happens but once it's past that period, it starts happening again without fail. 

I've tried searching online to see if anyone else has had the exact same experience as me and also for any remedies but I haven't been able to find anything. It's just so difficult for me to function and do things normally with this itch but I have no idea what to do about it and I don't know if it's some sort of condition or health related, or if it's just something simple. If anyone knows of any possible ways to fix my itch, please let me know because I just want to be able to do things normally for once"

Most of the time it starts from feeling like I can't completely catch my breath or I get the weird dizziness in my head almost like the room is moving around me and I'm going to lose balance. From there heart pounds super hard, my hands and/or feet will fall asleep completely and feel numb and weak and I feel like I can't walk or talk right. I will get all sweaty and pale and intense feelings of something is seriously wrong with me. The ambulance will come and they always admit me to the hospital because my heart rate shows 150s-180s and increased BP. They never find anything wrong and cardiologist has ruled out anything major but they did find out I have {PACS} Premature Atrial contractions which are super mild and not threatening.

1923v2y,Anxiety,2024-01-09,not sure what to do,"Just going to start off by saying I (23F) struggle really badly with anxiety, depression, and PTSD from family and their substance abuse. Lately it's gotten much much worse as my dad relapsed on drugs and my mom copes with alcohol and my siblings cope with weed. Anyways, I started IOP treatment last Thursday in hopes it will help with my anxiety. My boyfriend (25M) of 10 months has been so supportive. We do get in little arguments and we had one bad experience that we sorted out really well but we have never actually fought badly until today. We were eating out before he had to go to work and we didn't have a lot of time. For treatment my homework was to tell someone in my support system the things I have learned and ask it they can add to my list of things I fear and things I avoid. I asked him and he just gave me a look like I have so many avoidances that he didn't even know where to begin. Naturally this made me cry bc it was overwhelming to see that he probably feels overwhelmed and thinks I have so many things that I am afraid of and it just felt like a harsh judgement of where I'm at in life. He said sorry but it made me feel so awful. He had to go to work and I called him on the way there to try to sort it out and to hopefully make me feel better. Well he was obviously frustrated and raised his voice and told me that I flake too much bc of my anxiety and he just wants to tell me to suck it up because if i wanted to actually get better, I would, and it wouldn't be so hard. I hung up on him bc those are quite literally the worst things someone could say to me in regard to my mental health. My friends aren't emotional people and aren't the most supportive and my family all struggles with similar stuff as well as things I don't want to be apart of. I'm feeling so down and i lost some trust for him. He has never said anything like that to me hefore and now l'm questioning every time he has been patient, kind, compassionate, and understanding even though he has no idea what im dealing with. Like is this the real him or is it just too much now? I'm scared I deal with too much that he can't handle. I'm scared we have to break up bc what if it gets worse and he begins to hate me more and more because he cant take all this away from me and it stresses him out? Idk. I'm rambling. We're texting about it now but he's working. Half of me wants to just end it and the other half wants to make up. Any support would be nice."

Hey everyone, I would really appreciate some help with some stress I'm going through right now. I'm going to provide some context and then explain the issues I'm experiencing. I know this is going to be really long, but I implore you to read this because I'm struggling! I have a therapist, but an outside perspective would really help. Everyone here has struggled with stress and anxiety. Have any of you had a similar situation? How do you cope?

Context/background: 
I started a new job a couple of months ago, and I'm really struggling to manage the stress. I've had multiple (like maybe a dozen) ER and psychiatric hospitalizations due to stress-related crises, and a few of these crises have been due to stress related to previous jobs. It's been 16 months since my last hospitalization, and 2 months ago I decided I felt stable enough to pursue full-time employment after testing the waters with a part-time job for the previous 5 months. I told myself that I would not take on a job that seemed like there would be a lot of stress associated with it, that does not have a thorough and supportive training program, that does not offer support to employees, and that does not have effective communication and good rapport among employees. 

In my interview with this job, I expressed all of my needs and concerns and asked specific questions so I could make an informed decision that this company would be appropriate for me. I was assured by the 3 interviewers that they have an excellent, thorough, and supportive training process and that I would never be thrown into any situation that would make me feel uncomfortable or where I would be unprepared, that they won an award this past year for being one of the best places to work in the state with one of the best teams. I was also told I would get my own office.

The problem(s): 
This employer has broken every single promise from the first day I started. I've been thrown into a bunch of difficult situations I'm not prepared for after receiving no training or very little training. I share an office with an employee who started a week before me, and she's constantly taking personal calls in the office or asking me for help (yes, I wear noise-canceling headphones), so it's impossible to concentrate. She's also struggling so much that they've taken away responsibilities from her and given them to me. Certain team members will not communicate with me or do their jobs no matter how much I put forth the effort to facilitate things smoothly. All of my coworkers and my supervisor are passive-aggressive and act like I'm an idiot when I ask for help and make suggestions. The client population is also a difficult demographic to deal with, and I'm feeling completely unsupported, overwhelmed, and overworked. I'm being given more and more responsibilities with no support. Similar situations have happened to me, and I've had major issues coping in those situations. I'm only 16 months out from my last major crisis.

I don't feel like I can quit. They gave me a sign-on bonus that I will have to pay back if I quit or change positions within a year. This company is also a major player in my field in my very small local area, and the people who work there have connections with everybody else in the area, so I'm afraid that quitting this job could potentially lead to being blacklisted from other employment opportunities in the field. I have a spotty employment history and don't want to add another unsuccessful situation to my work history. I also think it's important for me to learn perseverance, and I don't want to quit any time things get tough.

How do I manage all of this stress and take care of myself? I see my therapist (who is an anxiety specialist) every two weeks, and I see my psychiatrist next month. I've been trying to practice self-care and have been journaling, meditating, reading, listening to music, and buying nice things for myself. Even with all of this stuff, I can't stop thinking about work 24/7. I have bad dreams and nightmares about work. I frequently feel on the verge of a panic attack. I've felt like crying even though I haven't cried in over a year. The stressful situations at work aren't going to ease up any time soon--they're actually going to get worse because I'm being given a lot of big, new responsibilities in the coming weeks.

What should I do to maintain my health? How can I prevent a crisis? How can I have a better work-life balance? How do I continue to force myself to come into work every day? I called out today because of the overwhelming stress. I have to go back tomorrow, but it feels so difficult. I don't want to end up in the hospital again, but the consequences of quitting feel really bad too. How can I do this?"

So I decided to try a cold shower, not ice cold but uncomfortable. I thought for sure I'd read 160/100, to my surprise it was 122/80. I measured it 3 times to be sure.

19214cf,Anxiety,2024-01-09,I feel old though I'm just 25,"Despite being 25, I don't have any substantial skills and especially lack social skills. I have an anxious personality. And I feel like there hasn't been any positive change in my personality since high school. Back in school, I was a shy kid but I hoped someday I'd be able to be more confident and do decently well in all parts of life. I don't feel that anymore. Feels like there will be no change in my personality. I feel trapped. And it keeps affecting my daily life. I'm job hunting and keep bombing interviews. I keep worrying about class presentations that are more than 2 months away. Hell, I'm even having trouble making conversation and making eye-contact with my friends. My body's giving up too. I was kind of a weak child but now I suddenly have so many health issues (nothing serious but still serious enough to make me worry constantly about how it will evolve 20-30 years from now). It's like I'm finally realizing I'm not a teenager anymore because of my body but I still have the mind and skills of a teenager. Going into college, I had big dreams of making good money. I'll soon finish my master's degree with no job and I'm worried about not meeting next month's rent. This isn't the life I had imagined for myself. I'm having a hard time coming to terms with it and improving it."
1920ys2,Anxiety,2024-01-09,Overthinking about what I said to a friend,"I think I was inadvertently rude to my friend when I had no intention of doing so and now I can‚Äôt stop stressing out about it.

For some information, I was at a new year‚Äôs party last night. It was an all girls event and I was invited by my sorority sister. I went to her house, and there were about six of us. 

Four of us were in the same sorority, and two of whom were her roommates. The host, who invited me, let me call her Lilly for privacy reasons. We‚Äôre all graduated now. Anyways, the party went well. We did mood boards, kinda like real life pinterest. Had some cheese and crackers.

When I was on my way out and saying goodbye to everyone, and I hugged one of her roommates and told her it was nice to meet her and that I loved her house, her roommate said, ‚Äúyeah! come anytime as you like.‚Äù I said, ‚Äúoh ok! yeah if Lilly will let me.‚Äù I think my friend (Lilly) and the roommate were a little confused and wheels were churning. 

It seemed like she was like, ‚Äúwhy would she say that?‚Äù I can‚Äôt remember every detail but i think i said that same phrase twice. ‚ÄúOh yeah! if lilly will *let* me.‚Äù My perception is that she might have been offended or thought it was strange. I hope she doesn‚Äôt think that I think she‚Äôs controlling or something like that. I love her dearly she‚Äôs such a great friend but idk. I don‚Äôt know why I‚Äôm stressing so much about it. I texted her this morning and thanked her for the invite and said i love her. We say it to each other all the time. She responded and thanked me for driving far (about 40 mins) to see her. I said it was totally worth the drive and would do it again. Did i come off as passive aggressive? should I say something to Lilly? I feel anxious about it. If this is relevant I didn‚Äôt exactly grow up in a calm childhood. I grew up constantly apologizing. But.. was I rude? I really meant to say, ‚Äúyes! if lilly wants me to come over.‚Äù 

Help.

Edit: not sure if this was the right subreddit. but i wanted to post so i could get some advice. i would appreciate it, thanks folks. "

1920c2t,Anxiety,2024-01-09,Approaching Big Storm Is Giving Me Anxiety,"This upcoming storm is prompting two weather alerts:

**WIND ADVISORY** for Tuesday afternoon until Wednesday morning.

**FLOOD WATCH** for roughly the same time period.

My main concern is the combination of heavy rain and strong winds which may cause power outages.  I always freak out when these types of storms threaten the area where I live.  Power outages make me hyperventilate, depending on how long they last.  My pulse rate skyrockets before a storm even arrives.  I often lose valuable sleep, and I don't sleep well as it is.

According to what I read, wind gusts are expected to reach 55 mph!  These gusts can trigger outages, even by themselves.  Add heavy rain and saturated ground, and they will only make things worse!  As if I don't have enough things that give me anxiety.  Now, I need to worry about this big rain and windstorm!  Why can't we have peaceful weather systems?  Why must they always be dangerous?!  The previous storm gave me bad anxiety, but this one sounds worse than the other one!

For reference, I live in Northwest New Jersey in Warren County.

I don't know if this post counts as a **TRIGGER WARNING**, but I put it up, just in case.  I couldn't think of what other flair to use here.

19208aj,Anxiety,2024-01-08,Embarrassing/Cringe-worthy memories wiping out my self esteem.,"I don‚Äôt know if this is common among people with anxiety or it‚Äôs just me, but I will have a memory of myself that was years ago or even a few months ago and just be completely horrified over the person I came off as. 

A lot of the memories are accompanied by something mean said by another person about me, where I‚Äôm in full agreement with what they said, that I was in fact being cringe or weird as fuck. Some memories I‚Äôll just think that even if people didn‚Äôt say something mean, I was still being a loser and it‚Äôs self inflicted.

I‚Äôll usually tell myself, hey maybe the people being mean were partially right and you did not have the best awareness at that point, and if anything it is a great learning opportunity. But the same memories keep coming up worse and worse. 

Normally this will happen and I‚Äôll have a good self esteem going beforehand that day, but something will trigger the memory. Sometimes the bad memories can be triggered by something so small and trivial, like a simple word or a phrase, but my brain never fails to bring back the embarrassment that I felt in the memory.

It sucks, for example, this morning I woke up feeling energized and confident. I shared some coffee with my dad while having a nice conversation. Something he said brought up a certain embarrassing memory and it literally ruined my ability to socialize for the next hour or so. My dad was talking about something completely unrelated as well, but he used a single word that made me think of one embarrassing memory I have..? Literally just one word will do it.

Why am I so fragile to this shit? It‚Äôs not like I was sexually abused or hurt physically, I was just being a weirdo and embarrassing myself somehow in the memory. And it‚Äôs so fucking painful. It destroys all the momentum I have going in that day."

I wish we could do more for than animals. They don‚Äôt abuse them. But they haven‚Äôt taught their dog not to bark, which is annoying, because he does it incessantly.

It has been a few months but I still don't feel quite at home in my new city. I am studying biology. But it is hard to make friends.

I joined a student and study association. Went to events. I met so much new people. But no new real friends. I don't know what I am doing wrong. Naturally I am an introvert, maybe ambivert. It takes me a lot of energy to go to events. I feel really tired afterward.

In my childhood I was bullied. Always the odd one out. I felt alone. I did not like the small town school. Never had a big friend group. I always had difficulty with making friends (I am diagnosed with a light form of autism&amp;ADD, therefore the social struggles). So I thought (hoped) at university I will have a big friend group. Unfortunately, I don't have a friend group yet. 

Probably overthinking it. I should give it some time. But maybe I suck at making friends.. It makes me feel so so insecure. About my looks, about my personality. I just don't feel relaxed around people. I feel stressed, lonely, insecure and unhappy. A big part of why I feel that way is that last year my dad died. His death had a really big impact on me.

I need advice. About making friends as a 21 year old. About accepting yourself. How to stay positive. How to keep hope. How do I grow up!?"

I need some support. It‚Äôs a long post but it‚Äôs been my life for the last 4 years, please read and try to give me some releaf from my misery.
I‚Äôm currently a Medical student and a former dental student. I‚Äôve made a mistake. Dentistry has been my passion and I wanted to pursue that career, but I wasn‚Äôt ready to start studying (heavily depressed and confused during COVID and felt pressured by my friends and family to start studying) I started Dental school but I was so miserable at the time I blamed it strictly on the school and that it‚Äôs a shitty job to pursue. I saw that the grass is greener on the medical school side so I worked extremely (really fucking hard) and convinced myself this is what I wanted. After a few thousands of dollars I got accepted and moved to the medical program at my school. (I study in the middle east). After a year and after I got my shit together in life I understood the mistake I‚Äôve made and the reasons why I made the change became clearer. I can go back to Dental school but I‚Äôm so fucking scared, how would my peers react for making the switch again, getting friends once again with new people, I‚Äôll be doing 8 years of school and not 6 and see all my former classmates graduating 2 years before me and I‚Äôll be almost 30 once completing dental school.

191wvei,Anxiety,2024-01-08,Switching meds and regretting it,"About 9 months ago, I started lexapro for debilitating anxiety. It took some time to get used to, but it worked perfectly after a month or so, and I found myself coming out of a depression I didn‚Äôt even know I was suffering from. However, about a month ago I noticed I was feeling depressed; having no interest in doing anything, feeling irritable and tired, withdrawing myself from the people around me, not wanting to play with my kids, etc. I‚Äôm a SAHM so the last part was big for us all, and I reached out to my provider to ask if I should up my dose. They instead changed my script to bupropion and I started it 4 days ago after weaning off the lexapro. I‚Äôve been at a half dose (150mg) for that time, and my anxiety is worse every day. Today it feels like pure panic. I‚Äôm making up scenarios, have been convinced my children are dying and I don‚Äôt know about it, and just convinced myself my husband is leaving me (he‚Äôs not). This feels like the biggest mistake of my life right now. I feel exactly as constantly panicked as I did before I started lexapro and I don‚Äôt know how to live like this anymore. Now that I know life without this sense of doom, dread, and panic, I can‚Äôt stand living this way. Has anyone ever switched meds, experienced something similar?


TLDR; I‚Äôm switching from lexapro to bupropion per my provider‚Äôs advice because I had breakthrough depression and experiencing debilitating panic."

191v6ax,Anxiety,2024-01-08,Time for a new job due to anxiety? Need your advice please.,"**TLDR: Involuntarily moved to another role that I was unprepared for (and 100% would have not taken) that lead to a panic attack and development of anxiety disorder. Been trying to manage the anxiety ever since but feels stuck/lack of progress towards anxiety free life. Thinking about changing job but afraid the new job may make my anxiety worst.**  
  
  
  
Hi, I developed an anxiety disorder in 2021 and have been trying to manage it for the past 3 years. My feeling right now is my current job/company is the main driver. I feel like as long as I'm with this company, I will continue to have a disorder/dysfunction due to anxiety and need a change of scenery.  
  
Long story short, back in 2021 I was involuntarily switched to a brand new team and a new manager. The new role/team would be responsible for high-stakes work with the goal of savings the company millions of dollars. Its a very narrow line of work with all-in focus on cost savings analytical work. Prior to 2021, my work was very diverse and did not involve high stakes work. It was a complete change of work that I wasn't ready for.  
  
Here's a a timeline run-down of how things went:  
  
The other analyst brought into the new team changed jobs immediately (1 month after the team was formed). The person hired as the replacement changed jobs after a few months. This bullet is important because that leaves me as the only analyst doing the analyses, preparing PowerPoints, managing projects, and dealing with data issues (basically the role of 2-3 analysts). Another analyst was hired but guess what, that person decided to move to another role in our department less than 2 years after. Which again leaves me as the only analyst.  
  
One Friday in 2021, I had a meeting with my new manager to go over one of the project and there were questions/concerns about the data/#s. Apparently, one of my colleague (in the new team) was already sharing the #s even thought it was only in draft form (there was no discussions that this was ready to be shared). I had my first ever panic attack after the meeting that extended to Saturday and Sunday.  
  
Ever since that Friday 2021, I've been having very challenging battles with anxiety and trying to manage it. I wake up every morning with increased heart rate, thoughts about deadlines instantaneously raises my body temperature, constant rumination about work, and overall poor state of mind.  
  
I started seeing a mental health counselor in 2021. I went on anti-depressant in 2021 (I went off it since late 2022). I took the necessary steps to manage my anxiety disorder.  
  
Beginning 2023, I was moved to another team but would still be doing the same cost-savings work. So really no change in my mind.  
  
I've spoken openly to my new manager about my anxiety disorder and its challenges to me. I expressed desire to change my role in our 1x1 discussions and after \~10months, I will be finally off-loading some of my cost-savings work to another colleague. However, I'll still be working on a major cost-saving project that has a goal of saving millions of dollar. This is currently driving my anxiety (I just don't feel comfortable taking on this type of high-stakes project).  
  
Here I am right now typing this post trying to rationale to myself what my next step is. My confidence level is at an all-time low and I'm not sure my reasoning to change job is sound/logical. There's lots of good things about my current company (colleagues, benefits, pay) but the work I'm responsible for is absolutely giving me anxiety. There's also the fear that it isn't always greener on the other side which is holding me back from making the job change."
191v00n,Anxiety,2024-01-08,I NEED HOPE AND HELP!!!,"I have spent months obsessively reading posts about different kinds of meds, side effects and others experiences with them. This has left me absolutely terrified to start a med. I have never taken a med before but it's clear I need help (I have a therapist and med dr) but I feel like this whole med thing is such a huge risk. 

I am experiencing GAD, OCD, PTSD, Depression, Irritation and Agigtation, Intrusive Thoughts, Rumination, Fear and Terror Feelings, Insomnia and a Inner restlessness. 

After typically only getting 1 to 6 hours of sleep in which my body feels restless the entire time (like full body RLS) I wake up daily with instant dread, vibrating and heaviness in my chest, constant feeling of anxiety and restlessness, total lack of appitite, my entire body/jaw tensed up tight and my muscles twitch. I don't know how to get out of this state. I DO NOT get crazy racing heart or panic attacks, instead I have a constant feeling of pure anxiety and dread, heaviness, depression/crying spells, constantly looping/intrusive thoughts, things irritating me so easily. I cry because I just feel such despair. I cannot connect or find joy in things anymore. This came on with a flip of a switch in Septemeber. I have a husband and a 5 year old son who I feel like I am failing. I can't live like this. 

Although I want to sit on my couch and do nothing because I feel so horrible with these physical and mental sensations... I'm still getting out of the house and doing things. I don't have panic attacks driving or going places (so its not like agoraphobia) Im taking my son places... it's just VERY uncomfortable the entire time because of this heavy constant anxiety and my body feeling like it wants to run from itself. I do things to distract myself but that's all I ever do now. Cleaning isn't to clean, it's to try and NOT FEEL LIKE THIS. It does feel like my nervous system is on a hairpin trigger. My thoughts and simple things on TV make me feel like my body reacts. 

At my worst, I have periods that feel like episodes where I wasn't sleeping a single minute at night, I was pacing my house like I was on meth, I couldn't sit still, all of my emotions turned off, I was constantly on my phone looking for solutions (I still do that) and feeling like I want to jump off a roof. These somehow settle down and I am left in this state. Bi Polar has been ruled out by professionals. 

When I look on these reddits, I feel like I relate more to the horrible side effects that people experience when starting the meds (in regards to my physical and mental state) and not the initial reason people start the meds. I feel like my nervous system is fried and that I am in is such a bad place and I am scared to make this any worse. 

Can ANYONE relate to this and have meds helped? I'm in such a desperate place! I need help!"

Like, yeah, a forty second voice conversation in exchange for very affordable transportation definitely isn't unreasonable, but I hate it anyway.

I can't afford to live in a city where everything's nearby because I really, really struggle to work full-time. I get panic attacks and shutdowns. So I'm in a tiny rural small town and have to get rides from strangers if I want to leave the house to go to work or the store or a movie theater/library which just doesn't make going out very fun."

it feels like i‚Äôm watching their every move and cant enjoy their company because all i‚Äôm doing is thinking about the mess they‚Äôre making. my friend came over the other day to watch a movie and we had popcorn while on the couch and i couldn‚Äôt stop looking over to make sure she wasn‚Äôt getting crumbs anywhere, and i had to physically stop myself from picking up the tiniest of kernels that landed on the couch 

i hate that i make such an unwelcoming environment, who wants to go over someone‚Äôs house only to be watched like a hawk? 

i know i can just clean when they leave, it‚Äôs not a big deal, but if i don‚Äôt clean it in the moment or tell them to be careful then i start resenting them and getting annoyed then have to spend the rest of the time trying not to show that i want to kick them out of my house so i can clean their mess

When I was still in school at aged 13 or 14, there were two brothers who were the big bullies in the school. They were the most awful teens at the school and didnt like anyone that was different from them.  
Once during swim class at the public pool, on of the brothers saw me getting changed out of my underwear to put my swim shorst on, and proceeded to tell all the other boys that I had a wonky penis because it curves slightly to the left.   
And another time while I was using the bathroom at the urinals in school, one of the brothers came in and saw me and told everyone he could that I had a pointy penis because I am uncircumszied.  Both brothers were circumsized and told everyone about it all the time. They were know as the Cut Twins in our school.   
  
Untill the day I left school at 16 I was called Pointy Penis or Wonky Wang. Along with Hoodie Dick, Curvy Cock and Foreskin Freak.  
  
Its led me to have serious confidence issues about my penis, and has caused me to have a serious anxiety about my foreskin. I dont like pulling it back infront of anyone, and I havnt scince I was 16. Not even doctors or my ex fiancee. I just get an overwhelming fear of rejection, what if they laugh at me, what if they dont like me after, what if they tease me about it, what if something touches me and it hurts, what if my penis gets dirty while my foreskin is pulled back. I get so anxious and worked up that I cannot pull my foreskin back infront of anyone. Only by myself, and even then it takes alot of effort when washing my penis for example, and I dont like pulling it back for long.

I have been teaching for many years and been teaching this one class in particularly for 4 months. They are my tutor group and they are silent and perfectly behaved. Never been an issue. Strangely enough during my first lesson back with them in the new term last week I had a sudden surge of emotion,my heart was beating fast and I felt like I was about to cry but just about managed to avoid it before putting on a video to distract myself and the class. I taught fine for the rest of the day with other more difficult classes. If then happened again in Friday morning and after a restful weekend it happened again this morning. 

I am now very concerned already about tomorrow. They are nice but they are teenagers and there a few students in there that would never let me live it down and spread the news around school if I suddenly cried. I'm looking for advice on how to avoid this situation tomorrow. 

I even took chamomile tea today and drank lots before that first lesson but it did nothing.

Or do they just knock you out? I'm already tending to all the ""clean"" remedies (clean living, exercise, good sleep, positive hobbies, Wellbutrin which I know is chemical but I'm putting in a different category because it is daily and the effects are not instant) but still get an inexplicable sense of unease/dread/nervousness/fear out of the blue.

191plkl,Anxiety,2024-01-08,I need guidance about anxiety medication.,"Hi everyone,

I have been considering anxiety medication for a minute now. I usually wouldn't consider drugs to make myself feel better, though I'm concerned about my mental health. I have just started a new semester in school and am worried about my health.

I don't usually get panic attacks that often but I have multiple test heavy classes this semester. Some of the symptoms I face when stressed.

-Struggling to breath
-Insomnia/poor sleep quality
-stomach aches/issues (can last several hours)
-Constant rumination.
-Panic attacks
-Feeling ill (in the most dramatic way possible, what I imagine cancer feels like).

I feel like it's obvious I should seek some form of medical professionalism or help. But anyone who has taken anxiety meds or done therapy, will I see any changes in my life? I have never struggled in school and know that I will probably be ok this semester. But is there anything I can do to alleviate this feeling of impending doom?

The store owner wanted to talk to me so I think he‚Äôs gonna call me back soon and I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs that he wants me to work more hours cause I‚Äôm not working much this week and I‚Äôm sure he needs the help. 

The place is such a hot mess, it‚Äôs so overwhelming that I feel I‚Äôm going to have a crisis or freak out and be unable to cope while I‚Äôm there. I don‚Äôt even work that many hours but the environment with no breaks and running out of everything is destroying me.

I haven‚Äôt been able to go to therapy in a month. Yesterday I had the day off but I spent the entire day extremely stressed. I only got 4 hours of sleep last night.

 Saturday, I couldn‚Äôt stop sobbing when I got in the car and I couldn‚Äôt sleep after work until 8am and I had dreams about work constantly.

I don‚Äôt know what to tell my boss when he calls in a bit, I just feel so overwhelmed, I make like 13 an hour plus tips, im not in it for the money, I just feel incredibly guilty about the situation the store owner is in."

191nxdp,Anxiety,2024-01-08,How did taking medication help with you anxiety?,"I am curious how exactly taking a pill helps with social anxiety. Does it relax to the point where you feel high? Do you have better conversations? Are you more talkative? Do you overthink and worry less when taking the medication? Is your ""internal dialogue"" less talkative lol.   
  
I have always been a shy/anxious person and when I went off to college I had a couple of panic attacks. I never got on any medication for my anxiety, instead I learned to deal with it the best I can. I am out of college now and probably overthink everything more. Conversations are still hard, I constantly try to plan out conversations in my head even though they are happening in front me. ""What to say next, What are they going to say, What tone should I reply in, Should I smile or laugh."" I get socially drained the more conversations I have a day. I suck at having conversations because I am constantly in my head. I feel like my anxiety makes learning inside my job difficult and just overall being a functional employee during meeting or regular conversations.  
  
I don't know if this is more of an ADHD problem or an anxiety problem, but I am exhausted of how much I overthink everything. It has gotten to the point where most days are hard to ""learn/deal with it"".  
  
I am wanting to get on medication and was curious what has worked the best for everyone? Obviously I will talk with a doctor after this. I have read that Sertraline/Zoloft is good and Adderall/Vyvanse. One of my coworkers even told me he got on Testosterone and it increasingly helped his social anxiety. (I think that was more of a confidence booster rather than anxiety) What would yall recommend to do."

I (21M) have been diagnosed with GAD and OCD for 3 years now and have been trying to work on my mental and phsycial health for the last 2 years taking myself on walks and doing exercises at home but for a long time have desired improving my physical fitness further.

I have a gym near me I have been meaning to go to for since i moved here (5 months ago) but am quite frankly terrified of going there, not only because people I know will be there, but also because I have absolutely no clue what im doing. 

I have a workout plan in mind and know how the different machines work and all that but for every other aspect of it am completely at a loss.

If anyone had any similar experiences and has some advice about how to get over that first step and just set foot in the building that would be greatly appreciated!

Have a wonderful day guys :)"

191lavx,Anxiety,2024-01-08,High adrenaline/anxiety following bad flu. Possible connection?,"Hello, everyone! I hope this post finds you in great mental and physical health.

I am writing this entry to see if anyone else has some insight to offer regarding my situation. 

I suffered a nasty flu just over two weeks ago and have honestly not felt the slightest bit myself since. Although my physical symptoms have mostly resolved (aside from a lingering cough), I have experienced a tremendous amount of anxiety during and following this infection. Prior to this event, I was able to manage my anxiety very successfully for years without medication or therapy. I did, however, experience ‚Äúepisodes‚Äù beforehand where my anxiety was more severe for periods of time. I was able to overcome them gradually with time and lifestyle adjustments. 

This time, however, my anxiety has become simply unbearable. I am experiencing what I would call near constant ‚Äúadrenaline surges‚Äù in which I am unable to calm down effectively. I am trembling, shaking, and internally vibrating quite often. It has greatly affected my daily activities and ability to rest. My OCD tendencies have also returned to an exceptional degree that I am simply crushed by. I have not felt this restless in years. It feels as though someone has ‚Äúflipped a switch‚Äù in my brain, so to speak. 

For what it‚Äôs worth, I do have a history of severe chronic infections stemming from childhood. I eventually got my tonsils removed at age 8 and had ear tubes installed to help alleviate said infections as well.

I have also suffered from anxiety since I was practically a toddler (hereditary), but not to this extent.

Any advice or feedback you may have would be greatly appreciated! Thank you for taking the time to read my entry. Great health and happiness to you all!

P.S. I am currently in the process of consulting my GP about my situation. I do hope to find some answers soon so that I may return to a state of well-being once again."

This relapse has been so sudden it has left me shocked, because i thought i was being able to manage my life and turns out one big anxiety attack later my body is stuck on freeze response.

  
I used to love my life and i was constantly thinking how lucky i was and how happy i was, i loved going out with my friends, loved going to uni and loved living in general. I was constantly going out of my comfort zone but being able to manage the general underlying anxiety.

  
Now that everything has come to a halt because of anxiety, i should want my life back without a doubt, right? Well..... i'm having kind of overwhelming feelings, i used to be happy but i know that right now with all the symptoms i have it's gonna be difficult going out to eat with my friends (for example). Like i think about all the work and hard times i had to go through (when i was deep in the anxiety hole years ago) and i don't know if i have it in me. Why do i feel overwhelmed and uninterested at the idea of getting my life back when it was the happiest i've ever been?

Hi,

i am new here and i wanted to ask how can i cope with the thoughts in my head. When something i am looking forward to or something important takes place on the next day i cant't stop thinking about if i can sleep tonight or not. The problem is that something in my mind says you have to sleep know or else something physically will happen to you tomorrow like a heart attack or epilepsy. I had to struggle with anxiety for a long time also anxiety of dying so thats not new to me. I take sleep to seriously and cant fall asleep because i stress myself about sleeping. When i have nothing to do on the next day i can sleep perfectly but if something i classify as important which can also just be a birthday of a colleague in the evening i just cant fall asleep.

Looking forward to your advice. Thanks !"
191k0ti,Anxiety,2024-01-08,Are these still just physical anxiety/stress symptoms?,"I (33m) have been battling with stress and anxiety for years due to some trauma in my life, it got so bad that I developed quite bad physical symptoms. Now I have been taking sertraline since the end of October (gradually titrating upwards from 50ml to 150ml) and while many of the symptoms have gone (especially shaking, general sensation of feeling unwell, dry throat, blocked sinuses, facial pressure and spasms) some still remain for example brain fog and difficulty concentrating, a bit of tinnitus, a bit of dizziness/feeling off difficulty sleeping.

I feel like it's relevant to mention that I did a blood test checking vitamin levels, electrolytes, thyroid function,, blood etc and it was all normal apart from the fact that my iron levels were a bit high. 

My gp insists that this is normal that I still have these symptoms and it's all connected to the anxiety and should get better, what do you think?"

191iwps,Anxiety,2024-01-08,my dad cheated,"my dad cheated and thinks he can tell my mom that he wants to divorce her

so this is a really weird story ik but let me tell it from the beginning. 
my dad and mom have been married seventeen years now and have me my little sister and little brother. my dad around two years ago started being just super weird and distant and rude and angry and mean to the whole family and it was around the time when i stared going through a really tough time mentally. 

i‚Äôm sixteen and it started the beginning of my sophomore year and it was just awful, it got bad enough to a point where i was cutting myself and couldn‚Äôt even get out of bed to go to school. my dad would beat me for this and my mom would sometimes beat me too, my dad was always worse though he‚Äôd pick me up by my hair and throw me off my bed and stuff it was just the worst year of my life. 

so about three months ago this lady texted my mom and told her that my dad was married to her and that she had a kid and was expecting another kid and my mom went absolutely ballistic on my dad, my dad denied it at first and wouldn‚Äôt give my mom the phone for hours as they screamed and broke everything upstairs, me and my siblings were all in my sisters bed just listening to it. it got bad enough the next day with their fighting that they both hit each other and my mom called the police on my dad, the police just talked to both of them and sort of told my mom to get a restraining order and that they couldn‚Äôt do anything and my dad just left the house to go to work at the restaurants, 
oh yeah this is important so my parents own two businesses, restaurants, that they work at. technically my dads an engineer er but he says ‚Äúhe doesn‚Äôt want to work for anybody‚Äù. 
so the police left and we were just sort of taking it all in we had two half siblings and my dad had been cheating with a whole other wife for two years. the thing is my mom can‚Äôt divorce him for another three years minimum because their visa or greencard is connected and if they get divorced then the green card will expire and we‚Äôll all be sent back to saudi and my mom and we don‚Äôt want that because we‚Äôve lived here our whole lives. 

my dad said nasty things to my mom and still says them but my mom has like made a plan to trick him into thinking she forgave him and that she wants to work out the marriage because he put everything under his name 
the house both the businesses which btw were my moms she worked in them day and night and put all the effort into them. he bought the other wife a range rover and took her to florida 
and i forgot to add this too but this lady was an employee at the resteraunt my parents hired because she was homeless and lived in a shelter and apparently had three abusive husbands so my mom hired her to help her have a fresh start. this lady is also like insane she abused her last husbands and she would scream at my dad and ig h she held a knife up to his throat once too but he still didn‚Äôt ever leave her. 
he did leave her when my mom found out bc apparently he made a fucking deal with her that if she ever told my mom he would divorce her. 

and also he gave me the other wives broken up kia soul when he bought her the range and i was super happy because like i thought he really got me a car and stuff, but it was really just the other wives old car. when he divorced her he took the car back from her and gave it to me but when he got home with the car and saw my mom crying he screamed at my mom and said this is my wife and i had to spoil her 

oh and he also bought the other wife an apartment and gave her over six hundred thousand dollars while me and my mom and siblings have been saving money for two years and not spending it on anything other then necessities bc my mom told us my dad was going through a struggling time and we didn‚Äôt have that much money but he was really just giving it to the other fucking wife 

for the past three months he‚Äôs been mentally abusing my mom and calling her crazy and telling her to stop talking about it he gives her these strikes before he says he‚Äôs going to divorce her 

and just the other day he was screaming at my mom for crying and saying if she doesn‚Äôt leave the room which is literally her room he would divorce her right then. he tells my mom that she was useless and he could never talk to her and she was only sometimes good for him to have sec with and he just says these horrible terrible disgusting things to her. 

let me tell u about my mom now. my mom pretty much raised us our whole lives oh yeah my dad also said she did a terrible job with us even though he was never home but anyways my mom put us in every sport and activity and drove us there and back and still came home and she worked at the restaurant and came home to make dinner for us every night she‚Äôs the most loving sweet caring and kind person you could ever think of. 

i feel like i‚Äôve been sort of carrying the whole house for the last couple of weeks and i already had anxiety before but it‚Äôs just so bad now it‚Äôs gotten to the point where i can‚Äôt eep any food down but i really want to be there for my mom and just my siblings and everyone and idk what to do it‚Äôs so hard living and pretending to love and like my dad because we can‚Äôt show him that we don‚Äôt or he‚Äôll really divorce my mom and break the family and all of our lives pretty much. 

at the beginning he would tell my mom to go back to saudi to her parents because he was such a bad person and trying to guilt trip her and stuff but me and my mom think he just wanted her out of the house so he could bring his other wife to our house and for her to live here. 
oh i also forgot to metntion like a week after my mom found out he said he was going to kill himself and we had to call the police and we were like speeding driving around the city to find him and we literally thought he died but he was just faking it 

it just breaks my heart seeing my mom have to live through this and i really don‚Äôt know what to do . he took five thousand dollars of my parents house cash stash and we think he bought her some used car and he‚Äôs been going to her house in the middle of working me and my mom know because he‚Äôs he put a tracker in his car he also used 100k of my moms money to buy the other wife the range rover i honestly just can‚Äôt believe that his disgusting lady literally came from a shelter and my dad did this so yeah"

Still that sleepiness doesn‚Äôt go away. 

I‚Äôve also been very emotional, crying days in a row/having that burning feeling in my eyes, trying to keep myself together. While I‚Äôve always been a very sensitive/sentimental person, it wasn‚Äôt often that I cried.

I want to watch or read something to take my mind off of things, I can‚Äôt (focusing is really hard).

I barely eat anything when I used to have quite a good appetite.

I can‚Äôt even be bothered to go outside or meet up with friends when I used to every week.

I used to be someone who made their bed every day and I can‚Äôt even do that anymore, just feels like it isn‚Äôt worth the effort.

I should mention that while I always was an anxious person who overthinked every minuscule thing, I still tried to be positive, had some energy, ate a lot, participated in things I enjoyed and (tried) to look on the bright side.

I think the cause of these recent events is attributed to one main factor; I‚Äôm starting my very first job in a completely new country in a short time.

I‚Äôve been stewing in my own thoughts all day, thinking about worst case scenarios, how I‚Äôm going to do certain things in a country where I don‚Äôt know how to (I‚Äôve never been the type of person to go with the flow, I always like to be prepared, have back up plans and be in control), the disruption in my routine, the intense budgeting I‚Äôm going to have to do, if I made the right choice or not, the homesickness I already feel, the feeling like it‚Äôs the point of no return and how much I‚Äôm going to miss my family, friends, pets, home and country (I currently live with my family and close with them, while I was alone in another city for Uni it wasn‚Äôt that far away and I still had friends and that familiarity I was used to).

I hope I came to the right place as it is my first time posting on somewhere like this and I don‚Äôt know where else to go, I‚Äôm feeling very helpless lately and like I‚Äôm overreacting (many people my age do these things but they don‚Äôt get stressed out as easily as I do).

191hyof,Anxiety,2024-01-08,"My anxiety has made my life a living hell, any meds besides Xanax to take?","Hey all, (this is going to be a long post, I‚Äôm asking for med advice but also ranting so if you don‚Äôt want to read this then that‚Äôs totally fine) 

As you can read from the title my entire life has literally been a living hell with this intense form of anxiety that I have. I‚Äôm only 19 and my psychiatrist said that I have the worst form she‚Äôs seen in a while in a young person. So I feel hopeless. I‚Äôm currently on my first day of Effexor and I‚Äôm taking propranolol but I just feel like this isn‚Äôt going to help me as much as I need it to. I get heat flashes, sweats, my whole body shakes, racing thoughts, and panic attacks almost every single day. From the second I wake up, until the entire night, and I never get enough sleep, maybe 5 hours at most and then I‚Äôm jolted awake by my anxiety again. I have a highly addictive personality so I can‚Äôt go on Xanax. I literally got addicted to weed for 2 years straight, smoking out of a gravity bong and going through 20 bowls a day from the moment I was awake, til I fell asleep. I also am dealing with a bunch of diagnoses such as OCD, BPD, Tourette‚Äôs and CPTSD, so I‚Äôm greatly fucked in every way. My BPD makes me think such horrible and hateful thoughts about the people I love, my OCD makes me obsess and confess every thought, including the intrusive ones, and my Tourette‚Äôs get worse with these thoughts. And on top of that my hypochondria makes me almost faint every time I have pain somewhere. It‚Äôs currently 5 am and I still can‚Äôt sleep, so life has been hell lately. I also can never eat from this anxiety. Sorry for the rant, I just don‚Äôt know what the hell to do now. I‚Äôve tried distractions, I‚Äôve tried telling people my thoughts, I‚Äôve tried journaling for years, my therapist is exhausted from me constantly messaging her, and my boyfriend is hurt by my horrible thoughts. My friends are tired of me too, and I just want to be numb forever, I don‚Äôt care if I feel happiness, I just want to stop my brain. Thank you for reading this, any advice or recommendations for meds would be greatly appreciated."
191hv4k,Anxiety,2024-01-08,Bad anxiety following car crash,"Hey all, new here. TW: post involves discussion of a head-on traffic collision. Be advised.

Anyway, a few weeks ago I was involved in a collision which was deemed not my fault by both CHP and insurance. Long story short, it was 10:15pm in the Sierras of NorCal, I was headed out to see a buddy as it was the last day of school preceding Christmas Break (I'm a school employee). I was about a mile from home on a 2 lane undivided road, headed toward the freeway. The roads here are moderately windy, unlit, and see snow for 3-6 months of the year. It was dark, foggy (1000ft), and the roads were damp from the day's rain. I was behind another car going 30mph in a 40 due to visibility. Coming up to a blind curve, I notice the glare of oncoming headlights. Suddenly, the car in front swerves, narrowly avoiding a head-on with the oncoming car in my lane, leaving me with 1 second to react. I took the collision head-on and airbags deployed. I suffered a broken right wrist because of it. The driver turned out to be extremely drunk and unable to perform Field Sobriety Tests beyond the HGN. She was uninjured and subsequently booked into county jail for felony DUI causing injury following a blood tox.

My issue I face now is because this road is so close in proximity to my home and it's the route I must take to go anywhere, I am reminded each time I leave the house of that night. I can no longer drive without being constantly on edge until I get to the freeway or back home. I am a school bus driver and routinely drive these types of roads, on average 110mi per day. I also commute 20mi to work each way. I cannot live like this, but I have yet to find a way to get over the constant anxiety I feel when driving. I went from someone who loved to go out and do things to someone who fears leaving the comfort of my home. I feel anxious each time I step into the garage and see my other un-wrecked car, because just the thought of driving makes me get a small adrenaline rush. I lay awake some nights with the events replaying in my head without control, causing me to lose sleep. Although I've tried to get back out on the road and reduce my anxiety by reminding myself that those events are highly unlikely, it seems there's a little voice telling me that it's bound to happen again. 

I more or less needed a space to write out how I'm feeling, but I also ask if anyone has tips to make this easier to deal with. I plan on seeking help as this anxiety is detrimental to the safe performance of my job, and greatly reducing my quality of life. If you read this far, thank you. I hope in the end that things turn out better, and I plan to pursue a career in which I can remove these selfish people from the road before hurting someone else like I was, or worse."
191hk98,Anxiety,2024-01-08,Can hallucinations be caused by anxiety?,"I have been on Xanax .25mg for about 4 months now and aurorix 600mg. No change in my medication recently. 
Yesterday I was sitting in my room and my shelves caught my attention. I swear they were getting bigger. I watched the shadow which also felt like it was getting bigger/closer to me. Obviously I know it didn't happen but it kinda fucked with me, I swear that's what I saw. 
I watched the shelves for like 10 minutes and they kept doing it. Getting bigger, then they suddenly got normal again just to get bigger again. 
I lay down and went to sleep. Couldn't fall asleep, I have tapestry on my bed (it's a bunk bed so the tapestry is on the wall and above me on the bottom of the top bunk). It was dark and I felt like the tapestry kept getting closer. 
I was scared and felt pretty panicky, I don't know when I fell asleep but it was probably around 3am. 
Today I keep seeing something out the corner of my eye. I have a huge headache, feel tired and confused. 
Can that be caused by anxiety? I had depression, anxiety and ocd diagnosed when I was 12 (I'm 21 rn) and have been on different pills since then. 
This has never happened to me, not even when I was doing so much worse than I'm now. Not that I'm doing super good now, but it was worse. 
I have been feeling paranoid/anxious lately. 
I was supposed to see my therapist today but he cancelled and it made me cry because I really feel unsafe rn. 
What can it by caused by?"

I [22F] have been diagnosed with a UTI around four months ago, got prescribed antibiotics. I took the full course and went back, apparently I still had it. Took another different antibiotic full course. Over time, my stomach pain has gotten more severe. I can barely eat anything anymore without flair ups. It seems like I randomly and suddenly became intolerant towards gluten and lactose, which I never had a problem with before. Really horrible acid reflux. Fast forward to now, I had to go to the hospital for these stomach pangs and food intolerance just for them to conclude that *nothing* was wrong with me except for the fact that I had a UTI. The same UTI??
During this time, I'm developing cysts all over my body and I'm freaking out at this point. I'm always in pain, I'm exhausted. I'm losing sleep. I've been ill for around five months now and I'm deeply terrified of going into septic shock. I just came out of the hospital around a week ago with nothing prescribed and I feel like I'm going insane. I don't know what to do anymore. I've gotten two MRIs, an ultrasound, papsmear, and bloodwork. At this rate, it feels like my doctors are going to let me pass away. Is there anyone here who can bring me any comfort or advice?

191g8oi,Anxiety,2024-01-08,How to help a teenage girl learn how to destress,"I 29m live with my boyfriend and his family, and his brother's girlfriend also lives here. She is 16f, and in the early stages of pregnancy. She gets stressed out so easily, and shuts down. I know with pregnancy there are hormones changing her emotions, but still, she is incredibly sensitive. 

I know her home life was probably a big factor in her anxiety, and she used to get bullied in school. She was homeschooled during middle school, it was because of the bullying, but her mom is also a narcissist helicopter parent. She doesn't believe her daughter can do anything, and if she learned to do anything it was because she didn't love her mom, and her mom always made it all about her. her dad on the other hand was a know it all kind of narcissist. He would never admit to being wrong, would let everyone know he was smarter than everyone, and had a very questionable way of parenting. He is the one who kicked her out when she got pregnant to ""learn how to be an adult"".

so this girl is full of anxiety. She can't handle any criticisms, or anything going wrong slightly, and she always takes blame, and then shuts down. I was trying to help her with her homework, and I very calmly said, ""oh look here, do you see your mistake"", and she apologized and called herself all different words for stupid, and I told her it was only a mistake, and she wouldn't talk after that. After trying to get her to feel okay for 20 minutes, she said she just wanted to go to her room. Also when we went out to get fast food, they were out of something, so my boyfriend didn't get everything he wanted. So she blames it on herself, and apologizes to him. she then tries to give him all of her food and said she didn't need anything. We practically had to force her to eat her own food, and the she apologizes again for making everything worse. then she hid in her room for hours.

I just feel like she has never been taught a healthy way to deal with stress. Her only coping mechanism is to shut down and hide, and i think she could be much happier if she learned the skill, but I'm not sure what that skill is or how to teach it."

I noticed my vision was very slowly starting to return to normal, and I was finally able to see to google some things. It only took a few minutes to learn that the antihistamine in hydroxyzine can make your vision blurry when you wake up because it can dry out your eyes.

191cm1e,Anxiety,2024-01-08,Anxiety feeling crippling,"Crippling work and social anxiety #help

33F, and long story short I had a shittt child hood. I don‚Äôt like to talk about it because I was told everyone has a story. I grew up in foster care, adopted by a family friend who treated me like crap and was abusive. Ended back in foster care as a kid, bounced around for years and then was out of my own from very young. Have countless post traumatic stress situations I can recall that have caused me such panic and trauma. More to the story but you get the jisp.

My entire life has been fight or flight, I have battled anxiety and depression. More so anxiety in my adult hood. My anxiety has gone through stages but over the past 5-7 years my anxiety has been taken a bad turn every single year getting worse. 

I went from having panic attacks every now and then to having them daily. 

I managed to go to college, get a degree, work my way up in corporate. Make a great living for Myself, have a husband and a dog and a beautiful home and life together.

But my anxiety has gotten to a point for me that it feels crippling. I have constant worry about the future as in minor things, worried about a meeting I have at work, what will people think when I say something, did I say something wrong, I go over a conversation or an email over and over again for weeks upon weeks it‚Äôs sickening. Constantly worrying about how I came Off, if I sounded stupid.

I have a hard time paying attention, often frantic about these things all day that I started to make mistakes in work over the last few years and some of these mistakes still haunt me. I‚Äôm constantly second guessing every little tiny thing I do for work. This goes on socially as well, with people that are acquaintances, or my in law family.

 I cut back on drinking to barely nothing I mean like once or twice a year because the anxiety is so bad afterword I found it not to be worth it to drink. 

My work anxiety though is by far the worst. I 100% battle with imposter syndrome. And part of it is I can remember things people have said that have made me feel stupid over the years. That of course traces back to my insecurities from childhood of always feeling like I wasn‚Äôt smart, kids made fun of me in school because I never knew the answer when I got called on. But in school I was worrying about having a place to live and not school. 

Then in work I can recall times of people making me feel stupid for not knowing something. Something that doesn‚Äôt even pertain to work. One guy asked me years ago, do I  know what IQ stood for? I said no I don‚Äôt actually. Then he put me down for not knowing this and laughed at me. This was at work. I asked my friend who I think is one of the smart people in my life if she knew what it stood for and she didn‚Äôt. But things like this live on with me forever. Like I said probably traced back to my childhood. I go over situations like this in my head countless times. My confidence is in the drain, it causes me panics throughout my day, and some days I feel crippled in bed or hard to start my day because I‚Äôm constantly worried that I‚Äôm not cut out for work.

I have been in therapy for years. I just moved and have the opportunity to try a different type of therapy for anxiety called EMDR and hoping that helps. 

Idk I‚Äôm looking for advice, anything. Anyone else experience this? Anyone else actually overcome anxiety? I have googled so many things to help, read other stories, read books, tried therapy and countless medications. I feel stuck and sometimes feel like this can‚Äôt be it. There has to be something that can really help. Atleast I hope so. #hell"

Hi, I‚Äôm 21f and have struggled with severe GAD my whole life and symptoms of depression and OCD. My anxiety is preventing me from doing everyday things and functioning like a normal human being. I dont know what other options there are for me. I‚Äôve tried many SSRIs (currently on 60mg Prozac) and am on 0.5mg Ativan as needed. I don‚Äôt think the Ativan helps much but I‚Äôm too scared to take a higher dose because I don‚Äôt want to feel high (I‚Äôve had extreme panic attacks from marijuana use and hate the feeling of being high) and I‚Äôve already been taking it for months so I don‚Äôt want to be addicted. 
I‚Äôm at my wits end with anxiety, I never feel relaxed or relief and this is leading to horrible physical symptoms and depression from my body being in a constant state of anxiety. Has anyone taken antipsychotics for anxiety and have they helped? Or is there any other last resort treatment that has worked for anyone?
Any help is appreciated"
191b9hi,Anxiety,2024-01-08,How to deal with my anxiety?,"Ok. So here goes. Please be kind. I never thought I'd end up writing on Reddit, but I'm desperate. About three years ago, I lost my dad after a short but horrible illness (leukemia + dementia). Thankfully it was fast, but he did suffer. I'm an only child and have no real family support, so I had to be my mom's rock. After he passed, I was numb for about a year, until my dog got sick and had to be hospitalized. He made it, but that week was the worst...crippling anxiety, constantly thinking about my dad, crying in the shower because I just could cope, etc. I can't even put it into words. 
So of course, I started therapy. At first it worked, and I guess it still does, a bit. I went back to school to become a psychologist, I was happier and felt like my life was back on track. But December came rolling in and it all went to hell. Once again, crippling anxiety, terror that something is going to happen to my dog (he's 16 and suffering from arthritis) and just in general a feeling of doom. And now my mom caught some bug and I'm about to lose it. The doctor says she's fine, but I'm staying at her house just in case we have to rush to the hospital like we did with my dad, because my f***ing anxiety says something is going to happen. I can't cope. I think I'm in so much pain that crying isn't really an option for me, it just won't come (until today, which was a first). I'm on clonazepam, but I'm at the point where it's just not helping. Also, I also see my therapist every month now, because I was better. But I'm really not anymore. And I hate this. Thanks for letting me vent, internet strangers. And for reading me."

This was the one of many events no one ever bothered telling me about. My weekend was going fine, in fact I brushed it off seeing the snaps of the party, but it bothered me more than it should.

1919ymd,Anxiety,2024-01-08,Healt anxiety,"Here is my story. In 2015.  I had a misabortion. I fell mentally but I didn't give up, I continued. After that I didn't get pregnant, I went for 6 years of examinations for various tests, and everything was fine, but there was no baby. In 2018.  finally IVF, but unfortunately unsuccessful. Disappointed really. In 2019.  on the second IBF, without any hope, with no faith that it will be... in 3 weeks I have a positive test. Overjoyed and very scared. The whole pregnancy in fear, in panic, every week for an examination because of some panic attack (for which then  I didn't think they were panic attacks).Luckily, she was born with a c-section healthy and alive. Finally happy. Unfortunately, not for long. I got deep vein thrombosis with embolism, I couldn't walk, I was coughing, my leg was swollen... I ended up in the hospital,  luckily I'm coming out alive again. This whole period I'm too strong, yes I cry, but deep down somewhere I believe that everything will be ok. After 3-4 months I start: I have a stomach disease - I'm going to do a blood test and an echo, I have breast cancer  -I go for an echo....so for 1 year until my husband sat me down and told me that this is not right, I only google about diseases. And yes, then I got married. But that didn't change anything, I continued to go every second  a week of examinations for various self-diagnoses with an excuse: here it is now for sure. And it's been like this for 4 years. I tried EFT, it didn't help, I tried talking to a psychologist, it didn't help either... I can't live like this, I know I have a problem  but I can't stop googling and looking for symptoms on my body. Tell me please, how did you overcome your health anxiety?"

191972c,Anxiety,2024-01-08,Anxious teen (16M) increasingly doesn‚Äôt leave the house - how to help?,"Hi everyone. I‚Äôm hoping people whose anxiety has gotten to the point of not going out, or who are/were very anxious as teens, can offer some insight into their thought processes and what works or worked for them. Basically I‚Äôm a parent of a teen in that situation and I‚Äôm struggling with how best to help him.

Both my wife and I have ongoing anxiety issues but our son seems to have got everything we do and more. Over the last few years, post-COVID return to in-class schooling has been hard and assignment/exam anxiety has often been debilitating, causing many missed school days. Many mornings were a battle to get him out of bed. His marks however remain good - not straight As but certainly good enough.

However he has not gone to school at all for the last few months, stemming from some assessments that he struggled with after missing a couple of weeks of school. 

He has been seeing a psychologist and that has been helpful, but over the last few weeks seems to be withdrawing more, avoiding other family members, getting angry more often, and not wanting to go out at all. While he wasn‚Äôt going to school he was at least coming out for family dinners etc but that has stopped and I don‚Äôt think he has left the house in about three weeks. Last night we were going to go out to dinner, but I said the wrong thing and so he immediately refused to go. To me that seemed like any excuse to refuse would have been good enough.

He does still seem to be in contact with friends but has not seen them. They are all similar personalities so organising to go out doesn‚Äôt come naturally to them. But I do hear him talking to them via online gaming.

I‚Äôve been trying to talk to him but get the sense that I am starting to be annoying. Ultimately I‚Äôm a middle aged parent and I can understand a 16 year old not wanting to open up to me. It‚Äôs also hard to know what is anxiety and what is just being a moody teenager. But I am increasingly at a loss as to how to help him, and worry that when school goes back for the year in a few weeks he won‚Äôt be able to bring himself to go.

So - if this is/was you, was there anything that helped you? Were there things that made it worse? Was there something you wished someone would have done for you? And if you recovered from this sort of scenario, how, and how is your life now?

Really appreciate any input and thanks so much if you read this far."

1918hrd,Anxiety,2024-01-08,Anxiety &amp; Sleep advice,"Hi all,  
I have known that I have a fair amount of anxiety for a long time, and possibly depression. However, I get on fine with work and achieving things, I'm happily married, and socialise regularly with friends. What I'm trying to say is, I often rationalise that my anxiety hasn't stopped me from having a full life and therefore doesn't matter. I'm beginning to wonder if I haven't just got used to negating it.  
I recently started another round of therapy. I previously had 12 weeks of therapy due to a very complicated and intense family dynamic and to support me through a difficult time of change. This therapy is being provided by my employer, and when I did the initial assessment quiz they told me I have moderate to severe depression and severe anxiety. I was quite surprised, and spent a long time thinking over my answers wondering if I'd been overly dramatic about anything (which maybe should have told me what I needed to know...).  
I'm trying to be more aware of my mental health and more connected. I know that I go through some spells where I cry a lot, but these are fairly uncommon now I'm older and always pass or is linked to something happening. I do however obsess painfully over very small things constantly. For example, I met an old friend today in the supermarket and in my surprise to see her I gave her a hug. We used to work together, with her as my supervisor and I spent the entire afternoon in deep worry that it was innappropriate to hug her. I find big parties or busy social situations very worrying, and often make up excuses to avoid them. I do love meeting friends for coffee though! I worry about eating meals with them, or being in large groups where I might be sat somewhere awkward, or going for walks in case they think I'm too slow or lazy. I find it easiest in small visits where I feel in control I suppose, and then scurry home.   
I'm beginning to realise that my biggest issues are overeating and sleep. I struggle a lot to sleep and often get up in the night when my stomach is so fluttery and feet are so twitchy it feels like torture to stay in bed. I always thought I was just a bit of a night owl but am beginning to see how things add up.  
Anyone with anxiety experienced very intense butterflies and twitchiness when trying to sleep? Like it's painful to try and lie still? Sometimes you know it's coming, which maybe brings it on more. Any advice?  
Any general advice for this point in my journey? I feel okay, but am beginning to spot ways that I'm maybe not. For context, I had some challenges growing up (racial trauma, poverty, abandoned by Father, single parent Mother who was full of love but struggled with hoarding, undiagnosed ADHD with meltdowns, and intense trauma of her own). I've spoken about all this a lot on therapy. New therapist has suggested speaking to GP about medication but I'm very keen to avoid that if I can. "

I'm having a tough year with anxiety right now. For the past 9 months, I've been taking 100 mg of Zoloft, and now I'm also taking 150 mg of Wellbutrin. Before Zoloft, I tried Buspar, but had side effects that weren't subsiding. 

I wish I could say that the Wellloft mixture was a miracle, but I only feel slightly better. I have so much anxiety about having anxiety, and panic about getting panicky. It's awful. My doctor has given me 10mg of Xanax about every 6-8 weeks for several months now, but she is now reluctant to continue that because I ""should"" be feeling much better with the Zoloft and Wellbutrin. The Xanax is the only thing that truly helps, and even just having the prescription makes me feel better. 

I have propranolol to take as needed, which helps, but it doesn't calm down my brain (and it's not supposed to). Does anyone have suggestions for other medications I could ask for for panic symptoms? I've heard of people taking gabapentin for panic. Does that work or do people have some other suggestions, even off-label ones? Thank you!

I have depression, generalised anxiety disorder and ADHD, all of which i need to be medicated for because of how much they affect my daily life, and even WITH the medication, I am still affected by them every day regardless because medication isn't magic, as we know. I don't understand how with 31 pages of evidence that i sent them of diagnoses, prescriptions, proof that i've been on sleeping pills on and off for years because the anxiety and adhd cause me awful insomnia, and a list of mental health professionals that i'd need more than my own fingers and toes to count on, they've STILL awarded me nothing. This doesn't give me great hope for the appeal/tribunal process, and i honestly have no idea where to start with regards filling in the appeal form. This is especially hard right now whilst having ADHD that's currently unmedicated because of the national medication shortage.  
If any fellow ADHDers, or people with these mental health conditions who've won their appeals could offer any advice, support, zoom call to help me or literally anything, i'd be very appreciative because i'm really stressed about it now, especially as i only have 2 weeks left to appeal because their letter (dated 21st december) only arrived yesterday, so that's already cost me a couple of weeks of my 1 month time limit, which i hardly think is fair.

I‚Äôm getting a PhD following grief so I have a feeling that my seratonin has been wreaked for a few years but I was just numb to it from working so hard all the time until it got to the adrenaline surges to the point of insomnia.

My doctor prescribed me vistaril (hydroxyzine) and oh my goodness I haven‚Äôt felt this normal in months, after one dose. Finally slept through a night.

I‚Äôve never taken SSRIs and have come to realize that I need them desperately (I swore I‚Äôd never go on meds but when wind blowing in a tree triggers you‚Ä¶), however since the vistaril is working so good, should I go on SSRIs? Again I know I‚Äôll talk to a doc tomorrow, but if anyone has any background with this. 

It‚Äôs my understanding that vistaril helps with serotonin levels, so I‚Äôm hoping that means I‚Äôm a good candidate for SSRIs (I‚Äôve seen lexapro is generally well tolerated but again that‚Äôs up to the doc, though I have a few friends good on it so I‚Äôll try advocating for that). It says I can‚Äôt take vistaril more than 4 months which is why I‚Äôm looking for long term use while I finish my program.

I just hope whatever I get works like this because it‚Äôs been so nice not crying over wind in a tree."

I've had tingling in my arms with panic attacks, but this is less of a tingling, more of a sort of spreading coolness. Has anyone else experienced this with anxiety?

1916t4r,Anxiety,2024-01-07,"If Xanax makes my symptoms go away, does that mean that it was all anxiety?","Hello all. I recently have been having a lot of struggles anxiety wise, mostly related to health. I‚Äôve had random moments almost every other day where I feel dizzy, nauseous, lightheaded, tingling sensation all over the body, headaches, etc. When these symptoms really get bad I take .25 mg Xanax that‚Äôs been prescribed to me for Panic Attacks and moments of high anxiety. Within a half hour, my anxiety almost fully goes away, and so do the physical symptoms 95% of the time. 

My biggest question is: if Xanax makes these physical symptoms go away, how likely does that mean that it was all related to anxiety. Has anyone else dealt with anything similar? I currently have more anxiety about my health because of all the physical symptoms, and I‚Äôve sort of become a hypochondriac at times with health anxiety."

Ever since that month i started to get mad easily, short temper, and sometimes i would feel like smiling but i avoid smiling or laughing now since i read its a sign of dementia also the short temper is a sign of dementia,  and the uncontrolable smiling and laughing,
Could this just be anxiety? Im 17 years old i was diagnosed with adhd at the age of 7, and maybe developed more mental disorders like bpd, and ocd"
1916mxf,Anxiety,2024-01-07,I talked myself out of a panic attack,"For the first time in my life I prevented a panic attack. I don‚Äôt get them often, maybe two/three every year, but they make me spiral and it gets so bad I curl up and cry uncontrollably. 

So some background: I went to a psychiatrist 5 months ago for anxiety. (I also now believe I have rejection sensitive dysphoria and have yet to talk to her about that). I walked out being diagnosed with ADHD, depression, and mood swings. I was put on lamotrigine, bupropion, and Ritalin. My psychiatrist told me that my inattentive ADHD is what is causing my anxiety because of overthinking.

I feel so different, less depression symptoms, I don‚Äôt get as snappy or frustrated with people. My thoughts are so calm. It felt weird at first but this is actually how normal people feel! No overthinking! 

So my panic attack came because I had Covid, a UTI, was dehydrated, and on my period. It was a rough time. My boyfriend said the slightest thing and I took it as rejection. I shut down and couldn‚Äôt hold it in. I layed in bed for the night and my mind wouldn‚Äôt stop. It spiraled and I could feel my stomach clenching, my heart ache, and my eyes watering. I was having suicidal thoughts.

I didn‚Äôt want it to get worse so I talked to myself in my head like a friend. I told myself that everything would be okay. What my boyfriend said was just sarcasm. He still loves me. I have a comfy bed to lay in with him. We had such a good day watching movies. I love you. I love myself. There‚Äôs nothing I can‚Äôt do. You‚Äôve been doing so well. The medication has been working and you‚Äôve never been happier. 

It took some time convincing but just like that- my mind listened. I could feel the wave of calm pass over me. It was incredible. It‚Äôs never happened before. 

The next day I talked to my bf about what happened and how I felt and he was very understanding and compassionate. It wasn‚Äôt that I couldn‚Äôt tell him how I felt in the moment, it‚Äôs that I didn‚Äôt want to upset him or make him hate me (which is my rejection sensitive disphoria talking). 

However, that next day was really bad. I cried so much and for no reason. I think it was my body releasing the stress. At least this time my mind was calm and not racing because of the Ritalin. My bf held me and we waited for it to be over. It was really sucky but I know it could‚Äôve been so much worse.

I don‚Äôt know if this is gonna help anybody but it was my experience and I really didn‚Äôt believe the advice from my therapist would work. &lt;3"

If there is a disagreement with a complete stranger: someone being rude over nothing or over something petty. I immediately take the high road while inside to deescalate and I feel a flush of guilt, anxiety, fear as if everyone is watching and I am at the wrong. Once it‚Äôs over, my mind keeps repeating the incident with a what if scenario of what I should have done. Told them they are wrong, fight back etc.. That, in return, makes me get into other conflicts since my mindset is so focused on a negative interaction. If I try really hard I can push through my anxiety to fight or be just as petty once the scenario arises again with someone. I think my fear is social anxiety and embarrassment.

Anyone else have this?"

Yet what I am feeling now takes the cake.

For a few months I felt good, no insomnia or anything serious like that, but during winter break I did experience a crisis related to my self-esteem and spent hours upon hours studying for school and doing work in excess. Tomorrow is the day we go back, and I literally can't. For some reason these couple of days I became consicous of my swallowing when eating, and this evening I became comscious of it all the time. I haven't stopped swallowing since.

Now, dear people of Reddit, would you kindly let me know how can I get out of this mess? How do I stop myself from swallowing and thinking about swallowing? I tried everything yet it doesn't work that much, except for periods of 30 seconds where I forget about it. What is wrong with my brain, and what can fix it? I will soon be sleep deprived on top of all this. Is there a medicine that can somehow stop me from hyperfixating on my swallowing? What can I do to stop it and get some sleep?

hi guys i‚Äôm (19F) currently struggling with some healthy anxiety related to my heart and blood pressure. i had a moment where i stood up after i was bent over a few minutes and my vision got dark, pounding headache, racing heart, and feeling unbalanced. Im back to normal now, but im getting worried about my blood pressure whether it‚Äôs high or low and how that will hurt my overall health ESPECIALLY my heart. i‚Äôve had problems with health anxiety regarding my heart a lot recently and now im convinced that my blood pressure will trigger a heart attack and im sitting here now with a slight headache and my left arm is feeling a little weird so that‚Äôs really doing me in. Mind you i have visited the ER 3 or 4 times in the months of November and December and the did very extensive tests the first time they took blood, urine, chest x-rays, CT scan, and ecg/ekg and nothing scary was happening to me and my chart seemed pretty normal. I have become much better at talking myself down from the big scary heart attack that i‚Äôm definitely not having, but right now i‚Äôm second guessing myself i‚Äôm saying ‚Äúmaybe this time it‚Äôs real what if you talk yourself down but it turns out you were in danger?‚Äù i don‚Äôt know how to get out of that and i can‚Äôt really tell between my physical anxiety symptoms, or if something is really happening to me and it‚Äôs exhausting. i have seemingly been dying from this same heart attack time and time again."
1915pz3,Anxiety,2024-01-07,Had a panic attack and haven't felt right since,"So I (20M) have always struggled a little bit with anxiety throughout school. This lead to drug use and partying. Once i graduated from high school I got clean and sober, and started working on myself. I exercise frequently, and I try my best to get out in the world even though it made me anxious. However, I got a girlfriend about a year ago. She crashed her car in June, and she had me practically live with her so I could take her to and from work every day, while I also worked. Then in August, college started up. 

I was getting about 4 hours of sleep every day, and working 10+ hours a day, then coming home and working on her car, then staying up to do college. This lead to the most massive mental breakdown/panic attack I've ever had. 6+ hours of straight unstoppable panic. I laid at home crying until I was taken to the hospital. They gave me Ativan and I fell asleep. 

I went home and took a week off of work, changed my schedule to only work 40 hours. Got my girlfriends car working, and was able to sleep in my own bed. It took me about a month to recover from the pretty consistent panic attacks. It's been 3 months since the panic attacks have mostly stopped. Now I just have this tense, anxious feeling pretty much all the time. Leaving the house makes me dizzy with anxiety, which is infuriating. I am an extrovert at heart, and want to be with people, but my anxiety has me in shackles.

I tried to take 3 days to go stay in a hotel in a nice mountain town, and all 3 days I had panic attacks at the hotel. I knew this was going to happen, but I wanted exposure therapy to show me that things actually were alright. It didn't seem to work. I just want to know if this will ever go away? Or if my brain has just permanently rewired itself and I will never enjoy going out again. It's been such a struggle to try and do the things I love, and it makes me want to cry. I used to love the feeling of adventure, but now it makes my stomach turn thinking about going anywhere. I'm just curious if there is recovery in my future, or if this is my life now."

I started taking it because my anxiety was turning into a panic disorder and I felt helpless. I've read online that this medication is not meant to be taken for more than 4 months yet my Doctor has chose to keep refilling it for 3 years. The day before yesterday I started having heart palpitations. Really bad heart palpitations. To the point every three beats it would happen and that would last for minutes sometimes. And sometimes when that happens my heart feels like its combining the beats because its going so fast it slows down out of nowhere.. Which is extremely scary. I know this may be due to my anxiety but I'm worried because I've read online that hydroxyzine can cause an irregular heartbeat/other issues. I'm terrified and obviously don't want to keep taking it because of the risks but I'm also scared of what my anxiety is going to do to me if I don't take it.

- Exchanged some pants I got for Christmas that didn't fit me for something I like a lot more. Old me would have just held onto those pants until they inevitably get donated to goodwill. 

I also have (almost) no issues with calling and making medical appointments for myself, something that literally made me cry in my early 20s (and avoid important medical stuff like routine dentist appointments, pap smears, and stuff that just improves my wellbeing overall like therapy, massage, etc.). 

I wanted to make this post because (a) I know this community will understand that these things that are seemingly insignificant to regular people feel like HUGE accomplishments to me, and (b) to encourage people who are struggling and feel like there's no hope to getting better."

Like it‚Äôs hard to meal plan when I get this pain and just want to make it stop. This whole issue is just extremely overwhelming. I‚Äôm also worried that it‚Äôs too late and I‚Äôm going to get type 2 diabetes from this. My dad had type 2 diabetes as well. 

I just want to be healthy but I‚Äôm afraid it‚Äôs too late for me. My doctor also isn‚Äôt taking me seriously so I‚Äôm getting absolutely no help with this. My mom doesn‚Äôt understand. I just feel really alone. I‚Äôm only 19 and really want to be healthy and live my life. I don‚Äôt want to die or have diabetes."

Doctor's have shrugged me off because I've aged out years ago of them giving a damn. So i'm on my own with no support, no positive voice in my head and all I want to do is chuck myself out the nearest window..but I can t' because that would kill my parents and as a Christian, I can't commit suicide.

19129nc,Anxiety,2024-01-07,I know what I'd like to possibly do as a career/extra income but severely struggling to commit,"This is just one of my many problems but the current one I'd like to maybe get some advice on. Without the major backstory the basics is that I have on and off played around with the idea of using my writing degree and love of crafting to run a blog. The niche, so to speak, that I landed on was one dedicated to making closet cosplays or casual cosplays since I know how expensive cosplay is. Something that makes me anxious whenever I think about doing a cosplay ngl, alongside where to store an expensive cosplay since we have a small house.

One of the reasons I also struggle and get panic attacks whenever I try to actually make progress on setting up this dream blog is while I do have a ""craft room"" it's a fucking slob mess and I know presentation is important in blogs and I live in a secluded area so I feel like any photoshoots I'd do might end up having to be in my house. Plus I already struggle with my self image with body dysmorphia sometimes if I see a picture of myself. Doing cosplay has been my way with coping with this, hence why I wanna try to focus on it as a way to better work to overcome this issue. Not only that but with my craft room, whenever I try to figure out where to start cleaning I get overwhelmed and just don't do it.  


My other struggle is trying to even plan content for this blog that I'd like to have set up before I launch to give myself some stuff to post. I only have a few solid ideas, at least imo, since due to my money anxiety (I am very money conscious) I struggle to spend the money to buy the things needed to make a few projects. Granted with my current job, right now I'm making better progress in this field (assuming the comment about me leaving in a month isn't a hint to me getting fired, which is a whole other issue).  


I do wanna try to commit to starting the blog, regardless if it makes money or not, since family members and my therapist think it'd be a good way to help with my massive anxiety and depression. But I still get overwhelmed trying to make any progress and I'm honestly terrified of trying to ask for help over on the r/Blogging subreddit.

Sorry for the long post. Just not really sure who to talk to who might be able to give me solid advice on what to do. Also I struggle with ADHD if that matters

TL/DR: I wanna start a blog about sewing closet/casual cosplays but I'm struggling to commit."
191208u,Anxiety,2024-01-07,Cannot Get Out Of My Own Head,"I will try to make this as short as possible but I truly just need any type of advice / reassurance / unbiased opinions. Anything to let me know that this isn't the end of the world and I will be okay no matter what happens. 

Back in March of 2023 I was laid off for the first time in my career. It was equal parts terrifying and depressing especially because I was living in a super HCOL city and my student loans and other bills are very high. I was lucky enough to find a new position in May of 2023 after applying to over 450 jobs. It was brutal but I made it through, though I took a 30% cut in salary because I really just needed health insurance again and to pay my bills if nothing else. 

Fast forward to today and I am still in my new role which I am enjoying, but it is with a startup and the environment can be a bit volatile. For my end of year review, my manager let me know that work is going to slow down significantly in 2024 and they're going to need me to work on other projects across the organization to fill my time. This makes me so uneasy because what if I'm not good at the new tasks? What if I can't pick up the new work as easily? The question that haunts me -- what if they just end up laying me off again? I want to be in a role where I can feel fulfilled and satisfied and doing meaningful work. I feel like I should start looking for a new job but it all seems so daunting. 

For context: I am a technical recruiter with over 8 years of experience but the job market has been HORRENDOUS over the past 18 months or so. Mass layoffs have been happening across all of the tech industry and when you apply to a role, you're easily competing with thousands of others who are in the same boat. 

I've been having some serious anxiety about work lately. I have very little appetite, not able to sleep and just doom scroll on my phone for hours and hours. It may seem silly, but my biggest fear is not being able to pay my bills and ruining my credit. I know there are more important things in life, but this situation is eating me alive and I truly think I have some sort of PTSD from my layoff last year. I probably should look into therapy because this feeling is consuming me.

Sorry for the huge rant, I just truly am not sure how to feel better at this point. Prior to being laid off, I never had these thoughts or feelings when it pertained to work."

I just had my most recent attack last night and it was straight heart palpitations for 2 hours and I couldn‚Äôt breathe. I tried cold water, magnesium glycinate, finally melatonin kicked in and I passed out.

This will require me to sit on stage for about an hour or so... get the award and give a quick speech.   I am absolutely terrified of this.    It has consumed me for months thinking about it and fearing I will have a massive panic attack... puke... or pass out ( I have never actually passed out from one but it felt like I could).

19113br,Anxiety,2024-01-07,Would buspar be a good option to help with what I am going through? Any advice appreciated,"Would buspar be a good option to help with what I am going through? Any advice appreciated  
I am a 23 year old 6' 160 pound male with anxiety, asthma and have dealt with some post concussion issues in the past,  
Long story short I have had gad and ocd for quite a few years now but during my adult life was able to get it down to where I had a full active life with no significant day to day impediments from anxiety.  
Over the summer I started struggling a lot with asthma/breathing which reignited my anxiety and became a very vicious cycle where the anxiety and asthma brought each other on and continuously made each other worse which caused me to be very avoidant in day to day life. But still my baseline anxiety like when I was home or doing something relaxing outside or etc was fine and many days I was really not too bad at all. Panic/stress was only brought on by very stressful health or real world situations (intense physical exertion, large crowds, oral presentations, dates).  
About 6-8 weeks ago my anxiety exploded seemingly out of nowhere and my baseline anxiety has been suffocatingly bad since then. Its rare that I have days where it goes down below a 6-7/10 even when I am just at home trying to relax. I have constant feelings of despair, fear, panic which manifest as awful physical sensations and I am also always extremely tense, jittery, restless, etc. It is awful.  
I have started therapy again and have been coping with meditation, exercise, benadryl and klonopin 1-2 times per week and have been improving a little bit compared to when this whole thing started a couple months ago but the progress isnt meaningful enough to where I can return to my former life and I am getting desperate because I am starting the next semester of uni in a week and feel like I will have to drop out if I dont improve significantly.  
I am now open to taking a medication but am afraid of ssri due to potentially permanent sexual side effects (PSSD) and potential long term dependance (i dont want to be on a medication super long term since this feels more like an accute issue). Would Buspar be something which could potentially help me? I just need something which will calm me down and take the edge off enough to begin pushing myself more and more through exposure/reintegration back into my 'old' life of school, work, hanging with friends, dating, etc."

So I started having nightmares that I was dying, it probably only lasted a few seconds but it felt like at least a minute. When I finally snapped out of it my my heart rate was going crazy so I went into the bathroom to catch my breathe and I was weak/shaky. I finally calmed down enough to go back to sleep. I checked my Fitbit and this all happened around 5AM, last 30 minutes with a peak heart rate of 110. Would this be considered a panic attack or does it sound like something else?"

For as long as I can remember I've had problems with anxiety, it's something I've gone to therapy for long enough for them to apparently give up on me or at least feel like I don't need any help(?).
I went through a couple ECT and later TMS during the therapy was forcefully held at the clinic for a year or so (can't remember because of the ECT). Somewhere along the line I started to get these heart palpitations(?) that came and went randomly. I talked to the doctors about it but they didn't really care much about it and just did an ECG, which didn't find anything abnormal.

These palpitations feels weird though, they are definitely not consistant and I have no way of predicting when or how often they occure which I guess msde it hard to treat. 
The only thing that I know for sure about them is that they can feel like 1-5 strong heartbeats, I always ""hear"" them in my ears and almost always makes it a bit harder for me to breathe while it beats. Some extra strong once have occure which made me lose focus and a bit of my sight but those are really rare. 
Oh and these are basically constant with an interval of a few seconds to minutes, random intensity throughout everyday.


I think that should cover everything important so with all that said.
Have anyone else felt something similar to this, is it something I need to worry about or do I just have to accept and deal with this for the rest of my life?"

190zliz,Anxiety,2024-01-07,Tightness in Diaphragm? SOB When Standing?,"Hello! Long time anxiety sufferer here!! Last night I had one of the worst nights I've had in a while, panic wise. 

For clarity sake, I have a really, really bad stomach. I swear something isn't right with my sympathetic nervous system like she is very overreactive. I also have GERD, and am on PPIs and cannot eat alot. I'm also on Prozac and Hydroxyzine. 

Well last night I must have waited too long to eat and my stomach got b l o a t e d. Which lead to SOB, which lead to a massive panic attack where I could literally NOT BREATHE if I was standing up. It felt like my stomach was so tight that it just couldn't extend, or I just couldn't breathe around something in there. I was hyperventilating and my vision was blurry amd I felt like if I didn't sit or lay down I would never catch my breath. 

I've had this before, unfortunately, and my SPO2 is always perfect, and I guess I'm just wondering if anyone else get a debilitating symptom like that? Eventually I had to force myself to stand and get my calm down pill, and the pressure did eventually go, but today it lingers a bit and I want to know that I'm not alone. 

My mother has actually been rushed to the hospital many times for the same exact feeling, and every single time they tell her it's her stomach, so I may have inherited that from her- but I am still very shaken up and curious if anyone else suffers from this, and if you do- how the FUCK do you manage it?"

And breathing exercises feel like they rarely work because that makes me focus even harder on my breathing and notice anything that I think is weird or feels weird. And it feels like nothing will feel ""normal"" at this rate. If I breathe too heavily, that's concerning. If I stop breathing heavily, I become aware of that too. If my heart is beating too fast, something is wrong. If I can't feel my heartbeat or my chest feels ""empty"" then that's just as concerning. Nothing makes me feel comfortable.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm in therapy now (I have an appointment today even) and am seeing a psychiatrist again, trying to tell myself that it's just my anxiety giving me these feelings and concerned and that there's nothing to actually panic about, but man it's tough and I'm getting sick of it."
190z0y7,Anxiety,2024-01-07,How do I deal with this?,"Okay so I am gonna be honest here. Me and some of my friends were caught using Marijuana during my college days by a professor. Though it was long back, that day still haunts me due to the fear and the professors involved the police into the matter to warn us. I kind of was not sure how I handled it. Though I did use it after, I was always afraid of getting caught again and would have auditory hallucinations. 

I'm generally introverted and was afraid of going into groups to talk and the fear of meeting new people always dawned upon me. I always lead a private life with minimal interactions with people. I think my anxiety levels shot up after the above incident. Because even after so many years, when I think back of it, I get so much irritated and afraid. I don't know if it's PTSD. Am I over-reacting? Should I worry so much for getting caught using something like that? 

I'm not a daily user. I only go for drinking or smoking like once a year or so now, but still if I do it, I get so afraid. 

Has someone felt similar things? How did you cope with it? I feel like anxiety and fear is dawning upon me and I won't be able to lead a proper life.

Any views would be highly appreciated "

I think my poor breathing habits (mouth breathing, rapid, shallow, chest)) is the cause of all my woes.  Its hard to change your breathing.  
I put a piece of tape by my mouth during the day (in the house) to remind me to keep it shut and a stick on heat pad on my abdomen to keep it warm so I don't tighten it up - makes it easier to remember to drag those breaths all the way down - past the chest.

It was a review of a product related to a game I play.  
Less than 5 minutes later someone commented essentially 'this is stupid and pointless so I won't watch it' and idk, I've just not been doing well in general, they down voted the post and my comments, and it shouldn't bother me but it did because I worked on it for a long time and they were rude AF without even bothering to watch it.   
I know it's dumb to be upset over that but it just hit me at a bad time and it was the only response I got to the video at all so I just deleted it and every other video on my youtube. And then I deleted my reddit account because I figured, everyone else also thinks this is a pointless video and theyre just nice enough not to say anything about it.  
It's a popular subreddit so I know lots of people see what's posted on there, but nobody came to my defense and that bothered me a lot because I have done nothing even remotely wrong and I got downvoted when I tried to defend myself. (On a side note, this particular sub prides itself in being accepting and welcoming but there is little or no pushback when someone decides not to be)

I have recently been struggling with agoraphobia in certain context. I am currently traveling through Europe with my partner and we spend a lot of time in nature. Every now and then when we go on hikes and that is when I sometimes get panick attacts. What triggers it are wide and high open spaces. I start to feel like the space overwhelms me and I cannot hold onto anything. I feel an intense urge to hide somewhere. I used to have episodes like that when I was younger in the mountains or in a spacious building like churches but they were very rare and didn't bother me that much. Now they happen quite regularly and I would deeply appreciate if you could share whether you ever struggled with anything like that and what helped you overcome it. Any book recomendations?

*I need to add that my anxiety disorder got much worse when 9 months ago I quit Cymbalta cold-turkey, which now I know was a big mistake. After that I struggled with intense agoraphobia a lot but it seemed to subside after a few months only to come back now. 

Thank you for your help and I send you a lot of light and love in the new year &lt;3"

I keep getting anxiety attacks but its like the symptoms keep changing every time I find a new solution to them. 

For example, when the anxiety first started I felt numb all over, almost like de realisation. Then I got obsessed with my heartbeat, and began hearing it all the time. Once I got over that, I started getting loads of visual snow. I still get that but not as much. Then I started feeling like I couldn‚Äôt breathe properly or my throat was swollen, but like way way intenser than usual . That happened last night and I‚Äôm still getting to grips that it was just anxiety. 

Basically, I get some anxiety symptom which I‚Äôll get stressed over for 1-3 days, and learn to deal with it. Then once I‚Äôve dealt with it, I just start experiencing some new symptom instead until I get over that.

I‚Äôm not sure why but even at home where I‚Äôm safe I always have anxiety sometimes, mostly when home alone. My parents understand my anxiety and are willing to help me get resources or help me get therapy if I need it (at the moment I‚Äôm not in it yet) so they are not the cause of it and same with my siblings they aren‚Äôt either. When my parents are home I feel okay, with my siblings I semi feel okay but if I‚Äôm the oldest in the house than I get a little sponge my younger siblings expect me to like be the bigger person. 

But when I‚Äôm home alone I always have a bad feeling like someone will be at my house just like ‚Äúlurking‚Äù and like trying to stalk me or whoever at my house. I mean no one in my family has a stalker and I sure don‚Äôt to me knowledge no one is/has but I always have that bad feeling. Or like someone would try to spy on me at my own house and the big one that probably won‚Äôt happen someone trying to break into my house. 

Now in my neighbourhood that stuff is like impossible no crimes or anything like that has been committed in my neighbourhood, but my anxiety always says like it‚Äôll happen and I get scared. As well if I‚Äôm home alone and the doorbell rings I get scared and don‚Äôt answer and wait until they leave. We have a doorbell camera so that can help if anything happens or we what to see who‚Äôs at the door, but sometimes I find myself checking it way too much when my anxiety is high. 

The only way this doesn‚Äôt happen is if I‚Äôm out of my house. I‚Äôm in school so sometimes I stay with my grandma since she lives closer to my campus. She lives in an apartment that is meant for older people (like older people who don‚Äôt need 24/7 care and can be independent) and so I have a key to get in and to her apartment she got from the superintendent there, it‚Äôs common for some children or grandchildren of the people have it just in case. But I almost feel safer there or anywhere else like my other grandparents house who I visit from time to time and it the same when I‚Äôm at my partners house and friends houses, but it‚Äôs always at my home.

190uyt2,Anxiety,2024-01-07,Does life with health anxiety ever get better?,"27F

It's been a year since I developed health anxiety that makes my life suck. Every day I manage to find a symptom to think about (probably many of them are anxiety-induced, so it's a vicious circle). 
Got meds prescriptions but it didn't make any drastic effect.
My mood gets worse after sunset and every evening I have at least one thought about feeling unwell, fear of death etc. 
Sometimes even something health/death related in books or movies makes me feel worse (and it wasn't like this before, I always was pretty okay with everything scary or gory).
My main concern now is that it will never get better. If I'm feeling like this at 27 being relatively healthy, how will my life be when I get older? At such a young age I get consumed by anxiety sometimes to a degree that I'm always scared and on high alert when not at home, always checking myself for feeling dizzy/shaky/weird, always thinking about what will happen if I start feeling unwell now and no one will help.
I see people my age just living their lives normally and I'm so afraid I will never get back to my not-anxious happy self and my life will just become worse and worse over time.
Did anyone else here feel like this for a long period of time and then managed to get better? I need happy stories and reassurance to feel better and to feel that I'm not alone in this..."

190p9tn,Anxiety,2024-01-07,Why do I keep having r!pe nightmares if I have never been assaulted?,"TW: rape and sexual assault 

I have a condition called chronic nightmares where I have a nightmare 50% of the time, an actual statistic from multiple months of tracking. 

However one of the more common and re-emerging themes I keep dreaming are of me being sexually assaulted or raped. 

It is never dreaming of the act itself, but rather the situation beforehand or me reacting afterwards. For example tonight I dreamed that the old man from my job was cornering me and it was just about me panicking about what to do, and then it fast forwarded to afterward of me being upset about what happened. 

There is absolutely no possibility of me having been raped as a child unless I was an extremely young child and it happened away from home. I have absolutely no history of sexual assault - not even a single instance. 

Is it likely that I‚Äôm just having these dreams due to anxiety? Due to the fact it‚Äôs a popular ‚Äúscary thing‚Äù? I think that would make sense considering how the assaulter is always an innocent man I know."

I was having this dizziness for more than a month and I was seen by 3 doctors saying that it's probably bppv.

She referred me to a specialist ENT and he mentioned that I've got a mild vertigo and by doing a maneuver, it will go away. Still in doubt though. He said that my nerve functionality is fine and there's no need for an MRI. After this maneuver, I don't feel as dizzy but now I've got stiff neck and I also get this burning sensation in my head.

190u154,Anxiety,2024-01-07,(TW: DEATH) does anyone else get hit with waves of anxiety about death that hasn't happened yet?,"To clarify, I'm not scared of dying. Rather, I'm abnormally at peace with the concept of mortality, to the degree that it freaks people out. I didn't exist for billions of years before I was born, and I assume it will be the same after I die. I consider life a pleasant holiday from nothingness, a chance the universe gives mindless matter to understand what it is for a while, before it returns to the void.

What I am scared of is loss. My grandparents are aging so much quicker as of late, my grandfather has a prognosis, my grandmother forgets things about her own life all the time. This fear is constant, but obviously gets worse when I'm with them.

Sometimes, though, I get waves of paranoia, usually in the dead of night. My cat is healthy and nine years old, but I am typing this post instead of going to bed, even though I'm exhausted, at 2:00am, because I am so utterly terrified that when I wake up he will not be alive anymore. I have no reason to be scared of this right now, but I'm fighting off a panic attack because I know that one day he will die and I cannot do that. I cannot live without him.

Does anyone else get this way sometimes? I really need to sleep, but I can't. I feel like if I go to sleep, my cat will die."

Now don‚Äôt get me wrong, I love all the good things my job does for me: financial independence, structure, discipline, exposure to real life and real world problems.

However, I am EXTREMELY anxious over everything that‚Äôs related to my work environment. I am scared of fucking up, scared of making mistakes and I feel like I just can‚Äôt seem to adapt to the situation. While the workplace might seem keen on keeping me as part of the workforce, I can‚Äôt help but live in anticipation of every single shred of slight criticism that I may face. 

I know that in all job places, there will always be something to work on, room for improvement, things to get better at. I know that for a fact. And I know that, well, sometimes, things may be rough but it‚Äôs all a learning process. Especially for someone who‚Äôs training to be part of the field: responsibilities and expectations are much more elevated. However, I can‚Äôt help but feel like I‚Äôm living in limbo.

To be brutally honest, there are numerous evenings or even mornings where I find myself crying before work begins. I literally live in the anticipation of remarks, of being told that I‚Äôve been working months at this job and I still can‚Äôt seem to do something good out of it, that I‚Äôm sometimes slowing down the work process because other more experienced team members have to teach me how to do things right, that I‚Äôve been delegated the smoothest tasks out of the basket and that I still seem to be struggling.

What can I do about all this? How can I reduce this level of anxiety while also developing sharper skills at work? How can I grow thick skin towards this? While people may say that quitting is an option, I‚Äôm 24, this is my third job, but admittedly the first one where I earn an actual salary, where I am confronted with far greater responsibilities and where I am promised a certain level of security. 

How can I work on myself?

P.S: Thank you for reading my post and helping me out. You are important and you are loved. All the best."
190thqm,Anxiety,2024-01-07,Anxiety nausea,Does anyone else get bad anxiety nausea? Every day before work or before I do anything that causes anxiety I immediately feel nauseous and I honestly wish my body would just puke instead of feeling sick for the fun of it. Atleast then it feels real and not just some weird part of me that makes situations even more unbearable.
190tet8,Anxiety,2024-01-07,Opipramol - my experience,"I just answered a couple of different, older questions about this drug which, whilst common in Europe is not at all common in the US it seems but sems to be becoming more widely prescribed. It is an older anti-depressant that was found to have better anxiolytic effects. Read more here: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opipramol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opipramol) 

Anyway, here's my experience as I have a seen a few questions/ posts seeking advice about it and I have extensive experience of its use, take what is useful, I hope it helps someone.

I was first prescribed Opipramol by my GP (PCP) 4 years ago and took 100-0-100, it definitely had a calming effect on my anxiety (GAD with panic episodes) pretty quickly. I had suffered with anxiety mildly since I was a late teen but in the previous 5 years it had been peaking. At the point of prescription, the anxiety was acute and becoming unbearable. The evening dose initially helped with sleep (definitely the falling asleep part, I still woke 1 - 2 times a night occasionally but previously I had an inability to fall asleep plus waking up 2-5 times pretty much every night). And I definitely had a reduction in anxiety, it was like that 'feeling' (you all know what I mean)  started to feel 'further away' from me ... like I was mildly aware of it but not bothered by it.  It seemed to mask it somehow, I hope that makes sense... But in summary I was happy with the effect. I stopped jumping at sudden noises, mildly stopped  catastrophizing - I was enamoured of the meds for sure after having the GAD for too long especially the catastrophizing.  
  
Long story short, due to a separate issue I stopped taking it (traumatic bereavement and intense grief, very badly handled).  I stopped because I started drinking ***a*** ***lot due*** to this and I learned that acute alcohol intoxication is contra-indicated (I found out the hard way) and so I stopped after a little less than a year. A year/year and half later I started again (same dose) after I had cut down the alcohol ***a lot.***.. then later stopped drinking completely . The effects are much better, I was taking it for anxiety mostly but the (light) anti-depressant effect kicked in this time after about 6/8 months (felt this more acutely after I quit the booze entirely) and I've now been taking it for almost 2 years this cycle with no side effects and no decrease in its (subjective) function. Again, the slow reduction of drinking then being teetotal may have skewed the results but I can say that for me 100-0-100 dose has both entirely eliminated the general anxiety and I catastrophize very rarely these days.  It has also made me generally happier overall. Stopping booze is also a game changer for anxiety and depression generally. 

I also just re-read the potential side effects through and can say that for me, I had none of the rare effects and the 'fairly common' one I had was a dry nose/mucus. I don't know for how long I will take it (or for how long it is advised, my German doctor who has been prescribing this to many patients for multiple years isn't concerned about very long term use) and I feel better that it has lower/virtually no anti-cholinergic effects, though I would rather it had zero. 

Living with anxiety isn't something I'd wish on my worst enemy so I like to help where I can, of course YMMV but sharing FWIW. "

190t7pr,Anxiety,2024-01-07,Zoloft and exhaustion + brain fog,"I‚Äôve been on 50mg for 5 months. Prior to starting Zoloft, I‚Äôd wake up at 5am to exercise in the morning. As soon as I started talking Zoloft that stopped because I feel absolutely exhausted each morning. I would go as far as to say that Zoloft makes me feel drugged when I first wake up. It doesn‚Äôt matter what time of day I take it at. I‚Äôve tried morning, afternoon and night. 

Is there anything I can do to get rid of the exhaustion and brain fog? I asked my doc to try Wellbutrin and she said no because she is worried the Wellbutrin will make my anxiety worse."
190t2pj,Anxiety,2024-01-07,Thank you for the support,"(Potential TW as could refer to self harm)

I have come back to this subreddit after some decent time. I don't exactly remember why I came here initially all I do know is that this group is why I started actually seeing a real doctor and got my diagnosis and pills post my mental health crisis and my breaking point above four or so years back. 

I do remember the sept of 2020 was particularly my darkest period for me to the point of me forcing myself away from tall ledges or sharp things like knifes and one night after meticulous planning the least painful to go out. I don't want to go into the details of it. I didn't go through because I knew my grandmother died because of COVID and the entire nightmare scenarios that was there in the initial wave. I had seen what it did to my mother and I couldn't let her have two tragedies in one horrible year. And so I waited and said if by next year I am not in a better spot I would reconsider and so I visited a therapist and got the courage to open up to a stranger.

I remember crying after getting a panic disorder, GAD and MDD disorder because I finally understood what was wrong . I wasn't cursed, I just have to train my brain again to not misfire.I can have a plan to try to sort it out. While easier said than done and the side effects were some of the most psychologically challenging things I had to face, time goes by and with medication, help and just learning to love and listen myself, my problems weren't as bad as I made them out to be. They were just lies I told myself. 

Since that fateful winter night of me looking outside the window ledge of my balcony, I remebet the ""promise"" I keep breaking in my state of crisis and while my problems were quite tough, I needed a perspective shift. I am still an anxious meat bag holding organs but I'm way better than being too overwhelmed to even breathe. I'm getting better and getting through my own demons of my own making. 

If it wasn't for that post I had seen in this subreddit so many years ago as well as one kind random person DM me to calm me down when I lost my mind, I could have potentially delayed my treatment even longer and increase the struggles I inflicted on myself for no real reason. 

So thank you"

190rwxi,Anxiety,2024-01-07,L-tryptophan and L-theanine together?,"you probably know what are these (calming) aminoacids can be used for...

Theoretically, combining them (taking a pill of theanine and tryptophan at the same time) should lead to a synergistic effect... (Actually, I don't know what the difference between these amino acids is in terms of the effect on the brain..)  
  
I've heard that there is some kind of interaction here: that is, one amino acid ""blocks"" the other and vice versa - and that ultimately the body only absorbs a small amount of each of the two amino acids.

190rt1v,Anxiety,2024-01-07,How do you manage anxiety first thing in the morning?,"Hi all, I'm relatively new to this sub but unfortunately not new to struggling with anxiety. Over the last couple weeks it feels like my anxiety is getting to be unmanageable. I believe the main source of my anxiety and stress has come from the holiday season, but I know that I have a problem with ruminating on my anxiety which in turn makes it worse. My anxiety and gut also have a very strong connection. 

This is all to say - some mornings I feel so physically sick from my anxiety that it ruins the whole course of the day for me. I will spend hours curled up in my room with a trash can on standby in case I do vomit - which has happened multiple times. I can't keep living my life like this, it gets especially worse when I know I have some form of upcoming event. I fear I'll never be able to work a day shift job with my anxiety and gut in the condition they are. When I get anxious like this I try to keep myself distracted in some way, usually watching videos or a show to try and keep my mind busy. I also try to practice mindful breathing and thinking, but these only work to an extent. Does anyone have any advice or tips on how to try to keep my anxiety sickness away? I am hoping to get medication for both my stomach and anxiety - but it's proving to be a longer and much more complicated process than I remember."

190rce6,Anxiety,2024-01-07,"I feel not present, or like I have a blurred vision and I think thats the cause","So Im 19M and I had really bad Anxiety back in 2020-21 (around that) I remember that for months I couldnt sleep, When I fell asleep I woke up at the exact moment my mind turned off I felt like my heart stopped and quickly woke up and sat up, I was stressing, I was sweating for months every night I actually tought I had a heart problem but then I heard of Anxiety symptoms and I realised I probably have that, at the time my parents divorced I was the one who made decisions, My mother asked me what should SHE do, but I loved both my mother and father so it was a really hard time for me to decide, after that we moved in the city, my father was treathening us with suicide and I was really worried, that went for a month or two aswell, meanwhile my school started, but before all of this I had covid, and I had weird symptoms, so my doctor said I had to do an Xray (I think thats what it is) case I might have cancer so he cannot give me the medications for covid if I have cancer, and I was so stressed for the results aswell (I did not have cancer) 

All in all I stressed a lot in the past years and I noticed that I feel not present a lot of the time when Im stressed even a bit, I am a gamer, or atleast I was, back then I was always the best player in the friend group, or I was the best in class I was a smart kid, but now if I sit down to play with friends I get anxious and I feel like my eyes literally cant focus on the monitor, my response time is not there, I feel like I cant perform like I did before in anything, sometimes I can, when Im not thinking about it too much but for 99% of the time even if I think about playing and not performing well makes me feel zoned out, like my mind wants to separate me from the thing that makes me stressed, and It ruins me, even if I go to my grandma with family to play card games together like we did for the past 6 years I get sleepy and my eyes get ‚Äûblurry‚Äù, I dont know what to do but this ruins any time I spend with my friends or with my family, I cant imagine how do I look like for them sometimes, like a zombie, cant speak properly, cant focus, cant think.
Nowadays I feel okay with my life I mean, I have problems but I feel like I would be okay, if this eye focus thing wouldnt come as soon as I get stressed over something, I have better days but that makes me have no personality

Previous to it, I was conscious of racing thoughts i couldn't stop.  When i woke up, they were kind of screaming in fear.  They got too much.  I wasn't scared but my focus was on my the palpitations. This calmed it.  

I'm sharing, as this is the first time I haven't been overwhelmed by fear but have a part of me which is observing whats happening.  

I've had some realisations recently regarding my anxiety / low self esteem.  Its like i have this observer in day to day life (i've done some metta meditation / mindfulness / massage which could've initiated it). 

I realise how much my anxiety / low self esteem - don't they co-exist? - have become the the main way i see, relate to myself, others and the world.  My identity. 

I think its combination of massage / meditation and commitment.  My plan is to start swimming and weekly massages for 3 months - there is scientific evidence they help.

I would really like it if you shared your experience of an 'observer' / have found relief through massage or exercise.

190qroy,Anxiety,2024-01-07,I‚Äôm never happy with what I‚Äôve got,"I‚Äôm always seeking for something else when it comes to life decisions. I lived in the central city where all my friends live and there‚Äôs a lot of nice restaurants and events. A year ago I wanted peace and quiet, wanted easy access to nature fron my home so I moved to the edge of the city near a national park. But now I never go there because I always have to go alone, now it feels like I would rather live in the city and maybe make a once in a while trip to the national park with a group of friends. It just feels like I have made my life very lonely since it takes me 1 hour to go see my friends and no one wants to come here for that reason. What‚Äôs wrong with me??

This was just an example but it has made me feel like I can‚Äôt trust myself because when I look at the previous decisions that I have done I can‚Äôt understand why and it feels like someone else made them.

I know this is not how it works and I should be getting out and/or trying to do things like hobbies and projects around the house. I dont work at the moment so I have all this down time at home. I live alone so I am always by myself and I just sit in the same chair dealing with my anxiety symptoms until it's time to go to bed. I do this because whenever I get up to do anything else or go anywhere, my anxiety flares up and I get spaced out and dissociate etc and it's hard and scary.   
My question is after a revelation this morning, shouldnt I push through the terrible feelings of anxiety and do things anyway? Even though I'ts scary and feels weird and my anxiety flares up really bad? Isnt this the way out? Being involved? Instead of waiting for new symptoms to analyze?  
I was worried at first that the Effexor was making it worse but I think it's just the way I am dealing with the anxiety. I cant just sit and wait to feel like my old self right? And ruminate on the fact that I feel bad/weird?"

190pmwu,Anxiety,2024-01-07,I keep replaying scenarios in my head where someone is breaking into my apartment,"It's currently almost 5am. My sleep schedule has been a bit messed up (for reasons unrelated to anxiety) and I'm up feeling incredibly antsy and anxious. 

I've been on Lexapro for just over a year now. That aging, and learning to avoid certain triggers has helped a lot with the random anxiety I get. I often freak out when I'm alone or when it's dark. I slept with a night light until probably 2.5 years ago. I'd cry myself to sleep out of fear as a kid (now 21) despite the night lights. Stuff like that has subsided for the most part, but it comes back occasionally like now. 

Typically, my boyfriend is around (currently online) and just texting him is enough to calm me but he's working at the moment. So for the first time in a while I just have to deal with this paranoia on my own. 

Sometimes the scenarios are completely made up, and other times they're things I've seen in TV shows or something that I now fear will happen to me someday. I feel like even just getting out of bed and making sure my doors are locked is enough to result in my murder. To me, my bedroom is safe if the door is locked. As long as I'm quiet, move as little as possible, and the door is locked, I'm mostly okay. 

Except I now realize someone could be under my bed or in my closet. I recognize it's unlikely. I haven't left my apartment in around a week. I would know if someone entered. But the thought is just there. What if they've been there for months? That sort of thing. I think the only thing keeping me from completely panicking is the Lexapro."
190pkfq,Anxiety,2024-01-07,Got Dumped Today Because of My Anxiety :),"I'd been with my GF for around 3 months now-- great the entire time. On Jan 1st, I had a huge anxiety/panic attack that I had to go the ER. I have a history of Health Anxiety, but I'd been anxiety-free for nearly 3 years. Anyway, being home for the holidays and especially being around certain family members + caffeine and nicotine really did me in. I had to go the ER because I don't have medication and I couldn't calm down.

So, I was texting her while I was there and I couldn't respond every second because A) I was freaking out, and B) The hospital staff kept telling me to do certain things. GF had been texting me to ask if I was alright, and I was like ""eh, not really. I had a huge anxiety attack but I won't stress you with the details."" She said that it wouldn't stress her out and that she wants to know what's going on with me, so I decided to go into detail about what I was feeling and what happened. Lo and behold she says she wasn't prepared for all that, but we eventually switched topics and everything was fine.

Now we both got back in the same town and she came to my apartment and broke up with me. Said that it really stressed her out and that she can't be around someone who has anxiety because of her own that she's been overcoming. Said I was great, blah blah blah, but for her own mental health she can't support someone like that.

TLDR; Had a huge anxiety attack, told GF, she said she can't be the support I need for her own mental health, and broke up with me.

I get it, it's tough to be support someone and it's semi-fair, but I still think it's kind of sh\*tty to just leave at the *first* sign of someone needing help. I also strongly believe that the core of a relationship is built on care and trust in the other person and leaning on each other when they need to. Clearly I dodged a bullet, but it still sucks."
190pc9s,Anxiety,2024-01-07,Am I developing GAD and panic disorder?,"Am I developing panic disorder and anxiety?

Two years ago I had a near fainting experience / blood pressure drop where I thought I was dying. In retrospect, I clearly overreacted to the symptoms I experienced and I guess this was my first panic attack but didn‚Äôt identify it as such at the time.

This never happened again until last week where I had a very similar experience which triggered this past trauma.

However this time I started freaking out and developed health anxiety during the days following the attack. I felt weak for days while my anxiety kept climbing. I felt something was strange with my body and how I felt. I started googling symptoms and read about heart attacks, dysautonomia etc. For the first time in my life I experienced sense of doom and cried in front of my partner saying I feel something is weird and I‚Äôm scared for the future.

Today I physically felt okay, went to the gym and decided to force myself to go restaurant to prove myself I could still do it. During the entire morning I could not stop thinking about my health and condition. I started feeling unwell in the mall and overall sad that I‚Äôm not the one I used to be. I felt hypersensitive an cold. Sat down in the restaurant, looked at the menu and felt I was not even able to eat. It was a strange feeling. I felt hopeless like my life is ruined if I cant even eat in a restaurant without experiencing symptoms. Felt overwhelmed and was about to run out of the restaurant but decided to endure it and forced myself to eat. After like 10 minutes it got better. I left the restaurant and felt much better after deciding I would be going home. Rest of the afternoon I felt normal. In a way I even felt relieved it happened (like nothing worse can happen) and felt calm afterwards.

This is terrifying as it‚Äôs overwhelming and cant be controlled. I feel my life will be destroyed by what I‚Äôm experiencing this past few days.

Past year I put significant amount of stress on my nervous system and feel I‚Äôm now getting the consequences of that.  In December I took cold showers everyday until I stoped few days before the first recent attack. I‚Äôm also currently trying to reduce my cheap dopamine consumption (po*n).

Could I be experiencing a dopamine crash? Could this be temporary? I‚Äôm scared to develop long term panic disorder and anxiety. Are GAD and panic disorder linked?"

I‚Äôve always struggled with anxiety around world events but it‚Äôs gotten so much worse over the past month. Between some recent escalation in multiple wars around the world I can‚Äôt help but feel a sense that something big is going to happen in the next few years. As much as I try to think rationally and tell myself that everything is okay I can‚Äôt fully get rid of this feeling. Researching the actual probability of something like a world war happening any time soon has helped calm my anxiety but I feel like it‚Äôs only a matter of time before it gets worse. I‚Äôve tried limiting my social media use to avoid fear mongering  but I can‚Äôt get rid of the overwhelming sense of dread. I guess I‚Äôm on here looking for reassurance that everything is going to be okay or at least ways to keep myself calm in the short term. Is there actually any reason to worry or am I thinking too much into things?"

Last Sunday I had to call out due to food poisoning, I was vomiting and couldn't work. I did so 3 hours before my shift.

Unfortunately this week I stubbed my toe and it broke, and I've been reading that putting too much strain on it (walking, which a lot of my job requires) can cause it to heal wrong. I have a noticable limp and my work shoes make it extremely painful to walk. I'm thinking of calling out today, but I'm worried that I may be fired.

I have 95% attendance and before last Sunday I hadn't called out in a month and a half, but I do have the occasional issue at work that I go home for (panic disorder, panic &amp; anxiety attacks). I'm worried my other managers may think I'm abusing the system.

I could go to work if I really pushed myself to, but I'm worried it might be bad for the toe. I run orders out frequently and it's a lot of strain. I need help, am I going to be fired?"

190n1y1,Anxiety,2024-01-07,Struggling with anxiety returning home from college.,"Hey guys, first reddit post. I have been struggling with severe panic attacks daily while I was home for college and would get them often right when I was in bed ready to fall asleep. Where I experience panic attacks where it feels like a heart attack as I get the tightening in the chest, hyperventilation, etc. The only thing that would calm me down was my mom playing with my hair and rubbing my arm and hand. My anxiety has increased recently horribly rapidly ever since I graduated high school. (May 2023) As during that Summer I was suffering from recent diagnosed POTS chronic illness and still am which triggers a lot of the anxiety I feel. After experiencing some of that wild medical journey I have been having a lot of medical anxiety. I also had gone through so many things over that Summer; an ER visit, losing friends, a bunch of shit that happened my second semester of high school suddenly hitting me, my parents moving away from my town to a new state, and me going to college out of state. I think it‚Äôs pretty valid for me to have a lot built up feelings and anxiety about what‚Äôs happened and sadly I basically had to leave my therapist due to her out of state rules and such. This is basically a big bulk of context but I started feeling better when I was busy due to my workload in college for my first quarter where I was hanging with new friends and enjoying new things until I had to return home for college in my parents new home. I then had way more flare ups with my chronic illness and way more panic attacks multiple times day. It affects me so much when I need to sleep and it makes me so exhausted miserable. Now I‚Äôm returning to college and I noticed that I‚Äôm just not feeling like the person I was. I feel so defeated and exhausted. My anxiety has been rough and it‚Äôs almost 2:00am due to my panic feelings I get all the time. I am terrified that I won‚Äôt be able to make through my second quarter of college. I have talked to my mom about it and she also witnesses it but I think I need to be more serious and think of a plan to get the help I need. (Apologies for typos)"

190mwod,Anxiety,2024-01-07,I (21FM) started smoking weed at 14. I am now 21 and terrified to smoke again‚Ä¶but I want to try.,"So around the age of 14 I started smoking I had and still have several anxiety and depression, so I figured weed could help me. It made me really calm and tired overall just relaxed me and let me enjoy life a bit more.  It definitely helped my anxiety ALOT. When I was 16, me and my boyfriend broke up and I moved away where I met up with my amazing friend and he smoked to so we always smoked together and eventually started dating. But Fast forward to 18 years old, I was even more depressed and I had tried to commit suicide and I was smoking every chance I got. I just needed something to numb me and that‚Äôs what I counted on. I had started smoking delta 8 carts religiously maybe 7 carts a month.  It was bad and if I didn‚Äôt have my carts I‚Äôd become violent and I had outbursts and got into a lot of fights. I was high almost 24/7. I‚Äôd get high before I went to bed. I‚Äôd wake up at 4 in the morning to get high again, then I‚Äôd fall back asleep and immediately smoke when I woke up and continued throughout the day.
At 19 I got pregnant and I was still smoking up to 7 week pregnant. I was told to stop for the safety of my child. So I did. 
After I had my son it was about 2 months later I tried smoking again and it made my heart race again I became very agitated and jittery. I was so confused on why because I went years and years smoking and being completely fine to having severe panic attack whenever I smoked now. 
I‚Äôm really confused on why I can‚Äôt smoke anymore, I really want to start again, but it gives me the worse anxiety on top of the anxiety I already have. I wanna smoke again cuz everyone I know smokes and a lot of people tell me to try it again or whatever. And I‚Äôm out of options for medications due to severe side effects of them. 

The last time I smoked was recent and I still had the same reaction unfortunately.  Idk what changed. 

Has anyone else experienced this at all before? Smoking for years constantly. To having panic attacks whenever you smoke in present time??? Please tell me I‚Äôm not alone here."

Because of that I miss out a lot with family and friends whenever anyone talks about a certain show or book.

The same happens with me on some adventurous stuff. People seem to love them but I cannot stand it. Travelling too gives me anxiety.

190ljpr,Anxiety,2024-01-07,I was in denial of my GAD diagnosis because of how normal it was for me to feel anxious,"For context i had a rough childhood and ended up very mentally ill by the end of high school. When i turned 18 i decided to seek treatment for my depression alone, so i was very confused as to why my psych diagnosed me with general anxiety disorder (GAD).

It actually frustrated me and i was fully convinced that it was a misdiagnosis. When i was referred to therapists i'd tell them the same thing, but it wasn't until years later in my early 20s that i properly got treated for anxiety. It also wasn't until now that i remembered my GAD diagnosis and realised i'd been suffering from crippling anxiety for years without me even knowing because being constantly on edge was just that normal for me.

I guess this is just the reality for kids who grow up in traumatic environments. We reach adulthood still in that loop of constant fear but we literally don't know any different, ending up unknowingly navigating the world through a very twisted lens until we stop functioning and reach our breaking points as adults.

Here i am at 23 and it took me that long to really start treating my anxiety properly and understanding just how crushing and detrimental it has been in all aspects of my life. Now i can heal."

my panic attacks are everyday, if not every other day.. thursday i had one on and off for 16 hours. i went to the er 7 times in early december to get it treated because they didn't trust me with the ativan at home. i'm constantly in this mode and its started to affect me physically. i'm always nauseous, having migraines, i'm experiencing bad derealization, i just feel super ludic, my eyesight is always foggy and strained, i've been hiding out in my bedroom since early dec now, i'm throwing up from time to time, some days i can't even eat or drink liquids, i'm always tired, i sleep for hours and still feel the need to sleep, i have bad hot flashes and chills, my hands and feet go numb a lot, and my thoughts just keep getting worse. my panic attacks started out of nowhere and they always happen with no reason, which is what scares me the most.

my doctor has been working on getting me to a therapist, but we have to fight to even try to get them to try and take me. they tell me constantly i have no referrals, even though my doctor said she made a referral. 

lately it's gotten so bad to the point where i have somehow convinced myself i'm slowly dying (i know we're all technically slowly dying on the daily, but i mean that i'm convinced i only have a few weeks to only months left) or i'm possessed (again, another silly thought.. i know, but i can't help it in this state). all i can say is i'm sick of this and i don't know what else to do. i want to be able to get out of bed and not feel like the world isn't real/feeling like my life is real, i want to be able to see my surroundings clearly again, and i don't want to feel so hopeless. i just need reassurance it feels like. :/"
190l4xt,Anxiety,2024-01-07,This didn‚Äôt work for me,"When it comes to health anxiety, people  say ‚Äúthis didn‚Äôt work for me, or ‚Ä¶,maybe that worked for you, but not for me. That method is outdated.‚Äù

 What didn‚Äôt work?  What method? What are we talking about? If you firmly believed standing on your head worked, it would work. Yes, you are going to find your own way, but this all basically boils down to changing how you view this and not fighting it. A nurse once confessed to me that she lied to patients who came to the ER with panic attacks and told them  that they had put meds in their IV that would quickly regulate their heartbeat. Not legal. They believed it and it worked.  I have yet to find anyone who actually overcame this condition who disagrees with the basic principle that this is more about not worrying and ruminating about it and not seeing it as a threat. And yes you will still get symptoms for a while with or without anxiety . AND NO IT‚ÄôS NOT EASY AND I DON‚ÄôT MINIMIZE IT. I don‚Äôt sugar coat it either. Sometimes it gets to you and there‚Äôs not a damn thing you can do about it, but you chip away by celebrating your minor victories. You dust yourself off and put it behind you to the best of your abilities and move on . You‚Äôre not doing anything wrong if you still get symptoms despite doing everything right.  Don‚Äôt let that add to your anxiety. Be patient,keep positive. Be kind to yourself . 

The people I have known who overcame health anxiety don‚Äôt talk about what meds to take (for me, if you need them to get by, so be it)‚Äî-they don‚Äôt talk about warm baths, avoiding coffee, going for a walk, vagus nerve, resolving old conflicts and forgiving those who hurt us‚Äî-I‚Äôm not knocking these, they help!‚Äî- but the focus of people who overcame this‚Äî-except for differences in minor points among them ‚Äî‚Äîis always more about how they changed their perspective. A few online gurus are too cold turkey for me. No crutches to feel better as far as they‚Äôre concerned. You need crutches or training wheels, bandaids at first.  I discovered quite a few of them. It‚Äôs just not humane or realistic to me not to use things to distract or calm yourself down. I had to learn how to trick my mind. 

Only those who haven‚Äôt had health anxiety or haven‚Äôt recovered from say otherwise about this being about beliefs and perspective. Of course these people know better. What do I know. And yes there are exceptions. I‚Äôve talked to a couple of women with serious emotional trauma where that was more of a factor. Always consult with a professional. I have a close friend who I only recently found out has schizophrenia. Except in some cases where there is a serious medical, psychiatric trauma involved, health anxiety in 97% of cases is usually caused by what you perceive‚Äî-your beliefs and self talk‚Ä¶ a trigger. Over time this suggestion of danger becomes  an automatic response for your body , a false alarm. It‚Äôs up to you to gradually give it less importance and validity. You are going to find your own way, your own self talk to change your beliefs and perspective and your body will respond well. This isn‚Äôt so
much about doing anything as it is about leaving this alone, as difficult as this is. People feel they need to do something or that they are not doing something right. This is about getting out of the way and letting your body wind itself down. It‚Äôs a self regulating system. The more you try to control it, the more you agitate it. You are way more powerful than you realize.., if you learn to let go . After you kick this you will be better at dealing with adversity  than you ever were before."

Recently he has started talking about me to my mom. Just the usual stuff like whether I am eating or sleeping. Like nothing happened. This cycle of trama has repeated multiple times and it was my mistake to think that I can break it. I am done. I cannot fix him. It's not my responsibility. I moved back home with one goal and I need to do that. But sometimes these bouts of anxiety hurts. The pain, the trauma. It physically hurts. How do you live with man who is so traumatic. How does my mother do it everyday? She doesn't deserve this. I don't deserve this. But still here we are. Why is it that it is the people who has to deal with it has to do something about it? It's me who has to figure out a way out of this shit hole not him and clearly he is responsible for what I am going through. But I have to make myself okay. Take therapy, ignore, and whatever not him. That fucker is living his life. His patriarchal disgusting life. I hope he regrets. I want him to suffer. He should know that people don't love him.

My blood pressure is already pretty normal, it ranges from 114/84 to 119/85 with my heart being around 75. I started off with 5mg, felt nothing, so I took 10mg for the past 2 days while at work. I currently work in retail and my anxiety will just make my face go beet red for no reason - although with the 10mg I did feel a lot calmer and didn‚Äôt feel as jittery as I always do! I thought it was actually working, but then pretty much as soon as it hit the 4-5 hour mark after taking it, I think it wore off and I noticed my physical symptoms coming back. 

Looking back on it I honestly can‚Äôt even tell if it even worked in the first place or if it was the placebo effect. My questions are

1. Does 10mg really even do much in your experiences? 
2. When I first took 10mg, my blood pressure went from the usual 114/85 to 109/78. Would upping the dosage to 20mg make it drop way too much? I didn‚Äôt feel lightheaded at all so that‚Äôs a plus‚Ä¶ 
3. Would taking a higher dosage make it last longer?
4. For those of you who take it, since the effects usually wear off after 4-5 hours, do you take another pill then? Or would something like extended release be better? 

I realize the best way to figure this out is to actually take the 20mg and just see what happens, but this is just me obsessing and stressing over it before I actually take that step lol."
190k9iq,Anxiety,2024-01-07,Risk of premature beats on Smart Watch,"I actually had an ECG already prior to this, doc said everything is fine. I have health anxiety so chest pain is not new to me but this is causing me so much stress, makes me want to throw my watch.

Does anyone here getting some heartbeat problems on smart watch I have Huawei watch and it has about 90% accuracy tracking my heart rate so this is causing me stress and anxiety and I wanna get checked out again as I am freaking out watching this alerts yesterday. I just did an afternoon easy 3k run then at night I feel like having mild anxiety attack(I do experience anxiety attack occasionally) that caused bit of shortness of breath and me panicking I did a heart monitor on my watch and this came out.

Arrhythmia detected, Risk of Premature beats - I got this alert 3x in 2 hour monitoring.

Says it‚Äôs common for stressed or exhausted person but it just alarms me. Is ECG enough in hospitals to check if you have heart issue? Any recommendations too? I would appreciate it. Thank you"
190k9cx,Anxiety,2024-01-07,Obsessive anxiety about limb placement and fear of pain,"Hi everyone,I've been lurking  on reddit a long time but I've never made a post. I'm 27,I've had ocd for a very long time,well over a decade. While I've always been able to engage with therapy and deal with it fairly well in recent years,in the last 6 months or so ive had a ramping up ocd theme that feels like it's getting worst.

Around 6 months ago I pulled a muscle closing an open door; fair enough,done that a dozen time at the gym over the years but for some reason this began to lead to a very odd obsession over my limb position,mostly my arms, over fear of injuring them. It's literally all I can think about now,I'm incredibly overobserving of where my arms are,how I pick things up,grab things etc as a result I've hurt my back and shoulders numerous times, and almost in constant pain.it feels like I've been permanently injured for months,although a ultrasound of my shoulders doesn't show any concerning damage. 

It feels like I've literally forgotten somehow wheres a natural position to put my arms (like sitting down on the sofa,lying in bed etc) it's infuriating and really upsetting,since it's been too painful to actually exercise since it started. I've been unable to find any similar stories or literature, and I don't seem to be able to put into effect my usual techniques to dealing with ocd with whatever this is. 

I'm scared of causing chronic pain issues and never dealing with it; I can't even use my medical weed anymore since it seems to get worst doing that now. I'm really at my witts end,have I really forgotten how to move properly? Any advice or thoughts welcome,thank you!"
190k403,Anxiety,2024-01-07,Car anxiety,"How the hell do I even get over this. I had a panic attack in the car few months ago and ever since I haven‚Äôt driven alone.

I have no issue driving if I have someone else in the car with me, because of that blanket of knowing someone else could take over if I got trapped and nowhere to go spiraling.

I have had heart worries on and off sporadically through the years. But the last 2 years have been horrendous.

I was tested in June 2022. I had an ecg, zio patch for 14 days and an echocardiogram other than my usual PVCs and a slight heart murmur the cardio gave me a clean bill of health.

But‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ since then I have been stuck in a severe anxiety phase of thinking I am going to have a heart attack and die.

I am having panic attacks every week and they hit 170.

I am constantly checking my pulse I have an Apple Watch and a pulse ox. I check my bp daily it can range from 110/60 to 154/74. 

I am constantly holding my breathe and tensing which has caused so many stomach issues but I think it also contributes to my chest pain. I get so anxious when anyone visits or if I have to go out.

1908inw,Anxiety,2024-01-06,I have PTSD but never tell anyone as it seems silly why I have it,"When ever I hear PTSD I think of a veteran or a sexual assault survivor, really anything other then what happened to me. I inadvertently got a dog killed.

Contexts: 
1. I am a huge animal lover, I take care of a feral colony of cats that have all been fixed, and I really want to go in the rescue field at some point even if it‚Äôs just volunteering an hour a week. But I don‚Äôt think I can know because of this (I feel like I‚Äôm stalling)

2. I went to a really small town, there were only about 45 kids in my grade, I knew about 2/3 of them from all the way from kindergarten. It was also extremely racist and close minded town which was hard enough cause I‚Äôm lesbian, I heard the n word at least once a week, but that‚Äôs a different can of worms.

3. I was working two jobs both small hours one of them was at a pumpkin patch. I would pick pumpkins and help with customers. The other job was a cashier at a local pharmacy.

4. I already have anxiety, depression and panic attacks happen about once a month. At the time I was doing okay, i laid in bed most of my free time and was taking medication, I also pick up my skin and have trichophagia(I pull and eat my own hair) 

5. I was 17 when this happened 

On this day I was supposed to be picking pumpkins at a patch I have only went to once and it was my first time going there alone, I missed my turn. I told myself I was just going to turn around in the next driveway or road. The first of the two was a driveway of someone I sort of knew because of school, I was just starting my senior year at the time of this. So I pulled in and there two dogs ran up to me and started barking at the sides of my car. I waited probably just 2 or 3 seconds before I started pulling back out, they were both in front of my car at this point. I get out to the end of the driveway and see I can go, I pull all they way out, the dogs were going back to the house but still alert. With me in the road I see another car coming, I didn‚Äôt see it because I was backing up. I looked to my side to see the two dogs starring at me because I had to change gears. One of them didn‚Äôt like that and started running at my car (there driveway is about 50 feet long) I didn‚Äôt know what to do so I started honking to try and warn the other car but as the dog ran in the road the car passed. 

I jumped out of my car and saw the dog crawling back towards the house with half of her body limp. I ran as fast as I could up to the house and started knocking on the door and shouting. Eventually after like 15 or 20 seconds someone from behind a barn came out and said hello, same time the door opened and I just said your dog got hit by a car. Me and the two men ran out to the driveway where the poor dog was crawling, one of them picked her up and brought her into the backyard. Me and the other lady who was In the car that hit the dog just stood there wait for them to come back, but me and her talked a little bit. She said she didn‚Äôt see her and I said I was sorry as I felt it was my fault. 

They came out and said we could go so we both left. I went to work but left early because of what happened. I went home and told my mom everything and she said it wasn‚Äôt my fault but I‚Äôm the type of people to constantly say sorry and apologize for the littlest of things even if it wasn‚Äôt my fault so I felt guilty. I started constantly checking the family members Facebooks as I wanted to know if there was an update on the dog. On Sunday I was supposed to go volunteer for NHS and my mom woke me up and told me please don‚Äôt look at Facebook, I did. And they said that they had to put her down but from the interaction that we had they thought that I was the one that hit her. 

They thought I pulled and ran her over and pulled her out to the road. They said the next person the pulls in their driveway will get a rock through the window. I understand how they could misconstrued what I said, as they weren‚Äôt quite listening because they were mostly caring about their dog, but they knew it was me they could‚Äôve contacted me. My mom did reach out to her though, and tried to explain the situation as I was a wreck. I didn‚Äôt listen, but I knew that they got into an argument. My mom is just asking her to take down the Facebook post and then she explained what happened. The lady on the phone though was adamant about what happened and my mom asked if she was there because I was. She eventually realized that maybe she should‚Äôve posted and deleted it later in the week.

It was very hard for me after that as I still volunteered and told one of my friends that I was working with what happened but when Monday came around, I almost didn‚Äôt go to school. They never said my name in the Facebook post but their sons go to my school they‚Äôre only a grade below me and most classes have a mix of grades. I went anyway, and I was extremely anxious. I told my close friends what happened to and they were supporting me as they know the type of person that I am and that I would be much worse shape if I did hit the dog. 

I didn‚Äôt know this at the time, but on the first day, one of the brothers was telling some of my acquaintances what happened and the friend that I told on Saturday stood up for me and said that isn‚Äôt what happened. And asking those acquaintances later they also said that the story that he was describing doesn‚Äôt sound like me.

On Monday, though, I only was able to last half the day before I had a panic attack. It started getting so bad that I started hearing things walking to the cafeteria. They weren‚Äôt real, though it was my brain just running amok. The rest of the week was like that with me barely getting through days and having panic attacks constantly I was scared I was gonna lose everyone around me for some thing that I didn‚Äôt do. And because people were talking about me I started having a hard time trusting people. 

I know these all sound like extreme reactions. Like I said earlier, I‚Äôm not mentally sound, and this only made it worse. I‚Äôm a very honest person even when I‚Äôm in the wrong. And I have a hard time judging social interactions or cues. 

As the days went on, I would only ever be able to make about four of the five days of school for the rest of the school year. I couldn‚Äôt stand to be in the cafeteria anymore so I ate lunch at one of the teachers rooms. I became extremely depressed and ended up gaining a 100 pounds. My friends were still there for me though and so is everyone else because they knew the type of person I am. The woman who made the original Facebook post deleted it and then posting an update on what really happened but the post made it clear that she still didn‚Äôt believe me and saw it all as my fault.

One day at the pharmacy I was working the drive-through and the lady ended up pulling up. I just handed the phone to one of my coworkers and said you need to take this and I hid in the back room until she was gone. Luckily it was close to close so by the time I started to freak out, I was already in my car. 

Any time I saw her or her family I would just freeze up and try to get away as I knew I wouldn‚Äôt be able to control myself and would have a panic attack. It happened a couple more times I saw them out and about but by the end of the year. I was the heaviest and most depressed I‚Äôve ever been. a lot of people didn‚Äôt believe the story that they were saying, and mostly believed me. It helped, but the damage is already been done to my mental state. however, I started to come to the conclusion that it wasn‚Äôt my fault. It especially wasn‚Äôt the dogs fault (it‚Äôs a dog), it wasn‚Äôt even the owners fault, it just happened. 

I graduated and started a weight loss medication that I was also diagnosed with an eating disorder. One day I hung out with one of my friends, and we went to a store that buys from Amazon warehouses and then resells them at low prices, and I found some thing really good so I bought it and I had too much of it so I thought I would try to sell it on Facebook marketplace. Because of this I had to download messenger which I‚Äôve never had before and that‚Äôs when I saw that she messaged me about two or three weeks after the incident.

At this point, I was angry at her, I wanted to tell her how much she hurt me, ask her why she never believed me from the start, why would she make that post, why would you let your sons tell everyone that I purposefully kill your dog. I started trying to explain through messenger but I had a panic attack. I just got out of the shower and was only wearing underwear but I ended up crying so loud my mom heard and came up and comforted me for about 30 minutes until we were able to get a shirt on me, she said for me to not respond and to talk to my therapist first so I did and she said it was a great thing that I didn‚Äôt respond. I then got diagnosed with PTSD.

I still haven‚Äôt responded and I don‚Äôt think I ever will. I got out of the town in about a year ago, I‚Äôm 19 now and I live in Ann Arbor with one of my high school friends. as a matter fact, my whole group still is very close and they come down whenever they can and we hang out with each other. I still have a hard time trusting if they believe what I say, or if they even like being around me, but they still are here so I have my answer for that. 

I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll ever fully heal from this. Even though it would be something minor to someone else, I‚Äôm not mentally strong I need reassurance. 

Also, if you read this far, thank you this post took me a couple months to write as I would become mentally distressed when thinking about it, but the situation upsets me and I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll ever get over it as even here I panic about certain things. Like how dogs make me uncomfortable I can‚Äôt turn around in peoples driveways or death of a pet it‚Äôs hard for me to talk about. And considering how I wanted to work with animals and in the rescue field I feel like I can‚Äôt do it anymore as I‚Äôm scared that people think I purposefully killed an animal when I was trying to help it. I feels like she took that from me but I‚Äôm still gonna try even if it‚Äôs hard and my brain panics I still want to help animals. 

Again, thank you and if you don‚Äôt read all of us that‚Äôs totally fine. I understand this is a shit ton I just needed to tell anyone and vent"
190j0ps,Anxiety,2024-01-07,severe panic disorder + heart scare + agoraphobia + losing everyone I loved = hell,"Hey there. 39/M. Thanks for reading. Been fighting panic disorder and depression for 14 years. Have a therapist and psych, in the process of coming off Lexapro for Remeron. 

3 months ago went to ER for a possible arrythmia. Never been more scared in my life, was stuck underground the nyc subway my heart was skipping beats and wouldnt stop. Like a fish in my chest the rhythm was chaotic. 15 min for EMTs. As someone who has phobia around his heart and is terrified of skipped beats, this is my worst nightmare. I was hyperventilating, shaking, and terrified. I called my gf to say goodbye. After staying overnight, the only thing abnormal was troponin levels, were 57 ng/ml.  Stayed all night till they leveled off. 

They said it was from extreme panic/stress, my cardiologist agrees but slight possibility I did indeed have an arrythmia like afib or SVT, or just a few ectopic beats, and it set me off. Still ongoing testing but shes confident I'm ok and it's not fatal. EKGs, echos, holter, all ok. 

Im not confident at all. My anxiety has tripled. Ive always had heartphobia, but this broke me. I've developed agoraphobia now, and walking more than a couple blocks away from my house sets me off. I panic almost daily now. 

I should also mention since then I lost my job, my girlfriend and I broke up, my mother betrayed me, and my best friend bailed on me. I'm gonna be 40 soon, and feel like there's a midlife crisis on top of this. 

I'm getting help but have never felt more helpless. I'm doing the right things but never felt so wrong. I've never been so lost, alone, delirious, and horrified."
190j8zi,Anxiety,2024-01-07,Car anxiety as a parent,"I have insane anxiety involving cars that is becoming increasingly difficult to deal with as a mom that does not drive. 

I never learned to drive. My cousin died in a car accident when I was 16 - around the time I would be learning. My family delayed it and delayed it. Eventually I moved to a city. I still haven‚Äôt learned. 

At 18 I was in a yellow cab that was t boned by another cab. Thankfully I wasn‚Äôt seriously injured. I needed about 15 stitches but it was okay. 

Since then I have had bad anxiety whenever I am in a car. Constantly having my eyes on the road, worried about if something will happen etc. 

Fast forward to now I‚Äôm a toddler mom. My son and nanny were struck by a vehicle last year while they were walking in NYC. Thankfully both okay. 

A year later and he was just involved in another accident. A car missed a stop sign and struck our family car. Both cars badly damaged. The car struck exactly where my son was sitting. THANK GOD, everyone is okay. I know that is all that matters. 

But I‚Äôm still crying every night holding my child just worried of anything happening again. 

Something as simple as taking him to a class 5 minutes from our house is terrifying to me. 

Is this normal? I‚Äôm over thinking the whole thing. Like is it a sign? Do I need to change something about my life? 

Do I need to learn to drive?!!!!üòÖüò≠ü•≤

Maybe being in control would calm the anxiety?

I‚Äôm doing my masters and I‚Äôm 2.5 years in, this is my last semester. I passed all of my requirements and finished everything, however last semester I took a class outside of our department and ended up failing. I felt so hopeless. I know I didn‚Äôt study as hard as I did for all of my other classes, but the instructor wasn‚Äôt helping either. He told me I don‚Äôt deserve success or a masters degree, and that I was lowering the bar for other students just my being in the class.

I worked so hard to get to where I am and not go crazy in the process, his words really shook me. 

Luckily, my school recently instilled a new regulation whereby anyone who gets an F can repeat the class once and the old grade would be replaced.

This is the only class I‚Äôm taking and I‚Äôm 95% done with my thesis. I still have a lot of control over what happens, but I‚Äôm terrified. 

I can‚Äôt sleep, eat, or get out of bed and I feel unworthy. The semester‚Äôs a month away, I can‚Äôt imagine feeling like this for an entire month, possibly the entire semester. I‚Äôve already lost so much weight and hair, I‚Äôm worried this is going to affect my academic progress, but every time I try to fight to get up, I feel nauseous and weak.

190igd9,Anxiety,2024-01-07,Friends calling me paranoid,"Hey everyone, just wanted to get some advice or start a discussion.

I have struggled with Anxiety disorder/panic disorder and agoraphobia for a while now and recently off topic to the conversation, one of my friends specifically said that I was paranoid (not in a mean or accusatory way but in a matter of fact kind of way). I know they weren't trying to be mean or reductive but it has been really bothering me.

That friend thought I was diagnosed with Paranoid personality disorder and when I googled the symptoms, it just really didn't resonate with my experience and a big difference it had from the disorders I actually am struggling with was that symptoms were rooted in delusion and had no basis in reality. I think something I am working on is a lack of affirmation of my fears and anxieties, both from myself and others when I share how I am feeling.

That is why hearing from that friend that they thought in some part, that my shared anxieties were based in delusion and lacked reality was really hard for me to hear, especially because I thought they were someone who could listen to me without judgement.

Does anyone else have any advice about navigating feeling like your anxieties are not being affirmed? I do think I am a logical person and that my anxieties I deal with are based in reality... albeit not warranting the degree to which they affect my life.

I get anxiety for a lot of things like going out and things outside of my comfort zone but mostly my health. Every single pain, twitch, spasm I spiral so hard it literally takes over me for hours, days and lately weeks. I stay on google and Reddit for hours googling all my symptoms and it just makes me spiral even more (I know I need to stop), it makes me feel like I‚Äôm not myself, like I‚Äôm scared, hopeless and helpless. Sometimes I can‚Äôt eat or sleep or do anything but stay in bed trying to distract myself. Sometimes I wake up in the middle of the night with palpitations or wake up with anxiety. Sometimes I can‚Äôt even talk. It makes me physically ill, I start feeling weird pains, I can feel my heartbeat everywhere my stomach always hurts sometimes I think I‚Äôm gonna throw up. I‚Äôve tried different coping mechanism like teas, sucking on a lemon, cold water, praying to God, therapy, you name it. I never wanted to get on medications for side effects and because I wanna try and feel normal without being dependent on medications. But idk sometimes I feel like maybe I should. I just wanna feel normal and stop having anxiety everyday. Thank you for reading this and I appreciate all of your advice!"

basically I wanna make this shirt as possible 
7 months ago I injured back deadlifting , it was never properly diagnosed as anything but it caused sciatic pain. 
Went to the ER and started PT and it helped and I didn‚Äôt have that pain anymore but I did suffer from DPDR because of the panic I had from not taking medication 

I also have recovered from that too. 

Since pain from back had went away and leg pain I went back to the gym 
Day one was amazing 
Day two was also good 
Day was on the stair master and was walking and leg flaired up again and back and day after started getting weird tingling in the back of the head 

That progressed into weird and string tingling in the back of the head . I was getting super worried and it cause sharp headaches. It‚Äôs in the occipital area FORSURE I‚Äôve done all the research and it was also down my shoulders and neck and even arms some times. I have to once again say that it‚Äôs not like pain it‚Äôs also not tingly how you would feel like pins and needles it‚Äôs just there idk . And it went away after a while but now it has flared up I guess and I‚Äôm tired of worrying . I don‚Äôt know what it could be. Pt said it‚Äôs cervical radiculopsthy but that‚Äôs in the neck.

I feel like I'm turning crazy or losing my mind it's insane. One minute I'm fine and I can act and think rationally and the next I feel like I'm gonna drop from fatigue and like I can't think or function anymore AT ALL. Let alone talk. It feels like I have something in my brain turning it off it's so scary, I don't understand. I never knew anxiety could have this effect I thought I was having a brain tumor or something and went to the ER. The memories mesh together and I'm so confused. 

I'm absolutely terrified of death and the nothingness, absolutely convinced I'll die if I fall asleep and that I won't wake up, absolutely sure I have schozlphrenia, or cancer, or a stroke or something else it's driving me crazy I don't know what to do. Pretty sure I have some kind of health anxiety and I feel like this impending doom, like I'm certain I won't live old and I'm gonna die soon. I'm absolutely terrified all the time about my health and I've never had something like that before. 

I've been having actual symptoms of things that I obviously don't have since I've done the tests and they all come back clean, and I feel so ashamed of wasting people's time in the hospital.

Im curious - is there someone who developed claustrophobia (possibly in selective settings) out of their GAD or social anxiety, that they never had before?
What i started experiencing recently, after 2 years with social anxiety, is that i start getting panic attacks while (originally) on a crowded bus, plane, or specifically when the subway train stops inside the tunnel, and (now) with regular bus and subway rides. I feel like it stems from the idea of me not having an opportunity to leave the situation that triggers anxiety whenever I want (aka loss of control), so was curious if someone came up with a solution. 
P.S. whats interesting, is that this anxiety with situations that I cant physically leave developed only 2 years later.

Cheers!"

I know anxiety has triggers, but how often is it that the triggers need to be eliminated rather than be managed better? 

I ask this question bc of my situation with college. I had a rough semester with my anxiety. However I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs because I was mentally and physically burnt out, or if being at my particular college is the problem.

I feel overwhelmed by any single prospect of having to put effort into something I don't want to do. I've been laying in bed on my phone all day. I haven't eaten anything all day because the thought of making food sounds like such a chore I would rather lay here and starve. But I still feel anxious and overwhelmed by just laying here because I known I'm wasting my whole day. I've just been flipping through apps every minute and googling random things to avoid something, I don't even know what I'm trying to avoid. I'm super frustrated. It's 7PM and I finally found the courage to pick up my journal, but I'm just writing in circles trying to figure out what I'm actually thinking or feeling. 

I know the solution is to just bite the bullet and make something to eat for now, but after that what do I do? I have nothing I want to do and thinking of putting effort into something I don't want to do makes me want to stay in bed for longer. And I'm trying to figure out how to fix this issue because I do this all the time and it's ruining my life, but any type of thinking or introspecting that takes actual effort feels like too much for me. I don't understand myself or my feelings, my mind is so fucking foggy all the time. I need somebody to come punch me in the face. But then I would continue to lay in bed and loathe myself for being too shitty to get up even after being punched in the face. 

It's so frustrating when I see my therapist because I can't even convey this to him. I tried telling him that I feel stuck and want to improve myself and don't know how and I hate myself for it and all he kept repeating was ""you will only change when the pain of being the same outweighs the pain of changing."" I don't know what to do with that, I feel guilty that I'm not improving myself at all and I'm constantly so stuck and it feels like he's expressing his frustration that I can't learn or apply a damn thing. And I basically am just waiting for the pain of hunger to force me out of bed but that's not a very efficient way of living life.

I‚Äôve been having weird pains in the middle/left side of my chest for like a week out of nowhere. Honestly, it‚Äôs not even really pain, just discomfort and occasionally it feels tingly. For a few days it was definitely acid reflux because I had really bad heartburn due to the stress, but I think that‚Äôs gone away now. I couldn‚Äôt help but think I was having a heart attack, and currently, I‚Äôm afraid of that again because I feel so tense and anxious. I don‚Äôt even know why.

I‚Äôve been in therapy many times but I‚Äôm not currently seeing my therapist for financial reasons. I‚Äôve never been on any medication, but would it help me? Do I need to go back and see my therapist in order to see a psychiatrist? I don‚Äôt know. I just really need some help."
190goij,Anxiety,2024-01-07,How I got rid of my Anxiety Disorder,"I make it fast and simple.

I was afraid of everything since I was a child.
I was shy and had social anxiety.
As an adult, I was afraid to go outside, I was constantly nervous and anxious while walking outside. I had trouble sleeping and eating because I was always stressed and anxious.

What was the cause?

The main cause was simply the fear of other humans.

I was afraid of some sort of confrontation that could happen.

I was afraid of being attacked physically.
I was afraid of being attacked verbally.
I was afraid of being judged negatively
I was afraid of being criticised.
I was afraid that someone would make fun of me.

I was afraid because If someone did it, I couldn't defend myself.

I was weak.

And because of my weakness, people took advantage of it and actually treated me like shit.
I was constantly disrespected and humilated since my childhood.

When someone disrespected me, I couldn't defend myself, because I was a coward.

I was afraid of conflict and I was afraid of aggression and violence.

I was afraid of losing control and become
emotional.

I was a people pleaser and a pathetic coward.

I repressed everything. The repression and cowardice led to severe self esteem issues and an even stronger anxiety disorder. It was so severe I didn't even realized what the cause was, because I was 24/7 in a bad mood, anxious and stressed.

I just wanted to die.

It was so much pain that it actually forced me to finally defend myself.

What did I do?

I confronted the people who disrespected me.

I punched a coworker in the face.
I yelled at a coworker.
I talked calmy with a coworker.
I talked aggressively with a coworker.
I told my Boss to go fck himself.

I've had conflicts with varying intensities.

I told different people that they are assholes and they should go fck themselves. I even told it to my own mother.

I was afraid to death.
I was so much afraid of a confrontation, I just wanted to die.

I was shaking, I felt sick, I was almost crying while confronting them.

Do you know what happened after I done it?

I felt euphoric. The anxiety was gone. I could smile again, I could eat and sleep again, 
I could look in the mirror without feeling bad.
My self esteem was back.
People suddenly had respect for me.

All my life I was told that I have to be kind and friendly to others. I was told that violence is a no go. I was told to never escalate but deescalate.

I promised to myself I will never be a coward again. Even if it means death.

I solved the anxiety issues, but I can't overcome my mistrust for humans to this day. I think it's a task for one of you.

Good luck and best wishes."

Here's a scenario with a particular friend.

I ask him if he's available to hang a week in advance. He tells me 'I'll let you know.'. 3 days before my proposed date, he says ""Sorry, I can't confirm anything with you until I confirm something with my other friends that may or may not be happening at the same time."" So that immediately signals to me that I'm the backup friend. 1 day before the event, I get a message ""Hey, you free tonight instead? My other friend hasn't said anything."" I mean, I was free, but it felt a bit icky just suddenly changing plans like that like my time wasn't worth the same as this 'other friend'.

When we do meetup that day, he tells me a story about one of our mutuals, how the mutual wasn't doing well so he offered his house and a place to vent for the night. And I'm wondering, ""Would he do the same for me?"" I've definitely had some anxious breakdowns and communication style discussions with him before, about how he responds to the mutual much faster while I get left on delivered/read for a couple days or how he laughs/reacts to the mutuals messages in the group chat more often than my own messages. But all I get are assurances that this is how he treats all his friends.

So now I'm unsure where I stand with him. Am I just overthinking our interactions? On the grand priority scale of friends, am I just lesser than the mutual even though we all met at the same time? And lesser than the 'other friends' too? Are we even friends?"

There is millions of us who suffer daily from stupid thing called anxiety. 

Little back story from myself below 

So 2021 when i started getting anxiety and panic attacks due to my health anxiety i assume. Suffered from those long time and finally 2022 it started going better but i didnt know what made it go better. Year 2023
Started awful and it was back. But this time even worse.. living was so bad, i couldnt get up from my bed without feeling shit. 

I didnt visit doctor once because i believed i can find cure by myself. Tried everything from breathing tactics, no caffeine, good sleep, no stress and so on. I didnt wanna touch actual medicine because their shit. 

FINALLY after reading everysingle thing in internet i found out vitamin B12 and Folic acid (B9) deficiency could be reason why most of us suffer from anxiety, especially generalised anxiety. Just imagine. 

Went to buy both in same pill form, and guess what? 
Anxiety boom gone after 2 days of eating them. Like no joke. This is my 7th day without single feeling of anxiety. 
I have no words how i feel, like how it feels like to be normal without having thing behind your ear listening ur racing heart and just generally feeling awful. 

Obviously everyone is different and suffer from different reasons but please go and buy B12+B9 vitamin and give it an shot. Cost absolutly nothing. 

I wish you all happy new year 2024 ‚ù§Ô∏è."
190dn1f,Anxiety,2024-01-06,How do you know?,"
I‚Äôve been in a bad rut with my anxiety for about a month now. I‚Äôm a 30 year old female. I finally started on an SSRI (lowest dose). Recently I‚Äôve seen people saying you can become manic from SSRIs with or without bipolar disorder. I‚Äôve never been diagnosed as bipolar, but the more I read the more I question. I‚Äôve always been a very bubbly, high energy, loud, fast mover, I‚Äôve always dealt with anxiety, but not like this time. How would I know if I‚Äôm bipolar, or if I have been manic and just thought it was me being normal? It has consumed me and I am petrified of it. Thanks! I have an appt on Tuesday with a psychiatrist I just wanted some others thoughts and experiences."
190di2b,Anxiety,2024-01-06,Anyone Changed Jobs &amp; It Was Better?,"So I have a 9-5 office job and have now faced ultimate burn out. For context my anxiety exploded in April and I have had constant big issues from there.

My job hasn‚Äôt helped and I ended up being signed off sick. They haven‚Äôt treated me the best and it‚Äôs very toxic in the office and after 4 years there I feel it‚Äôs enough. I‚Äôm scared to go back and face the toxic guilt trip and even though the pay is decent I wanna leave.

I‚Äôm going to change my career and do something different that I love to do which means I won‚Äôt be stuck in the office all day however it means taking a heavy pay cut which I can afford to do. Has anyone else done the same and it‚Äôs made them feel better?"
190dhq4,Anxiety,2024-01-06,Always feel like I‚Äôm unsafe and somebody is out to get me / hurt my family,"I have to get this off my chest 

Due to negative past experiences, such as being severely stalked as a 17 year old, and followed around 

I have developed severe anxiety and it has never gone away 

I‚Äôm now 25 and I still have a constant fear in the back of my mind that people are out to get me 

I know I should discuss all this with a therapist but I honestly find them useless 

This is an example of some of my negative experiences that make me feel people are out to get me : 

I had a friend who I insulted, (his dad had been m*rdrd, I once angrily asked him ‚Äúis this what ur dad taught you?!‚Äù ) , he was trying to scam me so I let off on him in anger . 

 and ever since then I feel like , even though we don‚Äôt speak anymore and it‚Äôs been a year, he is plotting against me because apparently he was so upset that I mentioned his dad. 

He stole a lot of money from me by scamming me eventually and later on he even asked me for my full house address &amp; full name 

This set off alarm bells in my head because I instantly thought he wanted revenge and to get to my house and harm my parents as a get back  

Even though I cut him off and it‚Äôs been a year I still believe he‚Äôs lurking around and will try to harm me and my loved ones 

It puts me off from posting pictures of my self on Instagram because I know he lurks on it probably don‚Äôt want to be tracked down 

I have had so many traumatising experiences that I honestly sound crazy 

I‚Äôm sick of feeling scared every day 

Any advice or suggestions?

Thank you"
190dax6,Anxiety,2024-01-06,2 months on zoloft,"Hi everyone, I‚Äôve been on Zoloft for 2 months now, was told to start at 25mg for the first week and up to 50mg on the second. Took 50mg for 2 or 3 days and decided to stay at 25mg and have been on that dose since. Overall the cons heavily outweigh the pros, the only pro is I am not waking up in the middle of the night with panic attacks. The cons Include constant nausea, cold sweats, morning anxiety, suppressed appetite, headaches/spacey feeling constantly and vision problems (am currently figuring out if it‚Äôs a prescription issue or because of this medication). I am going to speak to my doctor about switching to another alternative, maybe lexapro? I am not familiar with the many other options. I know this is a low dose and am wondering if it‚Äôs even possible to have all these issues on such a low dose, I am hoping to get some of your opinions and own experiences with this. Do I stay on this even after 8 weeks with bad symptoms that feel like they are getting worse? (I am 20M)"
190d8tv,Anxiety,2024-01-06,"Sitting next to my sleeping husband, worrying about money and health issues","I'm sure there are many of you across the world who have worked their asses off but are barely surviving in this crappy economic state: having trouble being able to afford anything from electricity to food to booking ""cheap"" holidays. *(Yes I know some of you might be thinking this is just first world problems, at least we have food and water, at least we're not in a war - but aside from that, everyone still has problems and at the end of the day it's all relative).* 

  
My husband and I haven't been on holiday for a few years - it's been eating me up a bit but it also opens up room for my brain to start panicking about other things that we can't afford either that are WAY important than going on holiday. **For starters affording treatment for my worsening back or affording the food in our fridges as well as struggling to sell things to even make like ¬£20 a month or something. On top of that I'm unable to find a new job in months after my redundancy, having a crappy landlord and an expensive place that I don't think we can survive off of my almost-spent savings and husband's low paying job.**  It's obviously not the most stressful situation as I'm sure other people are going through worse but this is it, this is my situation. 

  
I don't have any friends either and I'd like to try not mention this too much in front of my husband otherwise it just stresses him out. I'm the kind of person who needs solutions ""now"" and can't sit still until something's fixed hence why I'm just keeping my brain busy - can't sleep on this anxious brain right now.

Its hard to breath and I often hyperventilate, feel dizzy and like Im about to faint, I cant hear properly and its hard to stand. Sometimes it starts with shaky hands. There is a feeling of anxiety in my chest but not a pain that I would mistake for a heart attack. No feelings of dying but feel of no control/losing control. Last from a couple of minutes to 15 minutes max. Ive noticed I get them easier when sleep deprived or drunk.

Seems to come out of nowhere at the moment, but when analysing the situation later there is usually something that triggered it and happened like half an hour earlier or so. Or I get one after a really hectic day at work when Im walking home.

Ive learnt that forcing myself to breath out with a focus or breathing with the ""breathing triangle"" gif have helped to get me out of the situation.

I used to use weed to calm myself down, but I can't do that anymore because of drug tests for work.

I don‚Äôt usually post like this but could use some support right now if anyone has the spoons ‚ù§Ô∏è

I was diagnosed with a minor kidney infection yesterday and prescribed cephalexin. When all is said and done, it‚Äôs actually a pretty gentle antibiotic.

That being said, I have some extreme anxiety around medical things, especially taking new medication. I read a ton of scary side effects on the internet and put off taking the antibiotics until this morning. When I woke up I tossed them back before I could turn back because I am in pain and know I need to treat this. No going back now, I need to do this for 5 days.

I felt fine from the first dose but of course I have worked myself into a panic now. Dizziness, nausea, extreme anxiety.

I am not even convinced this is a side effect of the meds, I think I‚Äôm just under the weather and also panicking. I‚Äôve been too afraid to eat, and I think that‚Äôs making things worse. 

Any reassurance that I will get through these 5 days? I know overall this is a small thing, I‚Äôm just alone and struggling. 

Love you all!"

It may sound strange, but this is where the majority of my anxiety comes from. I also get it with travel.

1908f6h,Anxiety,2024-01-06,After another abrupt panic attack I can finally put what it feels like into words,"I'm not looking for specific advice, just yelling into the universe to get it out of my head.

Beyond normal anxiety I have occasional abrupt panic attacks that seem to have no cause. Yesterday being an example that lasted all day.

An hour before waking up, in the time just between dreams and awake, I was trapped in a whirlwind of insane thoughts that were out of control. It was like being trapped on Willy Wonka's creepy boat ride going at 100mph. After eventually breaking free and waking up the more physical symptoms come on. My chest feels like it's being constricted by a giant snake. No matter how many breathing exercises I do I never seem to get enough oxygen. My stomach, despite being empty, feels inflamed and engorged to almost bursting. Muscles are stiff and twitchy and my reflexes pop off at the slightest touch.

The mental side is just as unpleasant. There is nothing wrong, nothing to worry about, but I feel a persistent feeling of being hunted and everything around me is a potential threat. I'm safe, have resources, and support but can't explain what the danger is. My thoughts have (pictured in my mind) shifted from the right side of my brain to the left side of my brain. It is no longer an internal dialogue, now it is flashing images, clips of movies, random imagined scenarios changing 5 times a second. It almost feels like being forced face first through and breaking consecutive TV screens, one after the other.

The abrupt ones are the worst. I didn't reason my way into them so it's hard to reason out of them with meditation, muscle/breathing exercises. This one lasted all day and then just *snap* stopped as abruptly as it came with no explanation. The longest time it has lasted is two weeks; which of course lead to a near total mental break.

At least it feels better to get this out. Hopefully everyone is safe and managing their own trials."

I'm aware it's not the end of the world and that this is just an obstacle i have to conquer but i can't stop thinking about it. 

I've never been one to have panic attacks until 2023 when the abuse intensified, and now whenever i think about my plans i get so anxious my chest starts to go tight and my heart beats so fast and i get lightheaded and i genuinely feel like i'll just die. I've been to the hospital over it once because i was so anxious my chest was going crazy and they didn't take me seriously because my mother was in the room, so i couldn't say something like ""I think i had a panic attack i'm having really bad anxiety"". I was just told to sleep properly. I can normally quell my anxiety with breathing exercises and fresh air but i hate the heart palpitations part it feels like the end of the world.

I'm only typing this because i was just doing the dishes and i started overthinking about my plans to leave my family and my chest hurt so bad i went lightheaded and fell on the floor. So now i've been sent to bed and told to take a pill and i'm just wallowing in self pity i guess??

I don‚Äôt have a fear of flying when he‚Äôs with me, only when I‚Äôm alone.

Its been like this for a month and my doctor recently perscribed antibiots since syrups and other medication did not work. The last time I took antibiotics was when I was a kid and didnt understand what it meant to take any kind of pills, so i obviously dont remember my expirience. I dont know what pills i took as a child, but I know I didnt have an alergic reaction. I just took my pill about 10 minutes ago and I am terrified of having a reaction. 
I dont know how to stop this fear as it seems like a rational to me.

19061al,Anxiety,2024-01-06,Feeling a terrible sense of impending doom.,"Hey folks! Long post incoming (spoilers that discuss sensitive topics like mortality). Not looking for medical advice here per one of the rules, but rather seeking guidance if anyone else has been through something similar or if anyone has a different take on what I might be experiencing. 

In October of this year I came down with a case of SVT while I had strep throat and COVID at the same time (rough I know). I was seen by an electrophysiologist and had numerous EKGs and Echocardiograms done with showed no abnormalities with my heart. November went by relatively normally although I had a heightened sense of anxiety that I never had before. &gt;!Having that SVT episode felt nearly identical to a heart attack and I really had to confront the concept of mortality head on.!&lt; I had CBC, CMP, D Dimer, Troponin, Cholesterol, and A1C tests done soon after this incident which all came back normal. 

Fast forward to early December where I was having dinner with a friend and I literally felt for a moment that time skipped on me (about 1-3 seconds). I didn‚Äôt think much of it at the time but as I look back on it more, I feel like that may have been an absence seizure. I mentioned this to an ER doctor a few days ago who said it was likely anxiety but no tests were run. Since then, each day has gotten progressively worse. I have a laundry list of symptoms that‚Äôs been plaguing me and now I have an awful, impending feeling of doom for myself. &gt;!I was never particularly health anxious until lately and now I feel like every day may be my last to the point where I‚Äôm considering writing down instructions for after I pass away.!&lt; Those around me label all of my symptoms as anxiety, including doctors. I visited a Minute Clinic a week ago because I thought I was simply dealing with an ear infection but the NP said I may have had or am having strokes. An ER doctor dismissed this with a neurological test and chalked it up to COVID and anxiety. But I have a nagging feeling like something serious is going on. I have a GP appointment set up for early February but I feel like I‚Äôm racing against an imaginary clock. I‚Äôm considering going back to the ER at this point but any sort of guidance would be helpful. 

Some of my symptoms include:

- Lightheadedness that ebbs and flows throughout the day to the point that I may feel like fainting
- Trouble focusing my eyes on one thing
- Isolated headaches on the left side of my head for the last week and a half
- Tightness and pain in my neck. I also find myself hearing fluid (not sure if it‚Äôs spinal fluid) in my neck all the time
- Metallic taste in my mouth when I move or cough or sneeze
- Cool rushing sensation through head
- Tingling and cold in hands and legs
- Intense moments of deja vu as well as moments of depersonalization
- Waking up soon after sleeping gasping for air or feeling my heart pounding 
- Extremely heightened sense of impending doom"

About 4 weeks or so ago I noticed that my feet/hands have been freezing even though my body feels warm. I work outside so I chalked it up to it being winter but fast forward to now it doesn't matter if I'm inside or outside. My hands and feet are freezing. And now numbness has started. It's on and off. Sometimes will last for hours and then go away. I went to the Dr yesterday mentioned it to him along with the fact I've had trouble sleeping. Thought maybe I was deficient in iron.  He didn't seem alarmed but ordered blood work anyways. Blood work came back normal. Now I'm at a dead end. Can anyone relate to these symptoms?

1904kdd,Anxiety,2024-01-06,Feel extremely anxious and have slight pain in chest but my heart rate is low (54 BPM).,"I have a doctor's appointment on monday (in two days.)

I've had issues with anxiety and depression in the past, and I'm on antidepressants, but I'm still just.... ridiculously anxious. Just anxious about everything. 

However, I'd expect my heart rate to INCREASE when I'm having an anxiety filled day, but I just recently got an apple watch and this is the first time I've had a very anxious day since getting it and I checked my heart rate and it measures 54 BPM. That's roughly my resting heart rate (I'm an athlete. My resting heart rate when I'm sleeping is often ~50 BPM.) I'm not worried about the low heart rate, I just find it odd that I'd have such a low heart rate during an anxiety attack. My typical ""walking around doing stuff"" heart rate is 65-75 BPM. (I also checked my heart rate manually and it was, indeed, very slow.)

I do have slight chest discomfort, but nothing I haven't experienced (and told doctors about) before. It actually hurts on the right side of my chest (opposite my heart.) (It happens every time I'm super anxious.)

Any reasons for this? Again, I'll talk to my doctor about it on monday, but I figured I'd ask!

EDIT: I wasn't sitting around for a while when I checked, I was up and about cleaning. A lot of websites are like ""anxiety can cause inactivity which can cause low heart rate"" but I wasn't inactive."
1903sm7,Anxiety,2024-01-06,Supporting someone who won't acknowledge anxiety.,"I've been with my partner for 10+ years and he's someone who I would say has an anxious nature. Periods of being snappy/on edge, feeling nervous for no reason, being overly worried etc. He won't fly and won't deal with his anxiety over it etc.

Today is the 3rd time in a year he has gone to the ER due to heart palpitations, feeling nauseous, light headed. He was initially feeling faint due to over exertion exercising and I honestly think that grew into a panic attack over worries about his heart. Everytime he goes to the hospital there is nothing wrong with him physically.

I don't really know what to do to help him when he won't help himself and acknowledge that these hospital visits may be a result over mental health. Over the years I've encouraged him to meditate, go to the Dr but he hasnt done a thing. 

I can't honestly say I felt much sympathy for him today because he has never once tried to help himself. I know that's terrible of me.

What can I do to support him? What can I do better when he's having these episodes? It's hard to say, stay calm you'll be ok when he doesn't acknowledge it's at least in part anxiety.

Thanks,"

Issues came to a head this week and I think I had a panic attack although I was not feeling anxious or panicked? I was absolutely overwhelmed with emotions of anger, sadness and betrayal. My heart started racing, I felt nauseous and feint. This lasted for about 6 or 7 minutes and I was exhausted afterward. 

I have now given my notice and hoped that would alleviate some if not most of my anxiety.

Since then I have carried this heaviness with me (for lack of a better description), in my chest and stomach. I find myself in moments, where I am not busy or distracted, and all those emotions come cascading in. I have to actively concentrate on slow deep breaths, bringing my heart rate down and focusing my thoughts elsewhere.

1902d7i,Anxiety,2024-01-06,"Luvox, GAD, and Serotonin Syndrome","Hey, wanted to get thoughts about Luvox for GAD vs. OCD. My daughter (now 20) has been on Lexapro for multiple years, but it has appeared to stop helping. She also takes Buspar 10mg twice a day and we've never really been sure if that's made any difference. She has IBS so that has always been intermixed with the anxiety and complicated things. She also has Emetophobia. Mostly it shows up as fear of nausea and gagging which has sometimes been a symptom of her IBS (if she's in a lot of pain). It's all very complicated but I feel pretty confident her symptoms can be explained by the IBS, Anxiety, and Emetophobia. 

So she just had an appointment with her psychiatrist yesterday. It's the second time she's seen him and he's a resident (we have teaching hospital). Based on her descriptions of her anxiety experience (worrying about if she will vomit, basically, but also worries about her future and being scared of something happening to us--she's an only child and relies on us due to the struggles with IBS and anxiety), he thinks she has OCD, pure O type. He did not give her any assessments/questionnaires. I disagree. I'm a mental health counselor and feel pretty comfortable with my understanding of Pure O. I'm certainly willing to be wrong, but my main concern is if the medication she was prescribed--Luvox--will help her if she doesn't actually have OCD but just plain old GAD. I don't want her to spend weeks on a drug if it's not going to be what she needs. Especially because she's suffering so much right now. 

Our other concern is Serotonin Syndrome. I know it's rare but if she's cross tapering with Lexapro and Luvox AND continues to take Buspar, will the risk increase? Anyone have experience with all this? Most specifically, anyone take Luvox for GAD and not OCD?

Sorry for the long winded description. Hopefully it made sense. Thank you for any insights. "

19012om,Anxiety,2024-01-06,Don't scroll your phone if you want to curb your anxiety," 

The single best thing I ever did for my productivity, mental health, and especially my anxiety was to get off my phone.

I used to constantly scroll my phone, racking up 7+ hours of screen time every day.

What this does is overstimulate you with dopamine (the ""motivator"" chemical) making you unmotivated to do anything else besides scroll. When you're overstimulated, even normal tasks like cooking or working out seem borderline unbearable. It ruins your productivity, worsens your anxiety, and takes out the enjoyment of life.

If you have any desire to improve your life, the best place to start is by reducing your screen time. It is the one bad habit that blocks all other good habits you might have."

19007b3,Anxiety,2024-01-06,Panie and Derealization,"Hi,
Has anyone had a panic attack in which everything changed? A change in body sensation, a change in thinking, a different looking reality?
Has anyone managed to return to their original state? If so, how?"
19002d3,Anxiety,2024-01-06,ANY stimulant gives me EXTREME anxiety.,"Wanted to post and seek out anyone who feels the same. Physical stimulants, and stimulants in general. I'm 23 now, I dipped, smoked cigs, drank, occasionally smoked weed from the time I was 15 to maybe 22 when I quit everything the first time i had a panic attack. I have been sober for over a year now, I have been mellowing out and I smoked some weed. I wish weed did for me what it does for others but it kinda makes my anxiety worse. I hear CBD can help though.

I can't do nicotine anymore. I was addicted but I liked nicotine, I didn't really care. I liked to dip (smokeless tobacco) but I can't handle it anymore. I can't even smell cigarette smoke. Nicotine for me is completely out of the picture. I'm okay with it but, if I go out (lol I never go out my anxiety is too bad) and I want to drink and smoke a drunk cig I absolutely can NOT. 

I liked caffeine, I mean who doesn't? I drank one cup of coffee this morning, got to the gym and was panicking in the car in the parking lot. Made the decision to go home. That's how sensitive to caffeine I have become! like nicotine, caffeine is a no go.

Alcohol is another one, it is the lesser of the three I spoke about already. Some good days I can have a drink or two, it's nice. I don't drink so I'm a total lightweight, it's nice to get a buzz off of one beer or mixed drink, etc. However I don't like to drink too much because it can send me spiraling dowwards too. 

Overstimulation, driving, too much sunlight, crowded places, random occurances. Hell, I got a text message from a random number the other night. They had the wrong number, and I got anxious and started to panic. This is the kind of stuff I go through on a daily. I have really had to make adjustments to my life. 

Even working out!!!! This has to be one of the hardest one for me. i dont do hard cardio anymore, I just walk on the tredmill. Im way too scared to get my heart rate up. I dont think theres anything really wrong with my heart im just always anxious and the slightest thing that throws me off makes me liable to freak out, exercise included. Especially lifting, deadlifts, bench press, squat. I sometimes have to lighten it up and do more reps because doing a heavy lift, the increase in blood pressure and heart rate freak me out. 

How has anxiety effected any of your daily routines and habits? Any of you dealing with some of the same things I am? Talking about it really helps me. This reddit sub is a lifesaver... Feel free to talk about any of your unique triggers and things you've had to cut out of your life. I would love to hear them! "

18zytno,Anxiety,2024-01-06,I Don't Know Anymore,"I was diagnosed with anxiety disorder a few months ago. The odd thing is, I don't really feel any anxiety. Or at least I didn't up until now. I feel normal. But I have been having heart palpitations and MAJOR spikes in blood pressure. They put me on blood pressure pills and they seem to work for the most part, But today is different. I woke up in a cold sweat and nausea. After awhile, I wondered what my blood pressure was and sure enough, 155/95.

After weeks of improvement, I'm back at square one. I'm convinced I have something wrong with me. And now I fear I may have a stroke or heart attack any minute. I feel so exhausted. I had to quit my job right before this all occurred and now I have putrid insurance and going to the doctor has cost me a fortune. They have ran multiple tests, yet can't find anything. The cardiologist seemed like he couldn't care less. I had to switch primary physicians because my old one didn't do anything. My new one has worked hard, but we come up empty handed every time he orders tests and now he seems like he is determined it is anxiety.

And maybe it is. Maybe he is right. But my brain and body won't allow it to be right. I've had the oddest symptoms. Twitching, pain in one leg, numbness, odd sensation going through the back of my neck to my head, etc. My heart rate seems fine, but that's about it. Well, until I have a panic attack. And my panic attacks are a bit different. I don't feel short of breath, but my heart takes off and I have chest pain. Sometimes these attacks only last for a few seconds which seems to be out of the norm. I also don't feel any anxiety until one hits and then it quickly subsides.

I'm starting to feel depressed now and I honestly don't know what to do anymore. I now look at all the fun things I'm missing out on. I want to go hiking, but I'm afraid to have a massive panic attack in the woods now. I want to travel again, but I'm afraid to be away from my parents with this, who have been babying me like I'm a child again because I don't want them to leave in fear that something may happen. I went back to school, but whatever this is seems to keep me from focusing and the meds they gave me will not allow me to focus. My health is bad for my age, in which I have been trying to take steps to address.

I'm sorry, I just had to get this off my chest. Any of you have the experiences that I do? It is a very odd and debilitating disease."
18zyqds,Anxiety,2024-01-06,At a new low - What do I do?,"Hey all. I had a traumatic experience a couple of months ago, and during the last two weeks my brain has finally decided to process the trauma. I've been dealing with intense derealization and the worst anxiety I've ever experienced. Today I tried to go to sleep and woke up having a massive panic attack, and now I'm afraid to go back to sleep even though I'm exhausted. The anxiety just won't leave me alone. My roommate is going to take me to urgent care tomorrow but I'm thinking maybe I should go to the ER just to get something to help me calm down. The anxiety and dread has been in the background for almost four days now, and I can't live like this.

I am in therapy and am talking with a psychiatrist. I will see the psych again next Thursday, and he is discussing putting me on medication. I saw him last two days ago and I said I wanted to wait a week before getting on medication because for some reason I thought it would get better but it's just been getting worse and I won't be able to get ahold of him until at least Monday. Should I stay awake all night and just try my best to relax or should I go to the ER?

If anybody is willing to DM I would really appreciate it.

18zyja0,Anxiety,2024-01-06,does medication help?,"my anxiety has gotten worse, to the point where i will start to quickly hyperventilate, my stomach cramps really bad, and i feel cold while sweating whenever i encounter a social situation (even something as simple as the grocery store or the gym.) 
i have never had to take medication for anything, neither my physical or mental health. 
when i told my doctor about my anxiety, she told me about fluoxetine and how she thinks it would help, but my mother told her she wanted to research it before even considering it (i am a minor). 

i wanted to know, if i were to take this medication, would these physical symptoms (stomach pains, hyperventilation, cold sweat, feeling dizzy/sick) be affected? will it just affect my mood? will it make me feel absolutely numb or like a zombie? and, is it an addictive drug? google has not been straight with me while i was trying to figure out some of these things.

i am still not 100% how the anxiety medications work. but if something could help these awful feelings go away, then i would really want to give them a try. maybe someone who has recently started / been on this medication, or another for a while can help me out. 
im very sorry if anything in my question was maybe hard to understand! this is my first time using reddit to actually ask a question and i definitely felt anxious while typing this üòÜ

 any advice is greatly appreciated ! thank you very much"

18zx9rj,Anxiety,2024-01-06,Does someone experience similar symptoms?,"Hello, already sorry in advance, this will also be a long venting text. I have always been an anxious person, but mainly about very specific social situations, besides that it was bearable. I even travelled alone for over a year, all around the world and had genuienly the best time of my life. 
When I came back, I felt off and depressed, which is normal I guess. Then I moved away and started a new life in a new city, new studies, new job. It was harder than I thought to adjust, but still manageable, but then I caught scabies from someone. The treatment took ages (I am still not a 100% sure I am cured) and completely fucked me up. I developed panic attacks, which were not physical at first. I mainly had racing thoughts, depersonalization/derrealization and the thought that I am going crazy. This thought began to be compulsory, I checked everyday my behaviour and thoughts if I can detect something ‚Äúcrazy/mad‚Äù about it, which obviously makes no sense, but I could not stop. The only physical symptom was, that my eye did twitch a lot. And then after a while I had the first real physical panic attack: Could not breath, feeling sick and my hands began to cramp and feeling numb. I thought I‚Äôd die and called an ambulance, they calmed me down via phone. Since then I experience all the things that other people here were talking about too, but there is one thing that really stands out for me. I have those brain lightnings and sometimes little lightnings in front of my inner eye, and random muscle contractions. I was checked physically and I am okay, so it has to be mental, but it really freaks me out. Also I am on Escitalopram now, so it could be a side effect but I had the same symptoms before already. The last time I had a panic attack was because I could not sleep (definetely a side effect) and I even had a short acoustic halluzination, which led me to think I become shizophrenic.. I am so tired of all this."

18zx2gd,Anxiety,2024-01-06,Buspar,"I have been on buspar for about 2 and a half months now. I started on 5mg 2x a day, it was awful for me. took that for a month, then upped the dosage to 10mg twice a day which almost literally instantly made a difference. however, I still don‚Äôt feel normal. I still have some anxiety, I know it‚Äôs not supposed to take it completely away, but this still feels more than an average person, on top of some moderate-severe depression. and honestly the longer I‚Äôve been taking this medicine the less it feels like it‚Äôs working. I feel like I‚Äôm falling back into a very anxious state again. 

I guess my question is, does buspar work for anyone by itself? does anyone take buspar combined with another medication? do I try something in conjunction with buspar, since I haven‚Äôt been feeling 100%?"

I mention being bullied and hate crimes. briefly mentioned suicide.),"When I tell people that I'm worried about other people when I'm in public they all immediately start telling me i shouldn't worry about what other people think. that I'm strong/handsome/look fine. They don't get that my anxiety stems from the fact I'm scared people are going to hurt me. My anxiety stems from C-PTSD.

I'm a wheelchair user, i know I look like an easy target. Plus, I'm very visibly transgender and live in a very right wing and christian dominated area.

I was bullied *horribly* most of my life for being queer and autistic. I was told to commit suicide and even tried it at one point. I had people purposely trigger my deadly allergies because it was funny to watch me scramble for my inhaler and medication. I had to start wearing turtle neck shirts in school because people would rub lotion with my allergen in it on the back of my neck when i wasn't paying attention. I have been cornered and yelled at by groups of people over things. I have had people threaten me. I even had a stalker at one point thinking he could ""fix me"". 

I am scared I'm going to get hurt or killed when I'm in public. That's what my anxiety is about with people and people don't get it. Everyone thinks I'm worried about people thinking I'm weird and shit talking me. Then, i explain my actual anxiety and get told it's irrational and no one will actually try anything. I explained, very vaguely like i had in the last paragraph, that people have and got told i was trauma dumping."

One night I woke up and started having terrible full body tremors. Eventually calmed down after drinking coconut water and thought it was maybe blood sugar related. Next night same thing happened and I thought I was having seizures, so at 11:00 pm I went to the ER. The shaking had gone down immensely by then but went ahead and got an EKG and other tests with everything normal except a little high heart rate.

Is there any way to fight it?
I have no idea how I‚Äôm going to pay it. I literally thought it was an emergency, and have no past  experiences of an anxiety attack. I‚Äôd never even been diagnosed with anxiety. So how can I discern the whether it was an emergency or not?

18zugo3,Anxiety,2024-01-06,Unsupportive sibling with my anxiety and decisions,"My sister seems to have a big opinion on the dilemma I‚Äôve been having about going back to college or going to community college. 

She thinks if I‚Äôll go back to college and be away from home, I‚Äôll have another major freak out, have panic attacks all the time, be miserable basically. 

I had such bad intrusive thoughts last semester that created domino effective of issues: social isolation, burned out, which led to me wanting to be at home. I made the choice after speaking with advisors to go home in parts of November to start medication. 

My sister and I are close but she is absent sometimes at home so she doesn‚Äôt know everything. I had a really tough last week due to PMS. My therapist and I have spoken all about this and she seems to have faith in me that I know my triggers and know what caused all my issues at school. 

Meanwhile my sister thinks she knows better. She thinks I‚Äôm not being honest with myself with what I want. She thinks I‚Äôm following the crowd by going back, which isn‚Äôt true, bc I‚Äôve learned how to be independent and get through this shit on my own. She thinks my anxiety and panic attacks are still bad bc I had one the other day, however I was able to pick myself back up and feel better quickly after (which I couldn‚Äôt do before meds)  

My medication is working definitely. I have a prn when it gets bad. I know going back to school will put me out of comfort zone but I also believe I will get through the anxiety of it all. 

It‚Äôs very disappointing to hear my sister lack confidence in me. She isn‚Äôt even home enough to understand my perspective.

18ztq15,Anxiety,2024-01-06,Feel nervous whenever my mother is not here,"Sort of vague title, but it‚Äôs basically what I‚Äôm dealing with. Back in March of 2023, I had a nervous breakdown (combined with depressive episode). It was completely random and unwarranted, and literally overnight I had gone from someone outgoing, confident, and capable, to someone who couldn‚Äôt leave the house, couldn‚Äôt drive, and couldn‚Äôt go to class due to severe panic attacks and anxiety. Doctors still don‚Äôt know what caused it (two theories: either side effect of going off hormonal birth control, or stress due to grad school). 

I live at home, and for some reason my brain and body decided I could not sleep alone‚Äîsleeping alone was terrifying; being alone at all was terrifying. So, my mom slept with me for about a month. She was my rock during this time‚Äîwhen I was gagging and running to the toilet to have anxiety induced diarrhea, she would bring me water and comfort me. She‚Äôd rub my back to try and make me fall asleep, and she took days off work to be with me. 

Fast forward to now, nearly a year later, and I‚Äôm still recovering from this episode. I‚Äôm on antidepressants/anxiety meds (the same ones I took all throughout my teen years but had finally been able to stop taking in 2022), and I‚Äôm able to drive and go to class again. I still struggle with being in public spaces for too long, especially if I didn‚Äôt drive there myself and I‚Äôm reliant on someone else to take me home (I feel trapped). 

Also, I am still nervous and anxious when my mother leaves. Not during the day, as she works, but during the night. For example, she‚Äôs spending the night at her sisters house tonight, and I‚Äôve been a nervous wreck (fussy gut, nausea, sweats, restlessness). I think it‚Äôs the physical trauma from all those months ago, as the anxiety and panic were worst at night and my mom was there to help. I think I‚Äôm subconsciously nervous I‚Äôll have a panic attack while she‚Äôs not here and have to get through it on my own (which I‚Äôve had to do before, which is always terrible). 

There‚Äôs no purpose to this post, since nobody can really give me advice. It‚Äôs more of a rant to express my frustration over the lingering symptoms of a mental breakdown I had nearly a year ago. if any of you read till the end, thanks!

TL;DR: had mental breakdown 1 year ago that mom helped me through‚Äî1 year later, still get nervous when mom leaves at night. It sucks."
18ztjmb,Anxiety,2024-01-06,Long term medications?,"I am diagnosed general anxiety disorder and complex ptsd. I spent a lot of my life inside mental institution and traumatized by forced medication. That was over 10 years ago and I‚Äôve been unmedicated since except for the occasional prescribed Xanax when things get really bad. 
I am in therapy currently and my mental state is certainly way better than it was when I was a younger adult, but I feel things creeping back up on me. Panic attacks and flashbacks are returning and I am terrified of becoming dysfunctional again. 
I spoke to my therapist and she said it may not be a bad idea to speak to a psychiatrist. I no longer have a Xanax prescription and thankfully I never got addicted in a sense I abused the drug, but I really need a longterm solution.

18zslhn,Anxiety,2024-01-06,Anxiety around intrusive thoughts that I‚Äôm saying out loud at work,"I‚Äôm a teacher. I‚Äôve been doing it for years, and for the past three years I‚Äôve been consistently taking lexapro for my anxiety. I also deal with chronic pain, and more often than not, there will be a month here or there where I am prescribed pain medication that interacts negatively with my SSRI. On a good month, I‚Äôm not in pain and not taking any meds, so I have low anxiety. This keeps my OCD and intrusive thoughts in check. I‚Äôve had a couple bad weeks recently, so I‚Äôm taking the pain meds again and they are getting in the way of my mental health.

So recently the intrusive thoughts have been loud. Nothing relating to self-harm this time around, thank god. But things that are inappropriate to say out loud to high schoolers. I don‚Äôt want to be specific, but just imagine like things you would save for a conversation between adults rather than with kids. Nothing that would get me sent to jail. Nothing directed at them specifically.

Today in particular I had a really horrible Freudian slip type moment where I spoke before I could even stop the thought. (I switched a word out by accident and the switched word made a sexual pun. Ooooooops, damn it.)The kid didn‚Äôt register this on their face, and honestly, I think it was a ‚ÄúWoosh‚Äù over the head type moment. But now I‚Äôm full on shame spiraling about slipping up.

Does this happen to anybody else? Have you unwillingly let your intrusive thoughts compromise your professional integrity? How can you stop being disgusted with yourself when intrusive thoughts are inappropriate and they came out accidentally? How do you move forward from this shame productively and work on keeping those intrusive thoughts inside?"

18zsd8t,Anxiety,2024-01-06,I‚Äôm so fucking scared of driving.,"I‚Äôm 23 and I‚Äôve never driven. At all. And now my MIL says I have until the 16th to study cause she‚Äôs taking me to get my permit. After that, she wants to take me driving. 

Before anyone asks, no I can‚Äôt get out of it. Not only will it upset her, but I need to do this. My fiance has bad eyesight and can only drive during daylight. I need to be able to drive in case there‚Äôs a moment where he can‚Äôt. 

I‚Äôm scared. Every time I even think about being behind the wheel, my heart starts to pound. What if I crash? What if I hurt someone? I can‚Äôt afford to fix a car or a lawsuit. What if I panic while driving? What if I fuck something up? 

I don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôm going to manage it. My fianc√©, who just started driving himself, says it‚Äôs easy. My best friends says they were scared at first too but it‚Äôs not bad at all. They say it‚Äôs easy too. 

I just can‚Äôt believe it. How can moving a huge vehicle between other huge vehicles and bikes and people be easy? I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll be good at it. 

I need advice or reassurance or something."
18zrqrb,Anxiety,2024-01-06,Having a hard time explaining my anxiety to the normal people in my life.,"I keep saying that it‚Äôs like that moment when your driving to work in the morning and you look over at the passenger seat and realize that you left your laptop on the chair next to the front door and your halfway there and turning around is going to make this late. 

It‚Äôs like that feeling all the time and there is no reason for it. And most people placate me and say ahh ya, but I know that they have no idea. I just can‚Äôt explain it well. lol"
18zrq1f,Anxiety,2024-01-06,Thought I couldn‚Äôt get off my mind.,"Recently I have been struggling a lot with thinking too much about what strangers thought of me. It made every situation in day to day life a chore. I hated going out. I hated talking to people. I hated being anywhere but in my room alone. I say I hated it but I knew it wasn‚Äôt really what I wanted, everything else was just worse. 

Tonight I spent time with good friends who I would consider 2 of my closest friends (I probably have about 10, which I find to be the perfect amount). What I‚Äôm realizing now is that I enjoy spending time with these people so much because I can be myself around them. I don‚Äôt have to pretend to act or feel any different than how I truly want. I have known them long enough and grown close enough to them that I fully trust they accept me for my true me. 

What I mean is that sometimes the way I act is seen as weird. Like the nerdy, ‚Äúuh that guy is a geek‚Äù kind of weird. As I‚Äôve progressed through about 20 years of life I‚Äôve learned to act in ways that allow me to fit in and have friends and seem normal. 

But, I feel like in the past couple years it started becoming too hard to try to act normal while also worrying what others think. My mind would race thinking about every possible way the conversation could go. 

What I realized while thinking tonight is that it doesn‚Äôt matter what other people think because I have no idea what the hell is going on in their head. Shit I don‚Äôt even know what‚Äôs going on in mine for the most part. What I do know is I like being with people who know the true me. Anyways if you read to the end, this is my first post and I‚Äôm hoping this subreddit may be a good way for me to work through things since I‚Äôm not good at putting my thoughts into speech."

18zqjc5,Anxiety,2024-01-06,I Just Want To Know It‚Äôll Get Better,"TW: car accidents, suicidality, drugs

Never made a text reddit post but here it goes. I hope you‚Äôre all doing well. I‚Äôm not sure how much to share to contextualize but I‚Äôll put what I think is relevant. 

My mental health struggles started around the time I was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes at age 10. I (19) was diagnosed with GAD and SAD around age 13 and have done on and off cognitive-behavioral therapy since. I‚Äôve been through about five therapists and am currently seeking care, but I was told that the location accepting my insurance has a 6 month wait list, hence why I‚Äôm here right now. 

I‚Äôm currently taking Buspirone 5mg each morning and propanolol to manage my physical anxiety symptoms, but I‚Äôve only been on this regimine for about a week (I tried Lexapro but it made me physically ill and drastically increased my suicidal thoughts). Before this I was on Venlafaxine for about a year and a half, since I was 17. I fell behind on my daily dosage and long story short, got physically sick and mentally fucked from taking it one day after not taking it for a month and a half. 

I think it‚Äôs also important to mention I smoked delta 8 almost every day since April 2022 to about October 2023. At first it helped me with my anxiety, but gradually as my tolerance built, it made me feel awful. I would wake up and hit my pen first thing in the morning and try to maintain a high the entire day. It cost me so much money that I should‚Äôve been saving for college, and I‚Äôm worried about how delta itself might‚Äôve impacted my health. However I haven‚Äôt smoked it in a few months and I‚Äôm happy to say I never want to ever again. 

The turning point of my mental health getting gradually worse was when I got into a minor accident the first time I tried to drive to my college campus by myself. It was a very small accident of me hitting someone from behind, going about 15-20 mph. I have not driven outside of my small hometown since, and I haven‚Äôt drove anywhere in about three months. My anxiety, both mentally and physically, has gotten so much worse over these three months, to the point where I‚Äôve gotten physically sick multiple times because my anxiety was so bad. This has never happened to me before. I‚Äôm starting to skip out on events with friends and family because I can‚Äôt handle being in a car. 

There is so much more I could say about my situation, but my post is mainly just to give myself some clarity. I haven‚Äôt had a therapist since October and I‚Äôve been holding onto these thoughts for too long. So this is my attempt to connect with people again, people that I know have similar experiences to me. I‚Äôve felt terribly alone recently and I want to try and fix that. 


I‚Äôm very scared about my future. But I‚Äôm going to try and take care of the things that actually are under my control. If anyone has any advice for dealing with anxiety in the car, I would greatly appreciate it. I have issues concentrating on tasks to distract me (like reading or playing a game), so I‚Äôm wondering if anyone has any other tips. I hope you all have a good night. Thanks for reading."

These strange symptoms first happened about ten yrs ago after several hours of great conversation and laughing with friends.  When driving home, I noticed extreme rigidity throughout my body, twitches and palpitations that lasted for hours.  This has continued to happen over the years in similar circumstances.

18zpp5a,Anxiety,2024-01-06,Struggling with the concepts of the universe and what life actually is,"Around 2 months ago I got high as fuck  and was with my university friend who does physics and I asked him just basic physics questions. This just lead me to watch a bunch of documentaries and YouTube videos about the universe and creation of it and it‚Äôs just consumed me , at first in a good curious way. However now all I can think about is the questions that I still haven‚Äôt got an awnser for and all the questions that people , who are supposedly experts, don‚Äôt know the awnser too. I don‚Äôt know why I feel the urge to know it , I understand that it‚Äôs an extremely complex topic but I just find it so frustrating that so much is unknown and that I may never get to know the awnsers to these questions which encompass our whole existence within my lifetime.I got even worse today after I saw the same friend, even though I‚Äôve watch so many vids on these theories and shit I still feel just as lost with my place and with the questions I have - like I have no clarity at all.  I‚Äôve always suffered with anxiety , but I kind of feel like (while it‚Äôs still been consuming me abit with the thoughts I stated earlier) this anxiety is actually really reasonable and a lot of other people go through it. It would also be nice if people could leave book suggestions around this , could be philosophical /scientific etc"
18zpfwa,Anxiety,2024-01-06,Anxiety Physical symptoms,"Sorry for the long post in advance‚Ä¶ Not sure how to start this but here goes. I‚Äôve always known i‚Äôve had anxiety my whole teenage / adult life, however the last few years have had physical symptoms that have led me to believe i may have more serious health issues. I‚Äôm going to list some symptoms I have, as i‚Äôm generally curious if anyone else experiences these on a regular basis, and if so how you were able to overcome them. 

- Difficulty Concentrating 
Mainly notice this when i‚Äôm driving, almost feels like my eyes are slow to move around if that makes sense. I also notice this when talking to certain people where it feels like i can‚Äôt really focus on everything they may be saying. Also noticed when i play video games. 

- Weird Pressure feeling on side of head 
This is one of my most difficult symptoms, where it‚Äôs not a headache but more of a heavy feeling on one side of my head. This feeling will last days and then go away and come back etc. This also ties into not being able to concentrate. I will occasionally get headaches but not a daily occurrence and those are usually linked to higher anxiety situations/days.

- Eye Twitch 
Once and a while my eye will twitch and it‚Äôs just a weird annoying feeling

- Light sensitivity 

- Depersonalization / Feeling of life not being real

-Brain Fog 

- Fatigue


These symptoms are on and off which makes me think they relate to anxiety, they also get worse in social encounters. (definitely have social anxiety) But for reference i am a 23 year old male, and these symptoms really started occurring in 2020. I first noticed these after smoking a lot of weed one night which led to me feeling very weird and sort of chasing what i now realize as a panic attack. ( haven‚Äôt smoked in over a year now ) The brain fog really started after that, along with difficulty breathing for a week or so. At the time i thought i had covid but that was negative. I also have health anxiety where these symptoms make me think i have either a brain tumor or something more serious. I‚Äôm just generally sick of not feeling 100%, and want my normal life back. I have had bloodwork etc and everything comes back normal and my dr has said i‚Äôm totally healthy. I do not want to take any sort of pills and have thought about therapy but not sure how much that would help.

Any advice is greatly appreciated, and again very sorry for this being so long. Have a nice new year everyone. üôèüèª"
18zpcnq,Anxiety,2024-01-06,COVID with anxiety is hell,"My anxiety levels usually run high, which can often affect breathing.

I've had COVID for 8 days and I'm trying to get over it, but the virus seems to exacerbate my breathing and anxiety problems.

I have to go back to work next week and don't know how I'm going to do it."
18zpaqr,Anxiety,2024-01-06,Chronic anxiety without regular sex,"Hi all,

If my wife and I go more than 2 days without sex, my anxiety skyrockets. I get moody, sad and even depressed and feel hopeless.

My wife is amazing and it's not that I'm getting rejected or we aren't happy - life just gets in the way. We go out late, she's tired, the kids are up late, etc.

Any idea why my anxiety gets like this? When we have sex again, I'm completely fine and back to my happy, optimistic self. But with no sex for more than 2 days, I feel like it's a ""doomsday"" event and all I can focus on is that we haven't had sex for however many days it's been.

If anyone knows what this is (GAD? Something else?) or has any tips on how to fix/deal with it, I'd love to hear from you. It's been happening for maybe a year or so..."
18zosv4,Anxiety,2024-01-06,Upping medicine dosage?,"When did you decide it was time to up your medicine dosage? I‚Äôm going through a stressful period at work right now, and it seems my anxiety went from a 1-2 back to a 5-6 on the daily again. I‚Äôve been on Sertraline 50mg for about 3 months now. 

I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs different for everyone, but just curious about others experiences. My next therapy session in Jan 26th, so I‚Äôm trying to hold off on contacting my doctor until I speak to my therapist first."
18zornc,Anxiety,2024-01-06,finally out of my panic,"I am finally feeling okay again after a week from HELL when it comes to my anxiety. For awhile I didn‚Äôt feel like my escitalopram was doing as well as it used to, so my doc and I made a plan for me to wean off to try something else instead. About 4 weeks into it, almost completed weaned off, I injured my foot falling down the stairs. the X-Ray results I got 3 days later made me SPIRAL. Started escitalopram again. Finding out I had a ‚Äúdisplaced‚Äù fracture, along with virtually no anxiety meds in my system‚Ä¶ to say I was a mess is an understatement. 
Every morning I would wake up in a panic, heart beating like crazy. I had 0 appetite, the only thing I was able to force down was done plain bread. I‚Äôve never experienced something so scary and debilitating, and it‚Äôs so insane to me that it was all because of my head. Virtually no pain in my foot and things could have been sooo much worse. Usually counting my blessings makes me feel better, not even TV was distracting me. I felt like I had no escape besides sleep. That turned into being afraid to wake up. I was struggling so, so hard, and it felt like it was for no reason. 
I have an amazing doc who was able to prescribe some fast acting anxiety meds, and BOY did they help üò≠ I actually feel like I can breathe again. I know to only take as needed and I‚Äôm very cautious about this kind of thing, but it‚Äôs nice to have in case the panic comes back before my regular meds kick back in. 
That state of panic, anxiety, stress, whatever it was - that was horrrrrrid. If anyone reading this feels that way, please know that you‚Äôre not alone. You just need to hold on, it will get better. Modern medicine has come such a long way and I am just so thankful as a person whose brain chemicals are constantly imbalanced. This is starting to sound like an ad for big pharma lmaoo but I really just am so grateful that something helped me."

I started 7.5 mg 2 po daily of buspar and I feel like I am on my way out.  When does this dizziness subside?"
18zoiec,Anxiety,2024-01-06,I think I made a small scratch on some metal on the base of a 30 foot tower with cameras on it at work. I'm having extreme anxiety.,"A couple days ago I was leaving work and I heard a small noice when I drove, sometimes my car makes a squkey noise, but I wasn't sure, so I got out of my car and looked at my car to see if I hit something, or not. I couldn't see any damage to my car, so I went near this large piece of equipment that has a camera tower and I looked around there and I didn't notice anything, one of the yellow brackets on there looked in a different position, but I checked and it moves freely to any positions, so I realized that I couldn't of hit that, I left my job because I didn't see anything wrong with anything after I checked. A couple days later I was working and passed by and I see a small chip in the paint on one of the yellow brackets that I didn't see there when I looked last time. Now I'm having anxiety over possibly getting fired over it because it might look like on camera that I left after hitting it, but I didn't see anything on my car, or around that area where I parked. It's missing yellow paint, and has black on it. I looked at my car,and I don't see yellow paint on there that happens to be missing from that yellow bracket. It's really small and they probably won't check the 24 hour footage that runs each day just for a small amount of missing yellow paint from the bracket on the camera tower, but I'm really scared I might lose my job because of it. Especially because I just now noticed after a couple of days and I never said anything on the first day because I didn't see it. I also don't want to take responsibility for something I might not even have done. It looks like the camera towers can't see from the angle with the big solar panels in there, but they can definitely see me checking of I did anything and leaving, I'm having really bad anxiety over this. Which maybe potentially something they're not even going to care about.  Some guy saw me checking my car, and asked if I hit anything, or if my car was damaged, because he saw me hop out and look at my car. I told him ""I can't see anything on my car""."

She makes more than me which was why she suggested it so I was like cool and went to the website while she sat next to me to tell me how to sign up. I sat for a while trying to login to my H&amp;R Block account, and having not logged into it since tax season I didn‚Äôt remember the password, which I said ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt even think I remember the password‚Äù out loud. She says ‚ÄúNever mind‚Äù and quickly walks out my room back into her room going on with the evening. I was just‚Ä¶confused.

She didn‚Äôt exactly say it in a mean way it was just abrupt and idk it just felt like she was trying not to seem impatient but didn‚Äôt hide it well.

I didn't realize I had anxiety until I talked with some friends who have been diagnosed, and they say mine is worse than theirs. Where do I start? I'm assuming just a general checkup.

18zm8z8,Anxiety,2024-01-06,I have scelerophobia(fear or criminals),"This started in the countryside when our back garden and garage was broken into by teenagers who stole my brother‚Äôs motorbike(both happened different times). I would be scared of being left alone at home and would always hear things, and would stop and listen if someones in or not. Somehow I got over it after a while. Fast forward when I moved to London, was walking to a friend‚Äôs house at 1 am with 2 other friends. Happened in WestLondon, it was dark, about 8-10 black teenagers were following us asking what phone we had, at first I didnt think they were asking with the intention of robbing us because I had never been in such situation. My 2 other friends got away and I was the only one who got caught, took my phones, wallet even my slides lol. They pinned me on the ground and 5 girls were surrounding me, the others were boys, one of the girl was demaning for my password with a pointed scissors pointing 1cm away from my eyes. Had no choice but to give it to them. Police came 20 mins late, they were no help at all. 

So, after all this. I now have fear of every type of criminal possible, I get anxious when I think about getting killed or stabbed. I would always watch and read about crimes in london and my area and get anxious reading it.

18zlxvv,Anxiety,2024-01-06,I did it!,"I've been chronically lonely for a looong time. So i decided to make an effort to change that and went to a book lovers event. I had a blast. I met so many nice people with whom i talked until my tongue went numb. I felt like i could fly.
It's very important to mention i was completly terrified about going 
""What if i get there too late?"" I thought. Ended up wasting 6$ on an uber instead of a 25 min walk just so im not late. 
I get there, I realize i dont know anyone or even how anybody looks( including the coordimator). I try to message her, she doesnt answer. I get even more stressed, i think ""maybe its a traffiking scheme"" Im terrified people think im crazy for walking around aimlessly, im too coward to even ask anyone if they are there for the event or just coffee. 
Then the coordinator shows up, leads us all to our area and we all have the time of our lives. Up to that point, i was so stressed I felt sick and really wanted to just call it quits at times. 

But i didn't

I pushed through, and it was worth it."

18zkvgq,Anxiety,2024-01-05,Going off meds after a long time?,"So I was diagnosed years ago with General Anxiety Disorder, but I know after living with it for years that it's almost exclusively health anxiety focused. I've been on Lexapro since 2006, first starting with a tiny 5mg dose before going to 10mg a few years later. 

Now in my 40s I'm still just 'managing' with very few panic attacks, but I'm realizing it isn't really solving it for me. It also resulted in weight gain that, among other things, is more stubborn and unhealthy as I age (as well as loss of libido).

I've never done therapy of any kind, though. Not because I'm opposed to it but because thinking and talking about the anxiety is itself an anxiety trigger. 

That said, I'm considering swapping Lexapro for therapy. I realize both might be better but I do want to lose the side effects of the meds as well. 

Any advice for replacing meds with therapy, and any stories of someone leaving Lexapro after something like 17+ years?

Thanks"

18zkemh,Anxiety,2024-01-05,Any advice about my completely irrational anxiety about school,"I just want any advice, or suggestions of what works. I am 16 and have been dealing with awful anxiety for ages.

For the last 2/3 years, I have been gagging or throwing up, tight chest, teeth chattering, hands shaking, numbness in my arms and legs, permanently locked/clicky jaw, feeling light-headed and from the second I wake up I have a pain in my stomach and I often wake up early because of it. My symptoms used to be more mild and I would only throw up in very high-stress circumstances (before an exam) but over the last few months 95% of days I have had pretty extreme symptoms ones I usually get before exams just because I have that lesson at some point in the day.

My anxiety is due to a single subject - I'm very good at this subject, I enjoy it and have completed all of the content we need to know 2 years early, so there really is no reason for me to feel this way but I still do. I'm exposed to this feeling every day sometimes multiple times a day as I never miss school so exposure therapy is doing nothing even when I'm halfway through the lesson and I KNOW it's going to be fine and all of my other lessons have been fine I still feel awful. 

My anxiety is also made a lot worse by my physical symptoms I dread going to school in case I throw up in front of teachers or students so more anxiety and I struggle with breathing exercises because of my tight chest and I expect to feel awful now it has become a normal experience in my day to day life so I guess I worry by default.

Because I'm so used to worrying during breaks my health anxiety kicks right in, I've had it all my life, but when I'm off of school I spend the whole time convincing myself I have any disease under the sun.

I've tried writing things down, accepting it, exposure, chatting to friends, meditation, breathing work, and counting - basically every self-help thing you can do.

Haven't told my parents anything so I haven't been to a GP or anything to get professional help but if they prescribe medication which I would like as it seems like the only solution I'm scared of the side effects or getting addicted. Is it just best to suck it up and speak to my parents to see a doctor?

Thinking that maybe I ""strained"" my nervous system to trigger this, I have been resting whenever I could and mostly reading, meditating and listening to soothing music but it hasn't improved.

So today, when I got really bad sensory overload at a crowded bar, I said fuck it. I decided to stay. For 2 hours my nervous system stayed in overdrive. Chest was all contracted, hands sweaty, shaky legs, jaw clenched. I went through waves of bad anxiety, often feeling on the edge of panic. It never got to an actually comfortable level but I didn't flee. Afterward I even went to a restaurant to get some food, still feeling quite uncomfortable. 

Now I got home and I feel super exhausted from being fully on for 3 hours.

Am I doing it right? Or am I overexerting with the exposure? Will saying ""fuck it"" lead to desensitizing my nervous system back to normal levels? Or can I actually overdo it and make my anxious episode last longer?"

TW: drug overdose, death  
Hi there,  
I'm a 32 female, 5'2, overweight most of my life, I have PCOS and elevated blood pressure. I was diagnosed with GAD when I was 20 years old by my therapist who I still see now, just not as regularly even though I should. I have been ""fine"" for years, meaning if I had anxiety I couldn't tell...I have read that as you get older it can manifest in different ways than when you were younger. My mom died in July of 2021 and even though it was a heartbreaking thing and rough for both me and my family...I think by now we're starting to slowly heal from it. I know healing takes time and to not rush it and grief lasts a lifetime, my mothers death still has an impact on me. She was 58 when she died of CHF (side note she had diabetes years before and also overdosed 2-3 times on her antidepressants when she was around 50-52 years old which her doctor said did substantial damage to her heart.) I got COVID back in February 2023 and when I tell you I am terrified of Covid...there aren't words to describe it. So many people have died from it and I knew a coworker who caught COVID and then 2 weeks later died of cardiac arrest. It pissed me off because I still do all and everything to avoid COVID, I mask, use hepa filters, stay away from big crowds and when horrible surges (like right now) happen I never eat inside restaurants. I also have been jobless for about 6 months (recently got hired) and during that time I felt worthless and useless because my husband was the only one bringing home the money. Im sorry Im ranting, now let's get to why Im actually writing...a few months ago I had surgery TWICE to get a fistula fixed. I had to get an EKG and it had that prompt writing on top that said ""possible left ventricular enlargement"" and ""possible right bundle block"" Long story short I freaked the F\*ck out. My surgeon, anesthesiologist, and my PCP all looked at my EKG and assured me there was absolutely nothing to worry about, so that made me feel better. What's been bothering me since then is the fact that my blood pressure has been between 130/90-145/97 every time I've gone to the doctor. My PCP did prescribe me one medication for it and I have been taking it every morning. I feel like I'm overreacting because I have a good 80-90 pounds to lose and I have the blood pressure I do because I weigh what I do, it comes with the territory if you have extra weight. MY anxiety is telling me that COVID caused my higher blood pressure and that there's nothing I can do about it and will just die of a heart attack or stroke in the next 5 years. I have been walking a lot more, eating healthier, and when I REALLY need it I take a clonopan because sometimes I feel like Im going to hyperventilate into a coma or something. Now that I type it out it seems a little silly...but this is anxiety Reddit and I was wondering if any of you have gone through anything similar or you have any good, positive stories to share with me, or any encouragement? I would greatly appreciate it and thank you for reading. "

18ziju8,Anxiety,2024-01-05,Scared of Heart Pain,"At first, my blood pressure started to rise, so I thought I had to go to a cardiologist to see if there was something wrong with my heart. After all the tests and determining that there was nothing there, I was left with the simple answer of ""you have something, but it's not the heart"".   
A couple of months later I had the symptoms again, even going to the emergency room 2 times for elevated blood pressure. I changed cardiologist and he asked me to repeat all the tests, as he did not make sense of the previous results.   
So we came to the same conclusion as before, everything was fine with the heart, but this time the answer was that I had to see a Psychiatrist, since it was for a Generalized Anxiety Disorder. While I was getting the time he gave me Bisoprolol 5mg to take daily with breakfast.  
I managed to see a psychiatrist and he prescribed Pregabalin 150mg (75mg x 2) and Fluoxetine (100mg). He told me that I could slowly start the treatment along with the Bisoprolol while I waited for an hour with the cardiologist to lower that medication. The thing is that I have been feeling very bad taking the 3 medications together, my heartbeat is around 47 beats per minute during the day, I feel dizzy, very sleepy and last night I could not sleep because of a strong pain in my chest, like angina. My chest and arms were burning, when I got up I got dizzy and started sweating cold.   
I don't know what to do. During the day I have measured my heartbeat and it doesn't go over 60 beats per minute. Every now and then my chest hurts. Should I stop taking the medicine?"

Everyday I wake up like an hour or two before my alarm due to anxiety about the day ahead. I had my 6 months meeting with my boss today who is nice. He told me what he wants from me in 2024 and it has caused my anxiety to sky rocket! He noticed that I am reluctant to help out on the sales counter and answer the phone. I didn't tell him it's because I have GAD and SA. I just told him it's because I don't know what the customers are asking. We sell thousands of different products and I have no knowledge what so ever about them. I went to college to do office work, not this stuff.

18zhcvy,Anxiety,2024-01-05,Physical Anxiety?,"This is a long post... I'm gonna kind of go into detail about what happened to me June 2023. I had a fever for a few days with no other symptoms. Woke up on day 4 dizzy and neck aching. The ER said nothing about the neck pain but prescribed me cyclobenzaprine anyways. They said my bloodwork implied a virus and said to let it run its course. 
A month later I still had dizziness and neck pain even though the illness had passed. I was watching an episode of Mayans MC which was graphic and made me feel a little anxious when suddenly my throat tightened and I felt like I was gonna pass out and couldn't breathe good... my husband rushed me to the ER. I was still feeling constricted of air and basically dizzier than before and my neck pain turned into feeling like my head was going to explode (almost felt drunk too honestly) and I couldn't swallow nor was I producing saliva at that point, my jaw tensed up so bad (I couldn't eat or talk much for several days after) They did a CT Scan with contrast, didn't find anything, they gave me benadryl and it did nothing and then they gave me valium which helped a fair amount. My airways from the moment I got in there were clear and my oxygen level was perfect... anyways.. they sent me on my way with wanting me to follow up for dysphagia and thats it.
Now in July I'm at my PCP, he sends me to a TMJ specialist, and ENT &amp; A spine specialist. We try to cover all bases. My MRI on my neck came back with tiny tiny bulging discs in my upper cervical spine no neural impingements but both the specialist and PCP said you could take a huge sample of people and almost everyone will have one. He said it was minuscule and there was nothing to be worried about nor was it causing me these problems. My MRI did also show muscle spasm as well which was noted but wasn't addressed.. my PCP said it's obviously neck muscle strain and sent me to PT. While doing PT twice a week, certain exercises would start making it hard to swallow. But never really fixed anything. The ENT scoped down my throat in office and said all was good. TMJ Specialist cone beam scan was fine, while I have had TMJ my whole life, what I have experienced there's not really any reason to fix it. Its just a painless popping.
Its now been 7 months and my neck still randomly flares up causing jaw tension too, but it like makes me randomly slightly dizzy still or woozy and I randomly feel like I can't swallow which makes me hyper-fixate on it probably making it worse. My neck gets so tense that I end up feeling like my head is too heavy for my body. All this is exacerbated by driving, being in social situations, stress, etc. 
Now my doctor thinks its just anxiety. That I may not feel like I have anxiety (because I don't feel anxious I know what anxiety feels like in the past) but I'm just having the physical symptoms of anxiety. Sometimes I feel randomly panicky when my neck is inflamed but it comes on its own. Very rarely. 
I guess my question is, does this SEEM like physical anxiety?! I've had so many tests done from bloodwork 5 times in 7 months, to MRI's to, CT's with and without contrast... and nothing ever comes of it. My bloodwork has always shown ""inflammation"" they say. But nothing else to be concerned about. 
Could this potentially be physical symptoms of anxiety only without the feeling of being anxious?! Or does this sound like something is being missed somewhere?! 
I don't like taking meds, I have never liked taking them unless absolutely necessary. I have always tried the natural route. So honestly the thought of being on meds for anxiety makes me stressed.
I will add that the past 14 months have been stressful as my child came forward with some awful things the other bio parent was doing and it has turned into a felonly criminal case that's far from over and civil case of taking away custody and a lifetime protective order, then she developed Psychogenic Non-epileptic Seizures from addressing the trauma, so there's been a lot going on in the background of our lives. I went through therapy myself during this time because it was a lot for me and I also did EMDR therapy and was feeling better and then a month after completion my health does this. 
I guess i'm just looking to see if this is normal and could really be physical anxiety. Not needing a diagnosis just needing help understanding if this really could be that. I'm tired of feeling like something is being missed. I've advocated for myself so hard and feel defeated."
18zh3dv,Anxiety,2024-01-05,Anxiety is your body‚Äôs alarm system telling you that something is wrong.,"I just read ‚ÄúBuilding a Non-Anxious Life‚Äù and wow. This has completely changed how I look at my anxiety. 

Anxiety is your body trying to tell you that something is wrong. This can be something physical, mental, or both or even something completely different. The idea is to find the cause and work towards it. Not just putting out the alarms. 

I highly recommend everyone in this sub dealing with anxiety to check it out. My anxiety is not fixed, but I have made so much progress discovering where it‚Äôs coming from and why it‚Äôs happening."
18zh014,Anxiety,2024-01-05,How concerned should young men be about PSSD when considering starting an ssri for anxiety?,"I am a 23 year old 6' 160 pound male with anxiety, asthma and have dealt with post concussion syndrome in the past.

My anxiety was very manageable for years and I had no holdbacks in day to day life until a couple months ago when I experienced a massive spike out of nowhere. It started with full body physically debilitating anxiety whenever I would go out in public then evolved to daily constant panic attacks for a short time and now has improved but I still deal with a very significant baseline anxiety on a near daily basis, besides the odd day where I may feel better naturally or when I take a klonopine (once or twice per week over the past month). 

I am kinda against long term medication overall but in this case I really want my old life back and it just seems like its so hard to get rid of this stubborn layer of baseline anxiety that grips me constantly. I am in therapy and considering starting a ssri but am afraid of permanent sexual side effects or the condition known as PSSD. I cant really seem to get a good assessment on how common and how medically 'real' this condition. I have asked 3 seperate doctors as well as my therapist and non of them had heard of the condition so they could not really help me much.

If I do not take the medication is there anyway for me to get through this stretch and get back to how I was naturally? I am also gonna do a blood test today to see if I might have any deficiencies cause this current stretch of super intense anxiety kind of popped up out of nowhere. Any more advice would me much appreciated."
18zgo7c,Anxiety,2024-01-05,I have been diagnosed with RVOT PVCs,"To start off, I m a 29yr old female diagnosed with PCOS for 5+ years. My weight is 80kg and my BMI is 29.6. My height is 165.5cm.


I started getting this skip beats feeling in my chest in June 2023. At first I thought its just my stomach acting up but that sensation didn't stop. So i eventually checked my pulse and realised my heart is not beating normally. I was paranoid. Eventually I realised its skipping beats. For a few months I spent my days stressing and overthinking. I asked my doctor friends if they had any idea and they all told me its all in my head &amp; its probably anxiety/stress induced. I kept getting skip beats for months, every single day. On October 6th 2023, I decided to get a 24h Holter test done along with an echocardiogram &amp; stress test. I was scared but during my holter test, I could feel my heart skipping beats NON STOP. 

Eventually my results came in. During my stress test, I didn't get any PVCs but in the rest period, I had continuous PVCs. My heart size is normal, the electrolytes came back normal, no thyroid issue either.  

The doctor told me I had RVOT PVCs and there is nothing to worry about. Its probably stress induced.
I returned home and just like any human being, I went to google for research. Fun fact, I don't drink coffee, I don't smoke, I don't drink alcohol, I don't do drugs, I don't have any sorts of allergies hence no meds. Yes I don't exercise at all due to the hormonal changes caused by PCOS and the fact that I had non-stop periods for an year and was anaemic (8.8) but took iron supplements to compensate for the blood loss. 

I always wondered if I had PVCs during sleep (I am not aware of them as I m sleeping) and the holter test was also a little messed up (maybe printing mistake or something) but the doctor didn't point out any abnormality so I assumed I don't have any PVCs during sleep.

Fast forward to Jan 2024, I asked my sister to check my pulse when I am asleep and she informed me that my heart skip beats while I m in deep sleep too. 

I snore at night. Not continuous but I do. However I don't have any issue sleeping or breathing (I guess). I am not sure whats causing the PVCs. I m worried if something will happen to me. What is the doctor misdiagnosed me? What if I have sleep apnea? What if I have a heart issue? Maybe its related to my PCOS? I try my best to be positive everyday but when I feel the skip beat, I lose all my energy and I become anxious &amp; depressed. 

I get PVCs when I go to the washroom, I get them before, during &amp; after meals, I get them lying on my back or on my left side. The frequency is less when I lay on my right side. 

Anyone here who could shed some light on my situation?"
18zgi35,Anxiety,2024-01-05,Meds and muscle tension,"So, like many of us, I hold lots of muscle tension in my neck and shoulders.  When I take something that works quickly (in this case, a beta blocker), I feel much more calm, but my neck and shoulders also feel more sore than usual...often to the point of a slight headache going up the back of my neck from my traps and up.  

I'm wondering if this is really because they've always been sore, but I'm noticing it more because the rest of me (including my mind) is more ""loose,"" so I'm just noticing the tension more.  Anyone else experience anything like this?"

18zg30q,Anxiety,2024-01-05,I regret ignoring my anxiety,"So ever since I was 13 or 14, I've been dealing with anxiety and since then, it was never too bad and usually, the worst that came out of it was things like overthinking or having a weird feeling in my stomach 

But recently, after constantly worrying and becoming overly anxious for the past 3 months due to recent events in my life but doing nothing about it and just ignoring it like I always have, it's started to affect me physically and causing me problems such as constipation, stomach bloating/pressure, body aches, night sweats as well as trouble sleeping and even my overthinking has gotten worse as well (thanks to google)

This past week, I thought those physical problems had gone away or least, calmed down by a lot because i was starting to calm down and feel better but for the last few days, it seems to have come back (although, not nearly as bad as before currently)

Has anyone else dealt with something like this?"
18zg05n,Anxiety,2024-01-05,DAE pick on their body? Is it a sign of concern?,"I compulsively pick on my lashes, brows, nails, scabs, pimples, scars, anything that is ""removable"" basically. I also have this habit of filing or rubbing my nails together, cutting calluses on my hands and feet. I've had problems with bruxism for a long time now. Teeth grinding, chewing on inner cheek and tongue, nibbling on my lips, chomping of teeth for the sake of making a biting sound. Also including plucking out body hair which seems ""loose"", cracking joints and knuckles. 

If I don't do any one of these activities at least once a day I think I'd go insane. I don't have any obsessive thoughts related to this, I'm not picking on my body because I fear something. It's more of 1. It sorta calms me down, 2. I feel irritated and impatient to do these activities already like what's stopping me? Nothing so why not do it?? 3. I've been doing this for a very long time so trying to stop seems almost impossible."

I saw a meeting on boss‚Äôs boss‚Äôs calendar that evening called employee problem and I got worried that he was gonna get fired. The next day he showed up but was fired due to attendance issues (I think he‚Äôs depressed and had been sleeping in like once every 3 weeks).

I love my manager. He was so great to work with. I sent him a text and tried to call him but he didn‚Äôt respond (the call went for 6 seconds and then got dropped??). I know he‚Äôs trying to take the time to process it but I‚Äôm really worried about him because I suspect he has depression. I‚Äôm scared he did something bad to himself.

I wasn‚Äôt able to sleep last night. I just really hope he‚Äôs ok.

UPDATE 1: Talked to people at work and no one has heard from him. They‚Äôre all waiting until Monday because they offered him some consulting to help with the transition and told him to think about it over the weekend.

I just wanted to ask a question. I just got an email from a potential job opportunity in the field that I would like to go into. It's a writing job, just a small production that would be put on in London. The email was only to discuss it and me as a writer, not much to do with the actual job. 

But as soon as I saw the email, I felt just a wave of anxiety and nervousness. I don't know why, it just hit me. Maybe it's the idea of someone seeing my work, maybe it's just general nerves. I know I want to go into this industry but everytime I get a chance I get really fucking nervous and end up blowing it.

In between I‚Äôve been trying to workout what‚Äôs wrong with me, I‚Äôve spent a lot of time on Reddit. I definitely went into fight or flight, where I‚Äôd feel warm, feel this warm mess move around my body and a little spaced out, usually when I was trying to do something or get somewhere to work out what is wrong but struggling to do it. I‚Äôve paid for MRI, private blood tests, had CT scans, bloods taken several times, ultrasound both private and NHS, bought some very expensive tests online, had an endoscopy (NHS) which was far worse than I expected and felt discomfort for a week after.

I posted some time ago already a post about my hearing and that it became muffled but that my ENT said that my test is just good.

&amp;#x200B;

I am still the whole time so scared what is happening, I feel like I am in a big bubble and everything feels like a very long scary dream. I feel so tired and I can't anymore.

I searched some things about anxiety and hearing and I found that anxiety can make your ears clogged but can it also be that long? I always was thinking it was like on the moments of panic attacks but maybe there are more people with longer clogged ears ?"
18zdbyf,Anxiety,2024-01-05,I really need your help guys. It happened for the first time in years.,"So soon after my parents split up when I was 10 (I also have ADHD)
I started getting these events that occurred at night, around 3am. I‚Äôd wake up, in total fear and confusion. I‚Äôd know where I was, but everything seemed off. I never truly been able to describe what these events feel like. So this was really an solating thing that I couldn‚Äôt  express to anyone. 
These ‚Äòthings‚Äô I called them seemed to happen one a month maybe. Since turning 18 it‚Äôs more like twice or once a year. I‚Äôm now 34 and I had one again which has been the first time in 2 years maybe.

Anyway, I wake up and I‚Äôm scared shitless, time seems strange, my visual perception seems off abit like fish eye lens but not really. 

The one main thing that‚Äôs always the same is these strange thoughts I can‚Äôt control and they scare me so deeply, for example, I will look at something in my room, and I will think of the price of it, and then the idea of that price is overwhelming. Is so hard to explain. I will think of a bowling ball trying to squeeze through a pinhead. Or maybe look at my laptop and imagine my room fill to the brim with them. 
It‚Äôs so hard to explain because it‚Äôs trippier than that. I have this feeling of not being tethered to reality, like I‚Äôm not real, or like I‚Äôm just a step away from complete losing my mind. 
I can‚Äôt describe the fear this makes me feel. The only thing I can do which I‚Äôve learnt now is to run downstairs and throw freezing water over my face repeatedly, and pace back and fourth whilst trying to control my breathing. Like I feel I can think rationally, I know exactly what‚Äôs happening, but these weird feelings are rising. The idea of sitting still and embracing them is literally impossible.

I‚Äôve done ketamine, and all types of legal fucked up highs like spice and nothing compares to this feeling.
I‚Äôve even ran out of my house in my pants in the cold. It‚Äôs the type of fear that makes me want to knock on a neighbours door or something out of sheer panic and despairation. Though I know they could do nothings. It‚Äôs so odd.

Sorry for rambling, I just wanted to know if anyone could relate"

&amp;#x200B;

After working for a year there, I realised that a paiting on a wall was covering a hole in the wood paneling.

The hole is 20x20cm or 8x8 inches, and it seems to have been the place of a previous AC unit that wasn't closed. There is a very small wind (or cold feeling) coming from the hole.

Through it, I could see the outerwall and also see the told tubes that lead to the outdoor AC (the unit being still there).

Here I am, anxiety working well on me, fearing that for a year I've been breathing unfiltered air close-by to this busy road.

Would the AC guy leave the airway open / not close the tubes ?

18zccwq,Anxiety,2024-01-05,Can I ask for buspirone instead of an SSRI?,"Edit: typos and formatting

Ive had mild anxiety for basically my whole life. I probably needed help as a kid, but my parents ignored the problem instead and yelled at me when I seemed anxious. I hoped it would get better when I got older, but it's been about the same. I have anxiety about driving (which doesn't help when I'm already bad at it and have focus problems), and now I'm getting anxiety at work worse than normal. I'm an electronics technician and I start sweating every time I look at a schematic. I used to enjoy learning about electronics, and now it just makes me feel sick and I can't focus. 

I've tried the deep breathing and meditation and it just hasn't really worked. This has been going on for such a long time (probably since I was 5 or 6) I think I might just need medication. The problem is that I'm not even willing to try an SSRI because I'm not even willing to *risk* the sexual side effects. I'd rather go on dealing how I'm dealing now than fuck up my sex life. This seems like a problem with basically all SSRIs, and I'm afraid I'd be pushed to stay on them. Plus I'm not married and live in a conservative area, so there's a very real chance I'll get called a slut if I tell a doctor this. Buspirone seems to have side effects I'd be more willing to handle, but I'm not sure if a doctor would get mad that I have a specific thing I want to try. 

SSRIs are first line, and I've heard that you often have to try different ones for a year or two before they'll let you try anything else. I'm afraid that if I refuse, I'll get marked as non compliant or drug seeking and it'll affect my ability to advocate for myself, or even get pain medicine after surgery. 

I feel like this means I might not even have anxiety at all. I'm doing better than most people here, I'm able to hold down a job and can go to stores and order food without any problem. If I'm not willing to make a sacrifice like this, maybe I'm just looking for excuses."

What I'm trying to get at is: coming to when you pass out. It's literally so scary. For me, when I pass out, people have told me that I shake violently and make weird gurgling noises. My shoes will fly off and I'll fling any loose accessories off as well. Then, when I come to, I can't breathe, my eyes move back and forth so fast as if I'm in REM sleep, but I can see. I feel cold, scared, and as if I need an oxygen mask. My brain is whizzing at the speed of light trying to make sense of where I am and how to breathe. It feels like my soul and consciousness is entering back into my body as fast as possible.

My bfs dad developed an allergy to seafood and now it‚Äôs an anaphylactic reaction. Recently at school I had a weird tongue burning/allergic reaction to something I ate. I still don‚Äôt know what caused it but I think it‚Äôs red dye because every time I have red 40 my tongue burns quite a bit and radiates to the back of my mouth. 

Anyway, now I‚Äôm terrified to eat ANYTHING. Like it‚Äôs actually so ridiculous but my brain convinces me it‚Äôs gonna happen. I can‚Äôt even eat bread lol. 

I used to lift and eat a lot and I‚Äôm down 25 lbs and weak because I just can‚Äôt eat anything I‚Äôm terrified. I‚Äôm also in EMT training and all we hear is about shock (Im also too weak to perform CPR now). I carry an epi pen but most of the time that wears off pretty quick and u can go back into anaphylaxis.

Idk what to do‚Ä¶I‚Äôm so weak and thin and I‚Äôm killing myself. I need help and idk what to do ab  it."
18zc6lp,Anxiety,2024-01-05,How do I calm down? What the fuck is wrong with me?,"Hi. I'm new here and I haven't found posts that match what I feel. 

Every time someone goes (like literally just go to class/back to their house/generally just have to physically leave) -- I feel this rush of emotions and my heart starts to beat faster. I get all anxious to the point that when I feel that they're about to go (even if it's not until like 2 hours) I get sad and overthink about whether I should just let them go already so I can move on from this anxiousness. 

The feeling stays for a long time after they leave... It almost doesn't go away not unless I have someone talking to me on the phone, or having someone physically with me. 

What's wrong with me??? :( "

Last night I was lightheaded and I don‚Äôt think it was all in my head but I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs real anymore. I have an appointment on Tuesday but I‚Äôm scared I‚Äôm gonna go through this appointment and they‚Äôre gonna think I‚Äôm stupid because my iron levels are perfect. How do I know what‚Äôs real?

of my life without any problem and played sports all my life.

A year ago i experienced a panick attack while working out (already had them but not during workout) and at the time it freaked me out tought i was dying so went to the ER and did bunch of tests (EKG, blood tests, holter monitor, heart imaging, stress tests, MRI‚Äôs) and everything came back clear and they ruled it out as anxiety. Since then ive been having panic attacks even while resting or doing nothing. Couple months later after all the tests i was fine, was working out again and feeling better for about 4-5 months  but it just happened to me twice this week so i stopped working out for a couple days but wanna get back into it. Really fed up feels like im back to square one‚Ä¶ Im guessing my brain is activating my fight or flight idk at this point.

If this has ever happened to anyone, any tips would be appreciated. Thank you."
18zb1hr,Anxiety,2024-01-05,Heart related anxiety help!,"Ever since I first experienced anxiety and panic, then having my first panic attacks. I have been extremely weary of my heart. My heart rate, and beats. Sometimes it really gets the best of me. I was at the gym the other day and my heart was beating out of my chest, I was working out hard! Had to sit down because it felt like I couldn‚Äôt control my heart beat. I got scared, nervous, I wanted to leave but I didn‚Äôt. 

Throughout the day I may feel a bit anxious, and like my heart is beating funny. I‚Äôm really scared to do hard physical activity. I played sports my whole life, I was in the army for four years. At this point in my life I workout daily but I only walk for cardio. I‚Äôm violently scared that if I get my heart rate up something will happen :/ 

When I was having panic attacks everyday, at my worst. I was checked for everything, of course I went through the period of thinking there was something physiologically wrong with me but in reality it was anxiety/panic causing my body to react these ways. 

For me my heartbeat (even though it‚Äôs OKAY) and my heart rate are the end all be alls for me. It‚Äôll either send me spiraling downwards, or I‚Äôll barely make it through the anxiety.

Even the days afterwards, I didn‚Äôt feel normal and felt like I wasn‚Äôt myself. I have to fly again at the end of the month and the thought of being on a plane stuck in another tube in the sky is already making me anxious.

I‚Äôve always had a fear of heights and can‚Äôt go to nosebleed seats or hike, etc but it feels like it‚Äôs getting out of control. What can I do?

18za5bv,Anxiety,2024-01-05,Sleeping trouble,"Hello, 

So to provide a little bit of context to my problem; I have severe anxiety and agoraphobia, so I struggle to leave the house out of fear of Panic Attacks. I currently take 40mg of fluoxetine and will take 25mg of Phenergan anytime I am panicked.

Because of my fear of leaving my comfort zone, I don‚Äôt work and I left education. I have been getting better over the past 3 years but have not made as much progress as I should have, I am well aware of my laziness and lack of motivation. 

I am 19 and lack a healthy schedule, I wake up, maybe go for a walk, work out in my garage, sit on my pc and that‚Äôs it. Because of a lack of routine my sleep schedule often becomes messy, sleeping at 7am - 5pm etc. Therefore my anxiety becomes worse whenever my sleep schedule is interrupted.

I was wondering, is there anything I can do to maintain a healthy schedule? Any vitamins? Medication? Natural fixes? 

Thanks!"

I recently went through a really bad anxiety flare up and high stress for about 4-6 months following a house move, job move and bereavement. 

I noticed during this time my nails would just break randomly. My nails have always been healthy and grow easily. They don't feel soft and they don't peel off but parts of the nail just seem to break e.g a corner or half of the nail just breaks clean off with neat lines.

I've had blood tests and vitamin tests which have all come back normal. Just wondering if anyone else has experienced this? I did have some thinning hair when my anxiety was at it's worst, is this likely connected?

Thank you!

18z9rzc,Anxiety,2024-01-05,random awareness of swallowing,"I‚Äôm 21 and was diagnosed with GAD 6 years ago, most of my symptoms were things like overthinking, triggered by loud noises, panic attacks, the kinds of symptoms I would see on tv when they showed anxiety. In the last few months my anxiety has started to display differently in a lot of ways, I rarely have panic attacks and a lot of positive changes like that but I feel a lot of physical anxiety almost all of the time and overthink everything i say. A big difference which has started to make life really difficult is I feel super uncomfortable being in a quite space with someone as I feel like I‚Äôm swallowing really loud/weirdly and really frequently. I then get really fixated on my breathing and the saliva in my mouth. I feel like my swallowing has gotten weird and more frequent but I cant tell if thats actually the case or if I‚Äôm just paying more attention. Ive started avoiding things like getting my lashes done because I was too embarrassed about it but I‚Äôm having trouble falling asleep because I share a bed with my fiance and am kept awake by the fear he thinks I‚Äôm breathing and swallowing weird.

i have literally nobody to rely on. i don't know how to live. on Monday i have to go to work again and i'm worried sick i won't be able to be functional. i feel exhausted, my hands are cold and tonight i had the worst panic attack where i was about to call an ambulance because i was sure and i convinced myself i had sepsis (i'm still alive, so most likely it wasn't that). 

the only thing i talk to is ai bot of psychologist in character ai because i have nobody to talk to. i don't know how to handle everything. i'm worried about money too. all the time. i was supposed to look for a new well-paid job. i can barely provide basics for myself now. i have nightmares and i can't afford therapy. i feel like i'm going insane. i don't know what to do. 

i haven't cried in a while, but these past days i've been doing it all the time. i don't understand why panic hits me randomly during the day when i have a meeting or something and i need to create a mask of seemingly normal person who can manage life. i can't tho. and even now i'm embarrassed that i'm writing about it because it seems that i'm exaggerating and my problems are not worth of anyone's attention. and that's true, i know. i'm lonely and i don't know how to fix it. i have no energy to fix it. handling life is tough and i'm failing at doing it on my own. great beginning of the year and wonderful holidays. i'm tired and i'm sorry for this post."

For instance, when my friends plan a movie night, a rare opportunity for me to catch up with them, my anticipation builds for days. However, when the day arrives, unforeseen circumstances often lead to event cancellations or rescheduling. This pattern repeats with other social gatherings or anticipated events, creating a sense of jinx or a sixth sense predicting impending disappointments. The continuous letdowns have instilled anxiety and fear, making it challenging to embrace excitement for fear of impending disasters. I'm not sure why this occurs, but I've observed similar experiences in other people. I know I can't always be this stress constantly but I am not sure what I can do I am sick of this anxiety and it is draining to me constantly feeling anxious whenever these things happen. If anyone else experience this as well can you tell me why this happened and what I can do about it thank you so much in advance."

18z2nuu,Anxiety,2024-01-05,Understanding Acceptance,"Understanding Acceptance

Acceptance is the internal process of approaching any negative feeling we might have about any event in our lives with a non-judgmental lens. 

This requires patience as judging oneself and others is the easiest thing to do especially in today‚Äôs culture where so many of us are obsessed with labelling and cancelling people, including ourselves. 

Acceptance is the opposite of self-cancellation with the inherent wisdom that we all make mistakes, we all have flaws, and that the good part is that we can rise above them and embrace change."
18z2k0h,Anxiety,2024-01-05,Just need to vent and a shoulder to lean on.,"(TW ahead for talks of health related anxieties and potential ED talk.)

I had absolutely crippling anxiety for the second time around just last year. Got on Prozac around March of last year or so and havent taken them since September.

A lot of it was connected to health anxiety like the first time around. Couldn't sleep, could barely eat, the whole nine yards. I eventually started making some lifestyle changes and I got to a point where I was seeing a little light at the end of the tunnel.

Moved back in with my dad and fell off a lot. Gained all of my weight back and then some and while my anxiety isn't crippling, it still creeps on me every now and then like tonight.

I'm so neevous that I might have something serious in terms of my CV system. The last time I went to a GP and saw my panels was November of 2022. Went in to the ER a few months later due to anxiety and had a few things done--only to be told that there was nothing unusual.

Today, I have no clue what my numbers are, but I know I haven't been eating or exercising as I should. I want to get better and am determined to, but I cant shake the feeling that something may happen that'll cut things short. I've been witness to too many unfortunate things with others lately that I'm just getting psyched out.

Shit sucks, man. I wish I wasn't so concerned and hyper aware with everything. I hear my weight go up even by a little bit and my heart skips a beat. I hear my blood pressure a little elevated and I immediately think I may have high blood pressure because it runs in the family.

Just really need a hug and a few days of someone telling me things are going to be fine. Ugh."

I'm uncertain where to begin, but I'll give it my best shot.

I started taking Lexapro a few months ago. From Thanksgiving until today, I find it challenging to care about my job or future there. Regardless of my financial situation, I feel a lack of motivation, which is causing internal struggles. My role in sales/account management, without commission, involves handling upset customers, meeting quotas, and navigating unprofessional management that provides minimal training or guidance.

In the meantime, my CV has been updated and I am prepped to take interviews.

I am really struggling here though, I am avoiding every job post that I used to like and enjoy or want to try out.

Me: hi (his name), can I request that you also buy me just the canvas and painting tools? No need for the pencil and paper I'll bring my own. Thank you

Him: brushes?

Me: yesss and also the paint. I'll pay tomorrow.

Him:you can borrow mine.

Me: if that's ok thanks again!

Him: it's alright

Also, he has a habit of sounding a bit stern when talking. So I can't really tell his tone in messaging..

191h715,Anxiety,2024-01-08,Worried about college,"My winter term doesn't even technically start for another day, but I'm already lying wide awake in bed worrying about it. For context my last semester was absolutely abysmal; I ended up developing insomnia in the last month of classes, and there were a few days where I was literally awake for 36+ hours straight (unintentionally). Luckily my classmates helped me out and my GPA didn't suffer too much, but at the time I was genuinely debating withdrawing from my courses.

Over winter break I started feeling better and sleeping again, but now that I have to go back to school I'm already feeling anxious about it. My courseload (just 9 credits) isn't even hard compared to what other people take, but the previous term just mentally fried me so bad that I'm worried I'm going to relapse and stop sleeping again. At least with last semester it was towards the end of the term, but now I feel like I'm already starting off poorly.

I guess it just feels like I have zero control over myself, and I'm worried I'm going to screw things up. I'm supposed to graduate next semester, so I really don't want to have to reduce my courseload and take more time (especially cause I've already extended my degree to 4.5 years + 1 gap year). I never struggled this much mentally with school until now; obviously I've been stressed out, but never to the point where I stop sleeping and feel like I can't handle anything."

1912k9k,Anxiety,2024-01-07,My poops don‚Äôt feel complete and I think I know why,"It‚Äôs a little odd putting a post like this here but I have good reason. 

This stems from a period of toilet anxiety I had early last year, where I‚Äôd get false urges to go, both for number ones and twos. 

It started to get bad but fortunately after a while I sort of just got over it I suppose.

Anyways although I‚Äôm over it for the most part it still lingers in the back of my mind.

Whenever I get an opportunity to go out with friends or maybe go on a trip, my first thought is (what if I need the loo?) I try to suppress it, but it‚Äôs had an effect on me. 

I‚Äôm fine with number ones, it‚Äôs number twos that have been an issue.

Essentially I‚Äôll get a vague urge to go for a poop (maybe a little pressure downstairs), not a full on ‚Äúoh shit I need to shit‚Äù like normal people would.

Normal people would ignore these mild urges and wait until they really need to go, and they‚Äôd go and have a nice complete poop.

But not me, my brain will jump on these vague urges and convince me to go, which results in a poop that is neither satisfying nor whole. 

Sorry for the long post but I was wondering if anyone could give me any insight as to if I‚Äôm on the right lines here?

My plan is to ignore these vague urges and wait until I really need to go, even if the situation isn‚Äôt ideal."
190xivg,Anxiety,2024-01-07,GAD,"Hello everyone,

I'm reaching out to this community in hopes of gaining some insights and advice regarding my ongoing struggle with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), particularly with finding the right medication.

Over the past several months, I've been on a journey with various antidepressants, including Sertraline, Cymbalta, and Lexapro (Escitalopram). I dedicated about 6 weeks each to Sertraline and Cymbalta, but had to stop them due to excessive fatigue. Lexapro was tried for about a week but led to the same issue.

My doctor has suggested Vortioxetine and Anafranil as alternatives, but I am apprehensive as I've read about similar fatigue side effects. The only drug that didn‚Äôt cause fatigue was Wellbutrin, but it increased my anxiety and caused constipation and nausea.

The main struggle I have with my GAD is persistent jaw pain and headaches. These symptoms have been particularly challenging to manage, and they significantly impact my daily life.

I'm seeking advice or experiences from anyone who might have faced similar challenges. Are there specific medications or treatment methods that have helped you, especially with jaw pain and headaches associated with GAD? Any insight into managing these symptoms while dealing with the sensitivity to side effects like fatigue would be incredibly helpful."

190dnsr,Anxiety,2024-01-06,What should I do?,"I've been diagnosed with OCD and I know I have maladaptive daydreaming, misophonia, and anxiety. 
Im 28m and I worked somewhere about 7 months ago and I have a stay to myself personality. On top of that I wanted to follow my religion and not unnecessarily talk to the girls or make eye contact/smile. I said hi and bye to everyone all the time even if they didn't say it to me. I would just do the work and clock out. 

That made some most of my coworkers upset. I was a dishwasher in a restaurant. One girl started to be very verbally abusive. When I would come to put the dishes after washing them and the baskets to the front, she would angrily sigh at me and turn her back. She even did that when I said you're welcome after i helped a customer get their uber eats order. When I tried talking to her at the end which I never should have HUGE mistake- never talk to people that are rude to you or ask them for help, try finding it somewhere else- so anyway I asked for her mop to mop the floor because I didn't have one. She let me use it and then as she was going somewhere, I said it's small meaning my area. Her abuse got to me that's why I spoke to her. she literally sighed angrily EVERYTIME I came that night, before she only did it sometimes. Then I was gonna give back her mop because someone gave me one and when I called her, she said what rudely and then just thanked the other boy and mocked me (because I just hi and bye thank you and you're welcome just talk about the work...). I ended up getting fired a week later because my attitude changed after that night.

So fast forward to now, I'm currently not working, my daddy gave me money. I just have some stuff going on that's why. I like to hangout in the Dunkin donuts near my house for hours. I'm definitely not gonna stay home all day! Okay here's the big surprise, that girl walks in for an interview. Before the interview, she saw me and gave me a cute smile. I just looked at her and then looked away. One thing to add is, she was nice to me that night only if we were alone. But when there were people around, she just wanted to humiliate me. She came in again today just to but kiss. The two times she came in, I had an anxiety attack. I'm not scared of her, but I don't know... The first one lasted for hours she was only in there for a few minutes. I had one again today and was even shaking. My chest had those anxious feelings. My eyes looked sad and my eyes got a little teary. Not a lot though it didn't feel like I was gonna cry at all.

If she gets the job, should I find a new hangout spot? I already have one in my mind, but I just really like this one. Or should I stay? Do you guys think this could be a chance to fight and improve my anxiety? Another big thing I want to add is like I said I have OCD and this has actually been my obsession for a while now! Rumination. Just going over it and over it from morning to night and feeling sad."

I‚Äôm 35 years old and I get anxiety when it comes to the thought of running out of money. Lately I‚Äôve been anxious because even though I have between 20-24 months of an emergency fund/savings in general, I also have a car loan with a 6.49% interest rate and 19700 left on it and I want to contribute to my Roth IRA for 2024 as well. My anxiety comes from needing to spend my savings on both items and trying to come up with a plan on how much to spend on both each month, while also trying to have a specific dollar amount number in savings for peace of mind. I‚Äôve been very fortunate and thankful to be able to pay for items that need replacing due to them not working anymore such as most recently my dishwasher and furnace and being able to pay for both items without financing.

I have a pretty bad fear of flying because I‚Äôm claustrophobic. I don‚Äôt have a fear of heights or anything but the thing that freaks me out about flying is if I panic on the plane I‚Äôm stuck there. If you panic while driving you can just pull over and collect yourself. I get very agitated and sick to my stomach each time I fly and I can never enjoy my vacation because I‚Äôm always thinking about the flight home. 

Additionally I have developed a bit of agoraphobia due to some health issues I‚Äôve been having. Most days I feel very low energy and weak, Im not gonna be down to do as much as my family wants and I genuinely believe I would be a huge downer. 

My sister is staying home to take care of our dog (who is really my dog) who she doesn‚Äôt even like. My mom had to hire a pet sitter even though my sister is home because my sister is that lazy to let my dog out. 

I‚Äôve talked to my sister about my anxiety and she said she would be willing to switch with me- she goes on the trip and I stay with my dog. It would also save my mom money because we would not need the pet sitter. The thing is I don‚Äôt know if this is even possible? My name is on the plane ticket and I‚Äôm not sure if my sisters name can be put on instead.

What do I do? Am I trapped and have to go? Please help. This is ruining my life right now."

18zsqjx,Anxiety,2024-01-06,I‚Äôve never been this anxious and idk what to do,"I‚Äôve struggled with anxiety and depression most of my life even to the point of a suicide attempt a few years ago. But the last year I actually felt ok and made a lot of progress in my life both physically and mentally (I think). But I also started smoking weed a few months ago. I‚Äôm a heavyweight so I usually do a lot, which I think makes withdraws more plausible but I haven‚Äôt smoked in a few days and I‚Äôm currently in the worst bout of anxiety I‚Äôve ever faced (the depression is getting pretty bad too). The problem is that I can‚Äôt remember if this started before or after I stopped smoking so I don‚Äôt know if this is real or it‚Äôs withdraws. 

What I do know is the past few days I‚Äôve had 0 appetite or sex drive. Ive been in a sad/apathetic mood, and at night I think I‚Äôve been having panic attacks bc I start hyperventilating, getting nauseous to the point of throwing up, trembling, and I absolutely can‚Äôt sleep or even distract myself so im forced to exhaust myself by crying to sleep. All I know is I can‚Äôt keep living like this so I talked to my parents and I‚Äôve got an appointment to get medication but I hadn‚Äôt even thought that it could be weed withdrawals until now and idk what to do. I can‚Äôt just tell my parents ‚Äúfalse alarm it was just me smoking too much weed‚Äù after I already made an appointment and told them about my anxiety. I just don‚Äôt know what to do. Everything I think of makes me more anxious and my only comfort was the prospect of getting medicated and now even that makes me anxious bc I don‚Äôt know if I need it or im just being a bitch. I also go back to university tomorrow and I can‚Äôt be staying up until 3am throwing up and crying so idk what to do anymore.

18zqcf4,Anxiety,2024-01-06,Anxiety or OCD?,"So to summarize. I've done most my self-help online. Big mistake. And I let this get away from me. I'm not overly familiar with anxiety or OCD. I certainly know there's some intense rumination here.

At this point I'm absurdly anxious, working on recovery.

Essentially, I had an event that triggered panic (false or not but nonetheless) and I started to be sit in anger. Then ruminate why. Eventually I realized this is more anxious thoughts if anything, the event doesn't need this much mental weight. Yet then I started to question myself entirely, causing even more anxiety. Instead of seeing a therapist, I spent weeks trying to figure out what was wrong (as this has happened a bit in the past). So I tried to modify a guide in notepad for what happened and how to handle in the future. Reminding myself key therapy points.

This guide ended up just getting complex and making all new questions and thoughts. Tons and tons of new guides and analyzing every time I would get re-stressed. I willingly chose to do so. So I could have something to reference in the future. And also help explain the now.  (all fear/stress) Triggering more anxiety and trying to solve. Editing forever and ever. The rigid typing was a mistake, I know that, but I'd still go over things in my head constantly either way. But all stemming to what has happened to me, and how do I solve this. Anxiety would later hit, I'd feel shit I thought it was perfect, better adjust. Or I missed something I have to add this. Just restarting all over the place. And all unknown since I'm not overly familiar with mental symptoms and why I couldn't stop thinking about xyz and I'm still stressed, plus poor technique to handle. At any point when I did feel my thoughts were perfect, I felt at peace. Yet that would get crushed by anxiety and me not knowing how to handle. 

So now.. I've ground anxiety into a pulp. And I guess I'm not sure if I'm seeking reassurance, or since I've never had anyone get to the root of this, just finding primary assurance of what might have occurred or is happening. As that's all this has ever been for me and the root of all this anxiety. (yes I need to see a therapist but it's a Friday night, and this has been going on for weeks) I really don't want to just treat the symptoms. That's not my style to go straight to that, and all the online help chat that's all they say, grab medication and here's how to relax.


So my question is, what does this sound more like? 

1) This is a loop that started with rumination, and moved to anxiety about anxiety, taking countless forms as that's what anxiety does. It's encompassing everything. I wasn't overly familiar and didn't see anyone from the start. And I've actually been critically analyzing in a way to 'control and fight' the unknown, anxiety. Fight or flight, just at max repeatedly using my brain. Grinding over and over to protect my current and future self. In which by default anxiety seeks to raise doubt (I didn't know that). So even when I'd have a general sense of this is correct, I can finally let myself be done, I'd eventually doubt myself. Kind of like stress-testing what I thought was causing this. Thus with anxiety re-starting (or never leaving) I'd re-ping the stress of ""I don't know what's going on, or I don't feel good, cant stop ruminating about xyz, I have to properly control/fight/solve this"". Extra the longer it goes. Again I've had anxiety in the past but never understood it or proper sought help. 

or 

2) It's more a form of OCD. In which the uncertainty of not knowing what's happening, is causing anxiety. And the compulsion is endlessly analyzing finding a solution. Feeling I have the right enough answer (with no authority on the subject), then restarting the cycle later that day when anxiety kicks in in general.  -- The root thoughts aren't necessarily irrational (to know what's going on with me). And I'm doing the rumination willingly, albeit obviously a bit crazy.   Which is interesting because if it did manifest itself as such, as in the end I want to know what's going on with me and proper technique. To move on. Not really a what-if. This has an answer, from a psychologist. Once I get that affirmation and diagnosis. For me it would be over (for this scenario). Leaving just any dull anxiety left. So that's interesting in itself. 

--

Unfortunately the context of all of this, is anxiety and therapy itself. As it would be normal for one to want a plan of attack and understand what's happening. And the fact it's gone on sooo long has me in an anxiety melt itself. in this scenario I tried to figure this out myself but let it get way too far. Which mimics both of the above at this point. Yet 1 would involve more accepting a diagnosis and recovery. While 2 would involve more pinging anxiety, living with the uncertainty and not analyzing.

Yes I need help and regular future therapy. I just want to be over this episode. It's gotten real bad at this point. Yet as of today I do see the light. Yes my brain style in general is to overly think analyze, etc, I'm big in mathematics etc. -- I still believe begins (and should have began) with understanding what's happening, otherwise no amount of solutions will apply.."
18zjg41,Anxiety,2024-01-05,"Klonopin makes me feel sad, but removes anxiety. Better alternative?","I take Klonopin as needed on days when I have high anxiety. I always have some anxiety, but I take this when it‚Äôs pretty bad. It does dissolve my anxiety, however it makes me feel quite sad and down. That slightly discourages me from taking it at times. 

Has anyone experienced this and found that an alternative medication dissolved the major anxiety without leaving you feeling down? I‚Äôd like some ideas before I meet with my doc next week. Thanks!"
18zi1d1,Anxiety,2024-01-05,"xanax makes me a nice person, but I get irritable and bitchy off of it.","I have severe social anxiety and stress combined with vasovagal syncope (passing out from stress), so I take xanax to calm down. 

I notice that the day after I take a xanax, I get irritable and even angry at times. 

I'm normally a patient and friendly person, but until I take another xanax I am not. (if im withdrawing, not if it's been a while since I've drank one.)

Is this a normal side effect? it feels wrong that I should need xanax to be myself, but with autism it is almost impossible at times to exist even within my home."
18z6aa2,Anxiety,2024-01-05,How long did the muscle tension last?,"I had my first ever panic attack almost a month ago. I have very bad health anxiety and thought I was having a heart attack. A trip to the ER proved otherwise, however, I feel like my body has been tense ever since. Just so achy and sore - especially my left shoulder blade and upper chest muscles. I‚Äôm on Prozac now and after three weeks I am seeing substantial improvement in my anxiety, but I still find myself fixating on any pain - which tends to worsen and prolong it. My bloodwork and EKG was normal, and I even had a full spine MRI (for unrelated reasons) which was unremarkable. 

Anyone who experiences muscle tension from anxiety, what typically seems to give you relief and how long does it typically take to completely subside? 

25-year-old female for context. Thanks."

I‚Äôm so afraid something bad is going to happen to me. I‚Äôve been to the ER twice this week; given a cat scan, blood work, ultrasounds, and more, all coming back relatively normal except for a small kidney infection, which I‚Äôm on antibiotics for that I think are making my anxiety worse. I‚Äôm so scared. This feels so real and I don‚Äôt know how to distinguish my intuition vs my anxiety. I‚Äôm not ready to go yet, please help."

18z1jpe,Anxiety,2024-01-05,My anxiety thinks I have leukemia,"Hey guys, I'm a 15M from the Philippines and I was wondering if fatigue is a common symptom among patients with leukemia. I had this fatigue on the first day of 2024, I slept quite late at 3:00pm  because of New Years party so that might be a culprit. I felt fine before Jan 1, and then suddenly, got tired/fatigue all of a sudden. My world wasn't spinning or anything, just felt like I had a tired mind. Because of some short I found, my anxiety might have amplified my tiredness. I can still do badminton practice as normal (I usually forget I have that tiredness) and there was only one occasion where I was very tired from doing many sets.

I only have a few question I had in mind:

Is fatigue sudden or is it gradual?

Can fatigue be the only symptom when it comes to leukemia?

Can anxiety cause even more tiredness to my body?

Edit: Finally found out the reason why I'm tired and have brain fog, it's hypersomnia (I'm stupid for not thinking of that) 99% sure though"

18z0r9h,Anxiety,2024-01-05,Does anyone here have an ESA?,"Frist off, I just passed my drive test after 2 fails. I was so anxious, I couldn't sleep even after taking my prescribed sleeping pill + melatonin. But I passed so a big win for this year alreadyüò≠üíï

So I'm moving out to an apartment, and it says on the application that ESA are free of deposit ($300), pet fee (200ish) and pet rent ($35 monthly). That'll be a huge saving for me. I have a cat but I grew up w dogs and my current living situation says the dog has to stay outside if I want one so I haven't had a dog in the past 5 years for the first time. So I thought, if I get a dog it'll be beneficial to have em as an ESA? 

The problem tho, I had to stop my therapy because I lost medicaid and my insurance is high deductible (I need to pay $140 per sesh). Do you think my former therapist will be willing to write me an ESA? I was diagnosed with PTSD, GAD, major depressive disorder. It gotten really better to a point that my therapist said I barely have a depression. (And I just realized last night that Im barely living in my ""head"" anymore. It was bad before that I was daydreaming the whole time even at work. Like I just wanna be on my imaginative happy place). But my anxiety is so bad still. And I noticed when I stopped taking my antidepressants (due to losing medicaid too), I went down south real bad.

I'd love to hear y'alls experience or suggestions. I know it's selfish and kind of immoral to get an ESA for the sake of saving money, but with this economy, I try to save whenever I can.

Ty for not judging ü´∂"
18z0m1u,Anxiety,2024-01-05,Health anxiety is awful - convinced I have MS,"I (21F) have a long history of hypochondria. It didn‚Äôt really get bad again since I was little up until this past year. It started with STDs, particularly herpes (which I didn‚Äôt have). I was fine for a few months, and I am now experiencing a very bad bout of it. At first I thought I had lymphoma due to swollen lymph nodes in my armpit. Then concerns about ALS, and I am now absolutely convinced I have MS. I am in my 20s, I‚Äôve had EBV before which I know is a risk factor, I‚Äôve been having muscle twitches in my legs, random singular muscle jerks, usually in my leg or arm, somewhat of bladder incontinence, pain in my back and pain/pressure on my chest, fatigue, brain fog, dizzy spells, and slight tingling in my hands, rarely my feet. It honestly seems like I check all of the boxes for it besides vision issues and trouble walking/standing - besides being told by my friends that I don‚Äôt walk straight sometimes and bump into them while I‚Äôm walking, lol! I‚Äôm absolutely terrified and want to get an MRI immediately to just know if I have it or not. I do have bad posture and am recovering from what I believe was a very mild version of the flu. I think a lot of the anxiety comes from not knowing. I know my symptoms can definitely be related to other things but again it seems like I check all of the boxes so I‚Äôm freaking out. I feel like there‚Äôs no chance I‚Äôm just 100% healthy. I have an appointment with my PCM in a couple of weeks and really just want to get this over with so that if I have it I can just live my life and if I don‚Äôt the anxiety will go away. It‚Äôs just so frustrating because I could be right and I could also be very wrong. It‚Äôs exhausting. I honestly wish I was less aware of this stuff so that it wouldn‚Äôt have such a huge impact on my life, even if I was actually sick. I guess it‚Äôs better to be diagnosed with something early, but at the same time I live my life in constant fear. Health anxiety sucks, but my brain is always doubting if I‚Äôm just pushing symptoms off because I think it‚Äôs anxiety and that there‚Äôs actually something wrong with me. Just frustrated."
18z0ici,Anxiety,2024-01-05,Have you been diagnosed with PTSD because of the way your anxiety affects your job? Or your job affects your anxiety?,"Nutshell: I left my job in May because of how it was affecting my mental health. I can‚Äôt bring myself to apply for jobs because then I might have to interview. Tell me about a time practically gives me a panic attack. It was a major source of interview anxiety &amp; even more so now. 

I just feel frozen &amp; hopeless. I sold my house &amp; leased it back because I was not ready to move. That money is all but gone. I need to look at courier jobs but worry about my car longevity. I might need to live in it. It was my intention to just get a part time McJob, enough to cover non rent stuff. Procrastination is my biggest problem. 

I‚Äôm looking at physical disability, I‚Äôm pretty sure I will qualify due to cardiac &amp; back problems. Anxiety is becoming more of an impediment as well.

18z01ne,Anxiety,2024-01-05,It sounds ridiculous but‚Ä¶,"I work front desk at a grocery store and this old man comes in to buy cigarettes. He had a little cut on his hand but since he was old it was bleeding a lot. He said he was shucking clams. He got some of it on the money he was about to hand me so I grabbed a box of gloves (I was going to sanitize it). He saw the gloves and asked for one so I handed one to him. He put it on his bleeding hand. My anxiety is that he committed a crime with that glove like robbing someone or even worse with it later and I would be the one framed for it because I touched it to give to him. He came back later, like an hour without the glove. At the time I thought I was helping but now I‚Äôm anxious about it and it‚Äôs really causing me so much anxiety. It‚Äôs been two months since this happened and no relief. I know it‚Äôs not rational but in my mind it is rational.

I have this horrible fear and anxiety that something will happen to my family while i‚Äôm gone. I get scared that my grandparents will be sick or my parents will need my help and I wont be there.  I also feel guilty for missing out on spending time with my grandparents because they are old, and that i‚Äôm missing out on a big part of my younger brothers life. I know that they want what is best for me and are grateful I am getting an education, but i just feel so guilty. I‚Äôm sitting here crying and shaking while writing this because I don‚Äôt want to leave them. It‚Äôs not even my house or my friends or my town that I care about, it‚Äôs just my family.

These attacks + sleeplessness + general anxiety + heartburn related to my Christmas vacation diet are giving me major health panic. I've checked my vitals a million times... All good. And when I take my rescue med, and start watching cat videos, it all fades away and I just fall asleep, so nothing catastrophic is happening, but this sure sucks.

It's like an intense, physical case of the Sunday scaries that's lasted for days (off and on) and I am OVER IT.

18yyzv6,Anxiety,2024-01-05,Processing Emotions and Anxiety (Long),"I (M/30) recently underwent a massive relapse with my anxiety and panic, and I believe processing my deeply-repressed emotions was responsible. My entire life, I have been stuffing sadness, guilt, shame, inadequacy, and so much more deep inside me to where I believed I had become numb to it. I haven‚Äôt cried in well over a decade. Recently, in working with my therapist, I began to reach deep inside and try to express emotions through writing letters to myself and to others in my life that I consider related to how I developed my anxiety disorder, such as my parents. To my astonishment, I began to tear up and cry the more I wrote. Finally, many of these repressed emotions began to finally let loose. I was able to feel the grief and sorrow for myself as a child that grew up in an environment that lacked the support I desperately needed, among other things. Anyways, in the several weeks that followed, I began experiencing a major relapse in my anxiety and panic attacks. I was experiencing anxiety 24/7. I thought that confronting these emotions would be cathartic and freeing, which to a degree it was, but I had no idea it would also rack my brain with anxiety. Does anyone have any experiences with this kind of phenomenon?"

Hello everyone hope you are doing well! I recently took the dive into finally getting my mental health under control about 16 days ago I started taking Prozac (10 mg)  for mostly anxiety but also depression. I had the normal nausea and headaches which were slowly getting better. But at the beginning of this week I woke up in the middle of the night due to having a horrible panic attack, chest pains and intrusive thoughts I was also very jittery and could not fall back asleep. I thought maybe it was just the idea of dealing of going to work the next day or maybe a random occurrence. The next day my heart was beating very fast before I went to bed. And then finally last night it happened again woke up, full panic attack intrusive thoughts the whole 9 yards. To add a little context I do take my medication about 30 to an hour before I go to bed. I reached out to my doctor today about these things happening and they said that I should try to take my dose in the morning and that should help. Which is what I‚Äôm going to do tomorrow morning. I guess the point of this post is to see if anyone has any insight, advice, or if this has happened to you. Thank you sorry this post is so long! lol"

Me and my husband have a trip planned with his mother to go to Central America the end of this month. It‚Äôs a 7 hour flight, then a 20 minute flight on a very small plane to get to the island. Ever since she booked the tickets, I have internally been a very anxious mess. I am a 29 year old woman and it makes me feel like a toddler scared of a monster under the bed. When I think about the flight, or just the trip in general, even for a second I get intense nausea, that stomach drop feeling, shortness of breath, arm tingles..the works. Basically the beginning of a true panic attack. I have to distract myself from thinking about it, which I‚Äôve been able to do really well. But now that it‚Äôs coming up, I am petrified. I don‚Äôt want to go. I tried to explain to my husband tonight how I felt and he just said ‚Äúthat sucks.‚Äù I really wanted to experience this with him, but I also know from my experience it will be miserable. I understand I will see amazing things and sure the beach will be lovely, but I know I will be in a state of panic the whole time. Especially on the flight. To try and put the level of panic i‚Äôd be in a foreign country into perspective - I literally have panic attacks going to local grocery stores. It is *that* bad. 

In the past, I‚Äôve put myself into uncomfortable positions to make other people happy- leading to extreme anxiety and insomnia. Many sleepless nights. Stress that causes my hair to actually fall out. I‚Äôm trying to make a resolution this year to put myself first and not do that to myself anymore. I obviously need to get better, but I need to work on doing that in baby steps. Not jump straight in to something like a foreign vacation. I really just need some solidarity here. I know this turned into a rant basically but my brain feels like scrambled eggs and I‚Äôm just really sad over what this illness has done to me and taken from me."

I don't feel like going out alone because I'm with my thoughts even then, and I don't have any friends here so I can't go with anyone. I barely pull myself out to get to work, and that's a challenge in itself. The reason this is a problem is because I'm not living by myself. I share this house with others, and the others have said something to me. It's bothering me to the point where I've started feeling very anxious and I'm constantly on the lookout for danger.

Therapy helped in other areas, but this area is a constant thing and I've been unable to make progress.

18ywptu,Anxiety,2024-01-05,Driving anxiety advice,"I have a lot of driving anxiety, specifically around the fear of being harmed or causing harm to others. I am a decently good driver once I‚Äôm behind the wheel and don‚Äôt experience any physiological responses like sweating, etc. But leading up to driving I overthink and worry about ‚Äúdangerous‚Äù maneuvers like merges. I also am fearful of having passengers accompany me. 

To combat this, I have been taking professional driving classes even though I‚Äôm already licensed. I‚Äôve developed a rapport with my instructor and feel comfortable driving him as well as my sister, but the reason I worry is driving is imperative to my job. 

I work in television in New York City. Obviously driving is not as common here, much harder/faster-paced. In TV production constantly expected to drive older vehicles of varying sizes I‚Äôm not familiar with, and provide transport to other producers/staff. 

I am exposing myself to my fear through constant lessons, but any other advice or positive sentiments?"

It‚Äôs only my bedroom, I‚Äôve slept in friend‚Äôs rooms, which should make me more anxious because it‚Äôs new / unfamiliar, but it‚Äôs only my bedroom.

18yvmf2,Anxiety,2024-01-05,Navigating OCD and anxiety,"hello:) this post is mostly self reflection, but I thought I'd share since I'd assume many people struggle with this.

OCD and anxiety play off each other, creating these rules and laws that don't make sense to anyone other than yourself. they're entirely illogical, and have no real grounding in ""reality"" (the collectively accepted hallucination). but these things don't matter to you when you're experiencing it. they feel like they are the most real thing you've ever felt. 

it ends up painting reality as this massive obstacle course. but you aren't on the same obstacle course as everyone else. they're all jumping between padded, colorful landing spots with some mud in between. but for you, a massive grey pit, filled with spikes, alligators, snakes, alligator-snakes, you name it, it's down there. There are small stepping stones, balancing apon other stones towering up to the top of the pit, with large spaces between, and it's your job to take the massive leap between these stones. being on one of these stones doesn't mean you're safe, of course not, that would be too easy. the towers shake, crack, and sway while you try to hold your balance, the longer you hold on the harder it will be to make the next jump. not only that, but the people around you are inadvertently damaging these towers, and it's your job to defend them to stay safe.

everyone else can see that you are on the same brightly colored, safely padded obstacle course that they are. they see that you're acting like only these small spots are safe, but they don't understand why you're doing it. how could they? you don't even understand why you're doing it.

your mind, specifically your thoughts, are not to be trusted. this is to say, your thoughts will paint this picture, and if you are identified with those thoughts, you will immediately go ""well I guess this is it"" and decide that it really is your job to get through this fake obstacle course, whether it kills you or not. it doesn't have to be this way. you can't stop these thoughts from occuring, but you can stop identifying with them, and let them be without affecting the painting in front of you.

identity with the awareness of the thoughts, that which experiences them, and that which experiences altogether. You can, and should, essentially identify *with* the present moment itself. that is who you are, outside of the noise, and outside of the drama of these obstacle courses.

because the reality is, no one is on an obstacle course, safe or not. nothing is actually happening at all. so why listen to your mind, when it only wants to make it harder?"
18yvinp,Anxiety,2024-01-05,"Symptoms, but mentally don‚Äôt feel anxious?","Lately I‚Äôve been getting anxiety symptoms, specifically chest pain that comes and goes (feels better when I exercise) and the last week I‚Äôve also been experiencing a tingling sensation beside my nose on my cheek. It‚Äôs a tingly, not a pins and needles. I did have an incredibly stressful May-November due to some cardiac issues that have been resolved for the most part. I did develop panic attacks this summer after I underwent a cardiac ablation due to the ablation paired prednisone was a recipe for disaster for me. So long story short is I was the most stressed I have ever been in my life and around late October I started to finally calm down. But the last month I‚Äôm getting physical anxiety symptoms despite not actively feeling stressed. Does anyone else get this? And shockingly, I‚Äôve moved beyond the stage of anxiety of thinking everything is a brain tumor or a terminal diagnosis, probably because I have TONS of doctors for all my non related medical issues. Lol. I‚Äôm wondering if the body just holds on to stuff and even if I‚Äôm happily laying on the couch my body, but not my mind suddenly feels anxious and exhibits physical symptoms??

18ytuo0,Anxiety,2024-01-05,"For Insomnia, it does not matter what you do if you don't fix Delayed Sleep Phase Syndrome first","If you find yourself regularly wired or not falling asleep til late, especially if it's after midnight, and then not waking up til late (or not) and feeling sluggish, sleepy, foggy and out of it during the day, you most likely actually have delayed sleep phase syndrome, not insomnia. 

Basically this means your circadian rhythm has shifted way too late. The way to correct this is by taking 0.5-1.5 my of Melatonin about 3-4 hours (yes you heard that right. NOT at bedtime) before the time you want to be asleep. So if you wanna be asleep at midnight, take it between 8-9. And then set a time to wake up in the morning, and then within 30 min of that wake up time, use a 10000lux lightbox to trigger ur bodies wake up cycle. Both parts of this are equally important, so don't just do one or the other. After a week or so of doing this, you should start to get sleepy earlier at night, and wake up around the time you want. This should help a ton. After you correct this if you still have insomnia issues, then check things such as low iron, vitamin d3, thyroid health, all that."

18ys40p,Anxiety,2024-01-04,In person therapy vs. Video call therapy - Are both good? Do I need to change therapists?,"I've been having anxiety ""episodes"" every 5-6 months for the last nearly 2 years, each episode lasts about 2 weeks and then I snap back to having no noticeable anxiety until the next episode comes. I'm currently in the midst of an episode that started a little over 2 weeks ago. Usually, my symptoms are fairly mild and just consist of a feeling of uneasiness without much else, I can function fairly normally and have never looked into therapy before now.

However, this time it seems worse. It started with the usual feelings of uneasiness for the first few days, but then progressed into more of a feeling of dread and helplessness and outbursts of tears (for no reason), which I had never felt before. So, I decided to call my health care provider (Kaiser in California) and ask for help. I had the choice of seeing a therapist in person locally in about 3+ weeks or seeing a therapist (not local) via Zoom in about 5 days. So, I chose the Zoom call because it seemed like the quickest way to get help.  


I'm not really sure what to think of how it went. It was mostly just the therapist interviewing me (as expected on a first visit), but it seemed like we didn't really ""connect"" personally and it seemed a bit sterile (like she didn't really care, she was just doing an interview until her next appointment). There was really no ""treatment plan"" set for me during this appointment and she didn't even address the issue of whether I need meds. or should just do CBT or other activities for the next week until our next appointment 7 days later. Plus the way there's a delay sometimes with the Zoom call didn't help as we would talk over each other.

I'm wondering if this is just my therapist and I not connecting? Is it because we were on Zoom? Do I need to call Kaiser back and ask for in person care? I'd appreciate any opinions, thank you."

I've always been scared of growing up for some reason, but lately I've been terrified of the future. My mother has physical health issues as well, so even though they are not THAT old, I get worried that something will happen before I'm ready/equipped to handle their loss and the life after that.

I'm afraid to talk about this with them because my mom also has an anxiety disorder and I know this topic is very heavy on her.

18yrtwu,Anxiety,2024-01-04,Again strong focus on my heart,"Hey guys, some of you might have read my story already somewhere here - so i make it short:
About 1.5 years ago i developed a strong panic disorder, with mostly focussing on anything heart related since it startet with a racing heart and a lot of ‚Äûheartskipping‚Äú.
During my therapy and the last 1.5 years i finally fought my way back to a normal life - still with axiety but i have it under control.

Since about a week the symptoms around my heart started to appear again. Mostly skipped bests or the feeling my heart ‚Äûdoing strange things‚Äú. I think most of you know what i mean.

After i had the first symptoms 1.5 years back i went to the ER 3 times and go everything checked. Including big blood work, many ecgs, one long time ecg, one stress ecg, one echocardiogrpahy. Everything was perfect. 

I got back into my training routine and am able to get into the high HR zones without the fear of death.

But since the symptomes came back a week ago, i am worried if it is too long ago that i got everything checked or maybe really is wrong with my heart. 

On one hand i know that this is just another phase of my anxiety but on the otherhand there are all these ‚Äûwhat if‚Äú questions.

Has anyone experienced the same or has any advice?

As I first started I loved the job and loved the familiarity. I feel really comfortable there and the work is not super stressful just emotionally taxing sometimes. 

2 months in I started getting nausea and then throwing up almost every morning. It‚Äôs so bad to the point it‚Äôs just been bile and the blood vessels in my face pop from straining.

This has been happening for months and I‚Äôve been to the doctors and gotten acid reflux pills and even had an endoscopy.

18yra4z,Anxiety,2024-01-04,Im literally so scared of doing sports,"So when I was little I used to play a lot of sports but after a few months or weeks i dropped it out of anxiety that people will laugh at me for whatever reason or something and I stopped playing sports for like 4 years or so.

 After that my friend who was playing handball suggested I should also go to this sport so we can play together. I agreed because I always feel better playing a sport with someone i know. My anxiety and stress levels were still pretty high even tho she was here but I still felt a little bit better. The first week was alright but I was hella antisocial. In the second week this one girl who was like 1 grade  higher then me (I was 12 at the time but im 13 now) started saying that I'm really bad and I took that really hard. I know that it was stupid and her calling me bad was probably the truth bt she was really tall and intimidating and those 2 are not a good combo. She also said it with a tone of voice like i really pissed her off. She was in school with me and she was like one of the popular girls in school. 

Anyway so I got scared and I swear she sometimes looked at me.with an expression like I did something so wrong to her that she could never forgive me she literally gave me the side eye from the other side of the room What did I even do...

So after that I left because I was so scared and also because I didn't really understand how to play handball and I didn't even enjoy it I just went cause my friend went. I don't even know how my friend does it cause shes like 1 year youngwr then me but she never like shows that much of a problem when someone says something bad about her she just complains a bit about it but that's it and I don't know how to get that same mindset.

I feel like it's really embarrassing since im 1 year older so I should be more careless or something right? 
Anyway after that I got really bad anxiety when my mom mentioned going to a sport. I really love volleyball and dance since I'm good at them but I'm still scared because I'll get bullied and my mom doesn't understand how hard it is to ignore people who bully me and she thinks it will be as easy as it was for her because as she said ,, I was also shy but I got over it"" and shes acting like I can get over that as easily just cause were related or idk.
 I also am really shy to go to volleyball cause I've seen literally all the girls wear shorts and I'm too self conscious since I'm a pretty skinny girl and my legs are like pretty slim and I hate that cause i think It looks weird with shorts on and yeah that's basically everything.

18yr6u2,Anxiety,2024-01-04,Medication for severe stress/nervousness?,"Hello,  
I have a few group presentations and assignments at university coming up in January. Unfortunately, I've had a lot of problems with presentations and other assignments where an audience is present since my A-levels. I don't even do badly, but I don't feel healthy at all. Often the complaints start a few days beforehand, or when I think about an event in the future! Most people say something like ""Everyone has stress and is nervous!"", but for a few years now I've found that some people's feelings of stress are comparable to mine when I watch a soccer final - in other words, marginal!  
I tend to suffer from extreme sweating, diarrhea, a feeling of stones in my stomach, loss of appetite, dry mouth, tunnel vision, sometimes even a burnt-out feeling of listlessness, as if I were ill! In my 20s, my hair is already very gray, especially visible on the sides. Of course, this could just be genetic...

I had been thinking about ""exam anxiety"" for a long time, and even suspected ""social anxiety"". I don't have any other problems like this when meeting people or in everyday life when I don't have to be the center of attention. However, it's fair to say that it's not something that I always find particularly easy compared to others. With the possible exception of dating/romance/approaches, where I have strong symptoms, which is probably also the reason why I have completely withdrawn from this area and have never had any other experiences!  
It always seems to be the ""judgmental"" factor, in situations where there is the greatest risk of being criticized, that's where the symptoms start! (All the more so, of course, if a grade or future depends on it).  
Long story short - are there any drops or similar for me in the area (Europe) that could calm my nervous nerves? I've been using Soumme's anti-perspirant roller all year to combat the sweating attacks, and it really helps! (I may also have hyperhidrosis, by the way)  
I'd be delighted to hear your answers, because further academic education is really no fun like this and is also extremely stressful for my body and psyche!

Thank you all beforehand"

18ypbzq,Anxiety,2024-01-04,Almost fainted at the dentist and I feel awful about it,"I had horrible experiences with my dentist as a kid. I have come to learn as an adult he did some unnecessary procedures on me and in addition to that he would literally have his assistant hold me down in the chair while doing those procedures. Mix that with being an undiagnosed autistic kid and yeah... not a fun time.

I have an amazing dentist now. He, and everyone else that works there, is so kind and patient. I know I am extremely difficult due to my anxiety and it's annoying that I need frequent breaks and am shaking the entire time. I needed a filling redone on my bottom tooth which requires a shot into the cheek which is the worst for me. He used some magical topical numbing thing that was INTENSE and I felt almost nothing, way better than any other dentist I've been to where they just shake your cheek and you feel everything. However, I had a vasovagal response which I have had with shots before and had to lay there freaking out and cold sweating all over the chair while they sat there awkwardly waiting for me to get my shit together. I felt awful, because I don't want to be such a bad patient that they ""fire me"" as a patient because he is truly the best dentist I have ever been to.

I was super apologetic and thankful to them but I still feel bad they have to deal with this stupid anxiety that I hate so much. I wish I could just be normal. I have tried laughing gas before with no luck, and general anesthesia also freaks me out. It feels like a step back because I was starting to feel slightly better about going to the dentist and getting shots and I had done fillings before without feeling like I was going to faint.

This is just a rant more than anything because I am frustrated with myself. I am thinking about giving them a present because I really appreciate them being so patient and kind, but I don't know if that's overkill."

18yp0bj,Anxiety,2024-01-04,Crippling anxiety about moving into my first apartment,"As an autistic person I have always been a bit scared and anxious about change. And in general I am just a very anxious person. I‚Äôve always stuck to somewhat of a routine and when something happens that‚Äôs unexpected or new I can shut down and not take it well.

For more context about this whole situation, about a month ago I got into a heated argument with my step grandma who happens to own my parents home and was told I only had a month to find a place to live that wasn‚Äôt there. My family hasn‚Äôt been very supportive and didn‚Äôt even try to get it to where I was allowed to stay. I was simply just made to deal with it. Luckily, I have my boyfriend and I have been able to find an apartment with him that is a reasonable price.

The anxiety about finding a place is gone but, it‚Äôs been replaced with extreme anxiety about moving my living space. I have always felt the need to try and take control of a situation so I can better control the outcome but, I feel like it‚Äôs kind of consuming me. I found out not too long ago that we were approved for the apartment and all I can think about is getting everything prepared and ready but, my boyfriend is taking things a lot slower than me and it‚Äôs kind of making me upset. The anxiety I feel about moving has been giving my panic attacks too. For example, the past few days me and my boyfriend have planned on shopping for things we need and every single time we just haven‚Äôt. It sent me straight into a panic attack. Thankfully his family is able to help us all out with the move and is even willing to give us things and help us buy stuff we need. Due to this he is a lot less worried than I am and I think he‚Äôs having trouble seeing where I‚Äôm coming from when I talk about how anxious I am. It‚Äôs really eating at me.

He has been very reassuring and all that but, change is still a very scary thing for me and we are both still pretty young (I‚Äôm 19 and my boyfriend is 21). Any advice on how to get through the anxiety?"

18yoidg,Anxiety,2024-01-04,A bit desperate,"Hi everyone! 

Just joined here because I am just hoping for a place to get some support or advice. 

I get so tired of myself. And I do not know how to stop it. 

I have this thing that I am very good at ""looking strong"" and reading other peoples emotion. I am a therapist by trait,  so figuren. But I have one kryptonite. When someone is angry at me, I cave. And I get so so anxious and cannot let it go until it is fixed.  Even when someone is unrightfully angry. For example, I had a client who is angry with me because she feels like I ""do not care about her"" - I know this is a traumarespons and I rationally know I am not doing thing wrong. So I will not react towards the cli√´nt but I just cannot let it go. It feels like someone is pulling on my chest and I feel so trapped.  Like a small child that is being yelled at and cannot get away. It feels like there is nothing I can do to call it. I trying to watch tv, color, write, run, ... but I keep feeling so anxious.  And I know the only moment it gets better is when the angry person is no longer angry and I will go over my own boundaries to make that happen. 

And I KNOW I should just let it go, but it feels like my body is telling me ""I am in danger"" even though I am rationally aware that I am not. 

I just don't know what to do. There is a reason like this every day that makes me so anxious it gets hard to function."

I'm having a bit of a problem the past few days. I always have anxiety in some way or another, but the weeks prior to Christmas I was doing relatively okay! I went back to the family home the past 2 weeks and that was hell for me (most of my anxiety and trauma stems from there.) Now I'm back home and I expected things to be better, but I feel like the stress I felt there and anxiety I constantly had has come back home with me and now I don't really know what to do? I guess I only need time to get over it again but I hate that I feel like this right now and I just wanna relax. The reason I think it feels 'random' is because I am at home and thought I'd immediately feel better again...

Is there anything I can do to quicken the process? I have OCD so I get very annoying intrusive thoughts all the time.

Thanks for any advice!"

It was bad as freak for a few days until i took magnesium which got rid of most of the terrible anxiety and the inability to eat and or even work normally, and honestly i think I was just deficient in magnesium, but anyhow it still persists bad, just the anxiety and now whenever i take medicines or even drink teas I get really anxious and honestly i think its just my brain overthinking if im going to have a bad reaction to something, like even now I get very anxious of something bad happening when I take magnesium its not helping no more. Today I even tried to drink ginger tea and i start feeling anxious. Its weird I cant even take tylenol or anything without panicking the freak out and plus it dosent help that i search up side effects and interactions, but not even that it persists randomly like i could be having the best time of my life and then i think about my anxiety or i just get the feeling and then boom out of nowhere and i gotta calm my self down or just thug it out, very uncomfortable feeling i hate it. Also now I've been getting arrhythmia's like i breathe out or breathe in my heart pounds hard once then continues normally and i take a budesonide inhaler and that worries me something might be wrong with my heart or my thyroid. Also very recently like yesterday at 2 am i was praying to god to help me and then out of nowhere i started thinking i was schizophrenic because i kept on like having a back and forth convo with myself like i'd tell myself ""you want this"" and then I would say ""no i dont"" n it didnt help i searched up the symptoms ik its just my anxiety but man am i scared still. Anyways all I am asking for is just some tips that you guys have used to overcome the stuff i've been through or just some overall tips. I need help what doctor i should go to, like what they specialize in, but even then its difficult i dont have any health plan or nothing, keep in mind im under eighteen I got a semi wealthy grandpa i could ask to help but even then I dont feel like using him.

I do have generalized anxiety disorder but this is the first time this has happened and I'm almost 30. I'm not on meds, and I do smoke üçÉ which usually helps my anxiety.

However, did some googling saw it could be gum disease related. I usually haven't had mouth problems, brush three times a day, could be better at flossing. Haven't been to the dentist since covid (a lot of had to do with not having insurance for many years). 

This of course lead my anxiety to spiral. I have a dentist appointment scheduled for March 11th. But I am now goolging gum disease symptoms. Im second guessing if I have those symptoms. To make matters worse I flossed my teeth very intensly twice a day and now my gums are sore and a bit bruised. But my head keeps telling me it is like that cause of gum disease and not my excessive flossing. Worried my teeth are gonna fall out which I know is crazy. Was given a piece of chocolate this morning and felt a slight pain which has just made me panic.

But the last few months something has changed in me.

Now I struggle to get out of my car to enter a grocery store in a less desirable part of town. I canceled a retreat I was supposed to go to because I was scared of being somewhere new alone. I used to look around the world at people and see beauty and the promise of new expierences and connection. Now I look around and feel fear, sadness, and a general lack of faith in society and belief in people being good. I also stay up almost every night with the paralyzing fear of losing someone I love.

Ive been unable to keep any food down from how nauseous theyve made me and so i havent eaten a proper meal since the 30th. ive been to the emergency room and they gave me half of a benzodiazepine to take at that time, half of one to take home, a prescription for sertraline then sent me on my way as i had my first therapy appointment the next day and i guess they assumed that would fix everything. I still cant eat, if im not having an attack im anxious, i feel weak and i cant really get up and go out. my therapist and i discussed many coping mechanisms such as splashing my face with water, eating sour candy, going for walks, distractions, reaching out to loved ones. Some things help but only temporarily. I just want to go back to normal, before this i only experienced mild anxiety and could function perfectly fine. Now i cant stop ruminating on my past mistakes and calling myself an awful person. I am so desperate for any advice at all, anything is appreciated. Sorry if this is all over the place."

But now technology is so advanced in so many ways I‚Äôm not even going to begin to list, that life is ‚Äúeasier‚Äù in so many ways. Leaving more time for other things. (One example: ordering food.

Now we have allll this saved time to just sit in our minds and worry about things that don‚Äôt need to be worried about. Having anxiety about normal stuff because we have so much time to overthink.

Well, that‚Äôs in two weeks and out of the 12 guys he invited I‚Äôm the only one that is undecided. I have very bad anxiety and panic disorder and for whatever reason my whole life I cannot sleep if I‚Äôm in the room with other people other than my wife. 

Work trips , bachelor parties, you name it. I‚Äôm always miserable and the most I will get is probably two hours total all night in and out.

He said the set up will be all 12 guys in bunkbeds next to each other   

Honestly, it‚Äôs my biggest fear and I‚Äôve been stressing out about it because there is a group text and everyone keeps asking when I‚Äôm going to decide   

We have lots of guys in our class that have said they snore really loud so I have to decide going into it if I‚Äôm willing to do a three day retreat, knowing I won‚Äôt get any sleep. They also follow a schedule during the day so it‚Äôs not like I could just go take a two hour nap to catch up.

I got my current job in October. For the most part, I‚Äôve really liked it. But my boss seems to also be an anxious person and she tends to be really intense/aggressive. We have an important meeting coming up next week and her nerves seem to have been off the charts. (Not sure if it‚Äôs sexist to mention this, but she‚Äôs also pregnant, and that may be playing a factor.)

Recently I‚Äôve had a few instances of intense anxiety surrounding my job, and specifically whether my boss is happy with me and my performance. I‚Äôm truly trying my best, but there have been some miscommunications that don‚Äôt feel like they were completely my fault, but they may as well have been because I know they‚Äôve frustrated my boss.

So many thoughts are going through my head.  I‚Äôm worried that my boss doesn‚Äôt like me, that she isn‚Äôt happy with my work, and that she sees me as incompetent. I‚Äôm worried that I *am* incompetent and that I‚Äôm doomed to lose this job, too.

In April of last year I flipped a leaf and really had a grip on my ocd, I was at my happiest and made so much improvement in such little time. At the end of December I moved 5000km across the country to experience a change and pursue my dreams of adventure; that whole process was super stressful and hard ofc but my ocd never really resurfaced until I‚Äôve finally settled in my new location. 

I know relocation depression is a thing but I‚Äôm just not sure why I have it. I like to think I have a strong mindset after years of battling with this.  I know what I‚Äôm doing is right, I‚Äôm not second guessing my decisions, I feel really really good about this move. But EVERYTHING else is bugging me again. Like stuff that‚Äôs not even relevant to moving, it‚Äôs just all the same thoughts that bothered me in 2021 like hocd, pocd, rocd, health ocd, etc. Getting a lot of Intrusive thoughts, a lot of repetitive thoughts. I‚Äôm also experiencing all the physical symptoms of course, super tight chest, headaches, insomnia, little to no of appetite, bursts of tears with no emotion behind it, feeling uneasy and panicky, the list goes on.
Of course I can‚Äôt beat myself up over it but I‚Äôm just so discoursed I‚Äôm back into this cycle, I thought I had it under control. 

I‚Äôve been using thc and lorazepam to help the symptoms but it just makes me feel guilty for using drugs to manage symptoms. Idk if I just have to wait it out but I hate feeling like this. I just wanna sleep all day so I don‚Äôt have this pressure in my chest. Ughhhhh help."

18yix2f,Anxiety,2024-01-04,How do I better myself without OCD sabotaging me? Is this mania or just OCD?,"This post is long so if you want you can just read the **bolded** lines. 

**I've been entertaining the idea of going back to church, working out, and thinking/speaking more positively about myself and others. It's making me really happy and excited to think about the life that I can have when I imagine all the positive changes that I'm trying to make in the New Year. My problem is that every time I try to make a positive change or try to pull myself out of the fear and depression that OCD gives me, I think that I'm actually experiencing bipolar mania and not natural happiness. (I am not diagnosed bipolar, I am diagnosed with chronic OCD).**

Every once in a while I vow to make changes, big changes, in order to pull myself out of this OCD slump that I've been in for the past couple of years. I start to exercise, I make healthier food choices, I stop gossiping and talking badly about others and myself, and sometimes I even make a change in my appearance (i.e. wardrobe change, wearing different makeup, or a haircut, which I'm actually getting later today. I haven't cut my hair in 2 years, so this is huge for me). From time to time, going back to church shows up on that list, but I never fully commit to going back because it scares me into thinking I'm manic. 

For context, I grew up in the Christian church and only recently left about 5-7 years ago (I'm 27F).  When I think back on the time that I was the happiest, had the least amount of anxiety, and was the most content with my life, it was during the stretch of years when I was actively participating in my church community. Since leaving, my depression, anxiety, and OCD has become severe. So going to church isn't exactly an insane 180 coming out of left field, I have lots of friends and some family there.

What scares me most about all of these big changes at once, going to church especially, is that being manic often results in a negative impact on your life. My husband is an AVID hater and critic of the Christian church and all who follow the religion. If I go back to church, theres a pretty good chance that it'll negatively impact my marriage and may even result in divorce. Knowing this, I should not have any desire to attend, but I still want to and get excited over the idea. Does this point to mania? Or is this OCD kicking into overdrive?

**How am I supposed to know the difference between mania and just making grand plans and being very excited to start on all of them? Do normal people feel this way too? Is OCD sabotaging me yet again? How do I push through this intense feeling of fear and anxiety over making positive changes in my life? For the past 3 years, I've basically delayed or ended almost all positive changes, plans, and ideas to turn my life around and get out of this sticky messy trench because OCD (I think it's OCD) keeps warning me not to and telling me that these changes are too grand all at once and are too out of character so I'm either manic or experiencing psychosis. Please help offer insight in any way you can.**"
18yit02,Anxiety,2024-01-04,Check your Iron and Vitamin D levels!!!,"This is extremely important for those of your with depression, anxiety and depersonalization. Especially if you have any of the following symptoms at times: 1. Shortness of breath. 2. Pale skin 3. Insomnia 4. Dark circles 5. Brittle nails and hair loss 6. Cold hands and feet 7. Restless legs 8. Tendencies to chew ice 9. Depersonalization 10. Lack of focus or concentration 11. Dizziness upon standing up 12. Panic attacks 13. Seeing stars easily 14. Bluish lips and nails 15. Intense fatigue and apathy

1/3 women have low iron and don't know it. Especially if they have heavy periods. Men can have it too.

So doctors when they do a FULL iron panel tend to just focus on the ranges from the lab. Well I found out that these ranges are just an average taken from people aged 1-99. You need to find your optimal levels, not normal levels. So my ferritin levels (iron stores) were fine, but my iron saturation, total iron and MCHC were not and those had to be calculated by a total iron panel and a CBC, and then I had to not listen to standard doctors, and instead look for my optimal levels. If I had listened to my GP they would've said my levels were fine because they were on the lowest end of the *normal* range, even though they were no where near optimal. If i had listened to my GP, id still be struggling. Sally Jacks has great videos about it on YouTube. I've been correcting my iron levels, as well as taking lamotrigine (not bipolar, just for depression and OCD) and I notice I can take deeper breaths, the world doesn't look so flat and grey, my sleep is better and my mood is getting better. Do not skimp on these things. Depression and anxiety is not an SSRI deficiency, but often comes from actual deficiencies."

Horrible anxiety like thinking stuff will always go wrong. Like horribly wrong

I do want kids, but I'm gonna spend EVERY day of my life fearing for their safety. Whatever age they are, there will be a different danger

\- Fear they will get captured by someone evil

\- They'll get lost

\- Hurt badly

\- They will get addicted to drugs / alcohol

\- Fear they will get involved with bad company etc

Also, as a parent I can't stop my child from doing whatever they want. I can't just tell them to stay home all day and be super careful. They gotta live their life

18yi1h0,Anxiety,2024-01-04,Chronic Irritability,"Hello all. My mental health journey started back in 2016 when I had PPD and PPA after having my daughter. I took 100mg of Zoloft until 2017 and then weaned off of it. I went back on it in 2018 at 50mg for PMDD (both times it was prescribed by my OB/GYN) I recently weaned off of it again because while it helped with my irritability, I had no sex drive, night sweats, and just kind of felt emotionless as far as happiness went.

I've only been weaned off of it for a short time but my irritability is at an all time high. Any sound my husband makes (chewing, yawning, eating, tapping, snoring, breathing) is just sending me to a new dimension of anger. I can feel my fuse getting shorter and shorter. I'm also about to start my period so I'm sure this is my PMDD without the Zoloft.

All this to say, given the other unpleasant side effects I was having with the Zoloft, should I ask my doctor about another medication? Should I give myself more time to be completely weaned off the Zoloft and see if I feel better as it hasn't even been 3 weeks of being off the SSRI? What has worked for you? I feel like my marriage is going to be destroyed with my mood swings if I don't do something soon but at the same time if I need to just wait it out maybe I should. I see a therapist which I am planning on discussing this with but should I see a psychiatrist as well? I don't know. Please help.

I just distract myself until it comes down to the wire and then I have intense anxiety attacks and rush to finish it. Rinse and repeat. I used to criticize myself for being a lazy procrastinator, but my therapist has helped me to realize that what I call laziness is actually just extreme anxiety. I have tried to utilize this knowledge to be a better worker, but sitting down to do any task that I am anxious about is exhausting to me. It's like trying to punch/move your arms in a dream. It takes everything I have just to be a normal worker. How do people around me just get assigned tasks and work on them normally? I wish I could be that way but I just find myself endlessly procrastinating. Then I tell little white lies to cover any lack of progress, or call out of work for being sick/car trouble/etc., then just feel like a huge piece of shit afterwards.

However, recently I‚Äôve been experiencing symptoms such as the following: 

‚Ä¢head tension, almost like my skull is being squeezed, this is near my temple, top of head, back of head, this tension can extend into my jaw, neck and shoulders. 

I have noticed that it can, more or less, go down if I try to distract myself or forget about it. However I have a habit of waking up in the morning and my brain going like ‚Äúso where‚Äôs that tension/pressure? HERE IT IS!‚Äù And then.. boom. Chronic. 

‚Ä¢occasional nausea 

‚Ä¢ disassociation, like I almost feel as if I‚Äôm either floating or don‚Äôt exist.

I actually went to a walk in hospital clinic the other week (and have an appointment with my local gp on Monday) and they assessed me, blood pressure and everything, all vitals fine. They said it was most likely anxiety/depression etc etc. 

I know I probably sound ridiculous but I can be quite the hypochondriac and I keep panicking (sometimes to the point of hyperventilation) that I have something severely wrong with me (like a severe neurological disorder, a tumor etc) and I‚Äôm going to end up dead.

I know this is due to me not leaving the house for 5 days now since we are in winter break, and also looking back at all the small triggers and stressful situations i've had to face the past few months it's incredible i haven't had a meltdown until now.

I thought i was strong but one of the main triggers for me (but not the only one) has been seeing my aunt struggle with anxiety and going through the same thing i went through last year, trying to help her has brought me some horrible flashbacks and feelings i thought i wasn't gonna be affected by now, but i guess i'm not made of stone. Also i have been flooded with work at uni (i'm doing my thesis so it's kinda hard), things in the romantic area haven't been so good either, my grandma is not feeling good and i'm having some existential crisis regarding the fact that this is my last year of uni and i am going to be a full adult soon.

So taking everything into account, my mind decided to trigger these anxious feelings over the first dumb stupid intrusive thought i got, because it seems like those 5 days i have spent inside my house have stopped the hectic lifestyle i got and my brain has started to think about everything and is like ""HERE!! SOME STIMULATION!!! now u r gonna get anxious overrrrr........ \*points at random household item\*"" (it's kinda funny when u think about how the brain works lmfao). And now i'm having all the usual anxiety symptoms i used to have: appetite loss, chills, heart racing...

I found myself in this perpetual situation for several months perpetually (when I didn't yet know I suffered from anxiety).  Then I started taking anxiolytic supplements and all the cognitive and physical symptoms that anxiety caused me disappeared, including the drooping eyelid.  When the effects of the supplements wear off, the anxiety and droopy eyelids return.  This is proof that the droopy eyelid is a symptom due to anxiety, can anyone tell me if they have had the same symptom?

As said in the title, I'm so stupidly tired of being anxious all the time. I can't help but miss the days from earlier this year when I didn't worry about a thing, and all of a sudden it hit me like a truck. I've had some scares with my heart, and despite the multiple ER visits telling me I'll be okay, I still don't trust my body or myself. I'm so tempted to try and get a brain MRI from my doc or the ER due to facial tingling [of which I've had for months] even though I've already bothered her over like a million other things, and I'm still getting my heart checked out. I feel guilty wasting insurance money, but I feel like I can't stop myself. 

I'm aware I have health anxiety and OCD (Of which I've recovered from in the past), but my symptoms are getting so strange that I can't tell the difference between anything real vs my anxiety. I lose sleep over it, get attacks over it, and my brain jumps from one obsession to the other, so much so to the point that it attempts to convince me I have multiple health issues in the span of a day and I live in constant fear of death. I've done everything in my power to live a healthier lifestyle like watching my diet, getting up and being more active, being more productive and going to therapy more often but my body just won't let up.

18ycvev,Anxiety,2024-01-04,Anxiety during conflictual conversations.,"(M, 30yo)

Hi. I'm looking for ways to deal with my issue. I dealt with anxiety and mental issues all my life but today I feel good in my life overall. I still have ups and downs but I can deal with it.

It's not hard for me to talk to people in a casual context anymore because I worked on it over the years. People tend to view me as confident even. But as soon as the conversation becomes too conflictual I get all shaky and I have trouble expressing myself. Even for the most trivial things. One recent good example:

  
Two weeks ago I was looking for a harness for my dog. I saw a spike collar on the ground, the type of torture collar designed to hurt the dog. So I showed it to the seller (because it is now illegal in my region) as I geniunely thought it was still here by mistake. He went full on defendind the thing, which made me really unconfortable. I told him as best as I could that I thought it was wrong and there was other means way more respectful of the dog. He was calm, but on the other end there was like a **storm in my head**. I couldn't keep calm and express myself clearly.

This happens all the time and as i'm unable to defend myself people **tend to get bossy**. 

I do know it is related with my father being angry all the time when i was a kid because I get exactly the same feeling. I feel **suppressed, shaky and unable to stand for myself**. I used to flee those kind of situations but now i'm a grown up and I want to be able to deal with it. I'm in pretty good shape, working out, eating well but it's not helping much on those particular situations. When it happens i'm **taken by surprise and I just can't react properly.**

&amp;#x200B;

So, sorry for the long post, but have you ever felt the same way, and if so, what did you do to work on it? I'm assuming there are people that struggle way more than me here so I'm taking any advice.

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks and have you all a wonderful year."
18yc9do,Anxiety,2024-01-04,Physical anxiety wearing me down,"Really just making this post just to reach out and connect during states of anxiety. I am currently feeling very physically shaken, tired, anxious. My thoughts are stable, and I don‚Äôt have any racing thoughts or any thoughts of self-harm, it‚Äôs just a pure feeling of physical anxiety, muscle tension, restlessness, stomach problems, and a slight feeling of overall illness. I do feel somewhat lonely and down but these are not extreme feelings, just general depression. 

Currently on Lexapro. That helps somewhat, and it‚Äôs much better than being off of it. I took 25mg of Benadryl just to calm down just a bit, and that is helping a bit currently as of right now.

I was prescribed Buspirone a few months ago. That did help at first, but then suddenly stopped being effective, and I noticed it was making me very dizzy and more tired all of a sudden, like my heart is racing. 

I stay away from most caffeine, other than a very small half cup of coffee in the morning (which is all I can tolerate and it generally boosts my mood). I try to drink lots of water. 


I had recently come down with COVID over the holidays, and that was terrible for my anxiety. I had bad panic, worry and couldn‚Äôt sleep. Eventually that did subside a bit as I got over COVID, even though I do feel some residual effects. I really think COVID kinda made me go haywire and kick my anxiety back up. 

Basically I was seeing a therapist prior and they had once given me Propranolol , and that was super effective for calming me down when needed. However the therapist office lost funding and I couldn‚Äôt get the medicine refilled from my former therapist anymore. So I had seen a general practitioner and they tried Celexa instead and that made things worse, then they tried Lexapro and Buspirone. Everything was good with that, except for the Buspirone. 

Today I am waiting out a few hours when my doctors office opens so I can see about getting back on Propranolol , just to help with the physical symptoms of anxiety, worry, and panic that I am dealing with. 

Wish me luck"

18y9qby,Anxiety,2024-01-04,Recently prescribed propranolol,"Hi there, long story


I‚Äôm a 23F and on Christmas Eve Eve, I had an SVT at my job. I‚Äôm a transporter at a hospital (Thank God because the ED is a floor down). I was talking to my boss about something that was going on at work that was stressing me out. The conversation wasn‚Äôt unpleasant or anything. After we were done talking, I stood up and suddenly the episode hit. Now, I‚Äôve had palpitations in the past from anxiety. This was not that. My HR went from 70-80BPM to 200. And climbed. Went pale, could barely walk. Craziest thing ever. My boss sent me downstairs immediately, my EKG was taken, and it was totally normal. Vitals were normal. They put me in an exam room. The minute the technician shut the door, it happened again, and it was the worst. 80 BPM. 100. 130. 160 (oh shit, haven‚Äôt seen that before). 180. 220. I hit a max HR of 242. I can see through the window on the door one of the nurses, who makes eye contact with me panicking. And that‚Äôs when rapid response comes in
Vagal maneuvers didn‚Äôt work. Ice didn‚Äôt work. So they slap on cardioversion pads and give me adenosine. HR successfully dropped to about 120 BPM. They keep me overnight and determine my heart is structurally well. Stress test clear. BP was really good. Blood work was all cleared (minus the D-Dimer but, because hey! Body just ran a marathon).


They sent me home with metoprolol and the doctor kinda said ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre young! Only take it if your HR hits 198 BPM which is your 100% capacity.‚Äù (????) Had a follow up with my primary because of some chest pain and because the metoprolol was dropping my HR and BP wayyy too low. (30BPM). When I told my doctor everything she said ‚ÄúThe doctor said what?‚Äù And that I shouldn‚Äôt even be taking metoprolol because of my asthma. She was heavily under the impression that it may be anxiety related, and thought propranolol would be nicer to my body, which is where my questions come in‚Ä¶



A. has anyone experienced this before??
B. I was prescribed 10mg once a day. I‚Äôm on day three today and I woke up in the middle of the night, BP 140/88, HR 130 from laying. I couldn‚Äôt even lift an arm without my HR jumping. Is that a normal effect from the medication just wearing off? Does anyone else experience this? My first time taking it, I took my first dose at 5:30ish PM because the doctor wanted me to start asap and see if it helped my symptoms. So with that, I slept perfectly fine. When I woke up yesterday, I took it at 8AM to see how well the medication would work during my ‚Äúworking hours‚Äù. But with that, it wore off by around 8PM the same day and minimal activity made my HR jump for sure‚Ä¶ which leads up to now. I just woke up with my HR climbing, BP elevated, and shaking like a madman.



Thank you for reading all this if you‚Äôve made it this far. I have struggled with anxiety since I was a teenager. But this is the most it‚Äôs manifested physically. I‚Äôm hoping this is manageable and I didn‚Äôt stress myself into a poor state of health (although so far, doctors really believe I‚Äôm healthy and can‚Äôt find a cause for my attack bcs !!! What healthy person has a HR of 242??)


P.S Feel like I should note that all this did start after an exceptionally stressful couple of months between home and work and an eating disorder relapse."

They used to be sporadic, but now they‚Äôve become a lot more frequent and intense. 

I‚Äôve had at least 1 panic attack each day since the beginning of the week. Always with a racing heartbeat, lightheadedness, shortness of breath, and shaking/trembling. 

Yesterday, I had a panic attack that lasted ~16 hours. I went to the doctor and had an EKG and blood work done, but everything came back normal. It was one of the worst days of my life - at some point my heart rate shot up to 152 bpm and no grounding exercises seemed to work.

Does anyone else experience daily / long panic attacks, or is there something horribly wrong with me? My health anxiety is killing me and it‚Äôs exacerbating my already terrifying panic attacks. I keep obsessively checking my Apple Watch to see what my heart rate is.

I tried to sleep peacefully today, but an hour into my sleep I woke up with a racing heart. I‚Äôm so worried that what I‚Äôm experiencing is not a panic attack, but rather a serious, life-threatening condition.

18y8wt7,Anxiety,2024-01-04,Anxious about partners wellbeing,"My partner (F23) and I (M23) have been together for around 10 months. I am madly in love with her, very convinced that she is the woman I want to spend the rest of my life with. She used to have Blood Cancer as a child and has been cancer free for the past 9-10 years. 
Recently we done a blood test for her and the doctor advised her ALT levels are high for a person with a healthy life style who's physically active. This has triggered a tremendous amount of anxiety in me. I am constantly worried about this being a secondary form of cancer and I cannot function. This is my first time dealing with anxiety so paralysing. I don't think I am a very religious person, yet I cannot stop praying for her health and safety. All of this is happening because of elevated ALT levels and no other symptoms, her doctor has advised her liver function test look normal and there were no other abnormalities in her blood which I'm sure is a good sign. She did also have a mildly severe case of COVID just before her blood test. I am just so terrified of losing the love of my life. I am literally fucking crying right thinking about it and I don't know how to cope. I can't talk to her about it as much as I need to because I don't want to trigger her health anxiety (understandbly she has health anxiety and PTSD due to her cancer). I just feel so lost. I don't know what I can do.. help me, tell me what you think of the elevated ALT levels, is my fear reasonable? What can I do?

18y8bgj,Anxiety,2024-01-04,Anxiety regarding computer issues.,"Hello! This post might feel a little, odd? In regards to the things that trigger my anxiety. But to give a little bit of background, I have general anxiety as well as some pretty bad social anxiety, so, this causes me to spend a lot more time indoors working on things on the computer in my free time. This by no means is me saying I spend *all* my time inside, just, a good majority. Which brings me to the issue at hand. I have anxiety regarding computer issues, the idea of my computer having any problem overwhelms me (As a big stress for me would be having to spend money to repair/upgrade certain things.)

I believe I might have some OCD tendacies with it too in regards to constant checking, seeing if space on my computer is running low, or, for that matter doing a lot of ""spring cleaning"" on my computer in an attempt to prevent further issues, which, then turns into me cycling back to checking and, if anything is even SLIGHTLY off from the day prior I get overwhelmed and have to go into problem-solving mode again.

I was curious if others happened to have any advice on how to properly avoid doing this routine of checking + problem solving because of anxiety. I've brought it up with a therapist a few months ago but it felt like it wasn't really something they had a good suggestion on. It feels weird being so anxious about something like this, but, because of the anxiety regarding it a lot of my enjoyment for things on the computer (Such as games and the like) get thrown out the window because I'm so focused on trying to keep it working that I push aside likes and interests. I mainly just am hoping to get some advice on overcoming this over time.

how do I know that the teacher hasn't reacted because I wrote nonsense or that her mood disappears when I write to her ( I don't know why I think so, she has never said don't write to me, she has always thanked me, from her text message ""you always surprise me"" I can understand that she liked to receive it.
Didn't she reply to the message because I had already apologised earlier if she felt uncomfortable because I was communicating with her? She replied 4 months ago that everything was fine and she didn't want to write the same thing a second time because, its silly thinking  how can I drop down mood her when i write beautifull words to her in every celebrate ( like teacher day, christmas....? I'm distressed about this situation.... how can I not think that she is not discovering that I am a jerk, or that she just doesn't see any problem with me writing to her.... I remember that she supported me as a moron and an insane person because I wrote the same thing the second time"

18y78xh,Anxiety,2024-01-04,People asking me if I'm okay makes me anxious.,"It happens fairly often, maybe il be more quiet than usual mostly because I'm just calm. Then my wife or someone will notice and just keep asking if I'm okay throughout the day. 

This progressively makes me more and more anxious, like something is up and I've not noticed, I get paranoid and down. I don't know if it's the paranoia or I just lean into the idea of not being okay but it really ruins days and sometimes even weeks as my mind can't stop worrying about why the they was asking and whether I was really okay to begin with.

How do I get over this? Is this normal? Does anyone else feel the same? I feel like being asked if I'm okay should improve my mood but it just does the opposite."
18y78t6,Anxiety,2024-01-04,Financial med school stress,"I am the first person in my family to ever earn a graduate degree my dad did not even go to college at all, but both of my parents have always pushed me to do my best in school and the medical field. I have always wanted to do medicine since i was young, thankfully I achieved this goal but did not realize all that came with it.

 My family and I decided the best option m would be for me to go to an international medical school that had a good reputation of matching back to canada. This came with a lot of expenses and my parents were unable to get a loan due to loans on properties and etc. Since the canadian dollar has been increasingly dropping compared to the euro it has made it nearly impossible to pay for tuition and accommodation. Every single day i near panic attacks at the thought of them not being able to make payments and my unpredictable class schedule makes it impossible to have a job. Most other kids at my school have family members that are doctors or in general come from fairly wealthy families and are always able to spend money freely whereas i worry about having enough leftover to buy grocery and the constant guilt of my parents spending all their money on my education eats away at me, at one pint my parents had less than 1000 dollars after paying my fees. I just wanted to vent and I really hope this all works out and im able to repay my parents for all their sacrifices.

PS if anyone has any easy recommended ways to make money online or easily with flexibility of hours please let me know."
18y6xoz,Anxiety,2024-01-04,Feel like I‚Äôm going to die every day,Context I was drugged and sexually assaulted  and died a couple months ago and then was brought back. This happened after rejecting someone and trying to leave an abusive situation and for trying to expose a police department for drug and sex trafficking and for knowing bad things about scary important people. I also used to struggle with substance abuse so it would be a believable story or plausible if I died of an overdose no one would question it. I did not willingly ingest these drugs. Fast forward to today I was also shot at months after that and then assaulted multiple times by strangers and then assaulted by the police a couple times after that again(sexually and physically). I am not ok and can barely look people in the eyes or go outside without feeling like someone is going to kill me or sexually assault me.Is there advice anyone has for trying to overcome the anxiety I am going through? I don‚Äôt really have any friends or anyone to share what I have been through. I go for walks or have tried exercising but a man almost jumped out of a window and screamed at me near the railroad the other day and I am scared to go on my runs but working out is really healthy for me.

18y6bpg,Anxiety,2024-01-04,Question about propranolol,"Hello fellas. Have little story, kind of hard to write but lets try. I been having insane heart pulse jumps, especially on hangovers. Not sure if its panic or not, but I remember waking up on hangover and my heart went to 200+ over. Been like 5 times, mostly hangovers, but happened also on sober days ( mostly after heavy meals ). Doctor prescribed propranolol, she said take 40mg in morning and check how its gonna be in day, you can also take 40mg in evening. What I did is I took first time only half pill (20mg) and never took more than that. I did some horrible things, I took it first time when I came back from city after drinking many drinks, my heart was 130-140 when I was laying. I was like okay fk it and I will just take this, I took it and went to sleep after like 20min. I woke up without hangover ( thats not normal because I always have hangover ) and when I woke up my heart was like 70-80, when on hangover its always like 140-150, if I get bad minds it goes to 200. Okay, that was first time. Next time I  took it before I went to party, my heart always was like 100 when drunk, when normal was always 130-150 while being drunk. Then I felt like its god drug and I started taking it always before OR while OR after being drunk. Everything goes well, but I feel doing very wrong. I mean I dont have any side effects or anything, but feeling doing very wrong with this medicine. The thing is, if I dont take it, my heart goes sometimes so fast I cant even understand why. I had heart tests and everything, they said my heart is healthy. I dont think its panic attacks, because last time when I had heart rate over 200+ I felt kind of calm and it was racing soooo bad. I know I should avoid alcoho, but the point is that I want to figure out wtf is wrong with me because its not because of alcohol. I had it also when I was sober. Alcohol just makes it come faster. Whats wrong with me? What should I do? Sorry for bad grammar and bad sentences. "

18y60l2,Anxiety,2024-01-04,Help with Meds,"I'm 19F and have trial and errored 9 different medications including Biphentin, Fluoxetine, Sertraline, Strattera, Quetiapine, Risperidone, Dextroamphetamine, and Lamotrigine (and I think Clonidine but I can't find my notes), most having really bad effects on myself and meds just don't seem to work. I have Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), Hallucinogen Persisting Perception Disorder (HPPD) (permanent), severe Social and General Anxiety, Major Depressive Disorder, Derealization-Depersonalization, and really bad insomnia.  


With trying so many meds in a short period of time HPPD effects worsened, and eventually more so with some substance use eventually leading to a schizo-affective type disorder. It's hard to find a good med as I don't handle brain fog/heavy headspaces well, stims crash hard and cause hppd/psychosis and insomnia symptoms to worsen, many drag me down and pit me in depression (very handled now and I don't want it to ever get worse), and most dissociate me more meaning many anti-anxiety medications don't work.  


Too make it clear I'm not looking for anything for hallucinations or depression, but something that won't worsen those things, as well as help manage dissociation/depersonalizing/help focus and anxiety. Also looking for something for sleep.  


I don't smoke weed or do other substances except maybe once a year, I drink every so often, but get drunk very rarely, I smoke on special occasion and often vape, and drug or other addictions aren't a worry. I don't have a fast metabolism and other than bad care habits I don't have any health problems and am not immuno-compromised. Am sensitive (skin or heartburn for example) but have no known allergies.  


Looking for any medications, shroom strains, drug microdosing, or even supplements or superfoods that based on this information would be the likely best benefit for my type, and want to know what's worked for any of you with an anxiety-dissociation combo. I'm open to any suggestions, and articles or management tips too.

18y5wsa,Anxiety,2024-01-04,Xanax,"I had my first panic attack when I was about 27 (42 now) and my doctor prescribed me Xanax 1mg. Around 6 years ago I was bumped up to 4mg per day (2mg twice a day).

I have terrible heart anxiety, which until a month ago was completely in my head, but made me a nervous wreck. I couldn‚Äôt stand in open fields (like my kids soccer game) as I would worry there is no where to go if I have another panic attack.

Recently, I had an EKG and heart echo that revealed possible minor damage. I have a nuclear stress test scheduled for next Friday and I am absolutely terrified. I wake up terrified, I go to sleep terrified. 

I know that 4 mg is generally the maximum a doctor will prescribe. I have read about 4 mg per day spread out over 3 doses, how exactly does that work?

I have an appointment tmw with my family doctor for my usual Xanax refill, and I‚Äôm really curious if I have hit the maximum Xanax level. Has anyone gone through this situation? 

Does it keep you more level by taking 3x a day instead of 2?

I don‚Äôt want the doctor to think I am just trying to up my xanny for the hell of it. They were the ones I first reported my heart problem to, and they know my history of anxiety and panic attacks. What is the best way to approach this with my dr?"

18y5l7o,Anxiety,2024-01-04,Mad how I handled my C word scare (M20),"
I have self diagnosed myself with advanced prostate cancer after having pissing issues earlier in the 2023 that I ignored. I feel like a fool for not going to a doctor,  but the reason why I didn‚Äôt go to a doctor is because I thought it was more of a pelvic floor issue. In order to piss, I would bring my phone out and start scrolling then the piss would come out fine. 

Fast forward to now I lost 13 pounds in a span of a month and a half, chest pains, shortness of breath and classic cancer symptoms. The only thing that hasn‚Äôt happened yet is I‚Äôm not pissing blood or ejaculating blood. 

My other symptoms started mid October, like headaches, blood in stool so I was convinced I had a brain tumor or colon cancer when I should have been getting the piss issues checked out instead. It turns out my CT scans of head, pelvic and abdomen, multiple x rays, blood work, colonoscopy, endoscopy and PSA all came out good which has me stumbled. 

I‚Äôm seeing a urologist next and getting my prostate checked out so I‚Äôm hoping it‚Äôs nothing serious but considering the other symptoms I doubt it. I‚Äôm only 20 years old so the fact I might have prostate cancer has me fucking perplexed, that would mean I was showing symptoms since I was 19 years old. 

Either way, I wish I got my symptoms checked out sooner and possibly gave myself a death sentence waiting this long. I hope you guys get checked out sooner than I did and don‚Äôt be a fool like me. I don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôm going to explain to my parents that I ignored my pissing issues and their son is going to die at 20 because of my ignorance"

18y5csb,Anxiety,2024-01-04,Pregnancy Scare Anxiety???? Help!,"Pregnant From Anal..?

Ok I know this is *ridiculous* but I cannot stop worrying - I'm so anxious and can't take a pregnancy test for another ten days to confirm what I suspect to be true, which is that I can't be pregnant, but I am just totally freaking out. I get this insane pregnancy anxiety about every other month from absolutely minor sexual encounters, and this month is no different. Beware, it gets a little inappropriate... 

My fiance and I tried anal sex (unprotected) for the first time last week. I am not on any kind of birth control because we don't like the idea of all the hormones, and we don't do PIV. Generally it's just oral or using our hands. Anyway, we wanted to try something new last week, so we gave anal a try. I was on the bottom the whole time with him on top of me, and he came inside. Then we laid like that for a minute or so before he pulled out. He grabbed a towel and put it under me and I laid like that for a few moments before I went to the bathroom. I stayed in there for about ten minutes, constantly wiping (front to back) and trying to get out as much of *it* as I could. After everything was coming back dry, I washed up with some soap, got dressed and we went about our evening. I didn't feel anything else come out. 

This was on day 8 of my cycle. According to the Flo app, I'm supposed to ovulate today, which is day 13. So, technically, I would have been just barely in my fertile window when this incident occurred. However, I've been taking some OPK tests every day since then to figure out when I ovulate (trying to put my mind at ease) and I haven't had an LH surge yet, which means I might ovulate later than today, meaning that 6 days before ovulation would basically be impossible to get pregnant. I'm also worried that somehow I may have ovulated early this cycle, which is why I haven't gotten a surge.... If that's the case, chances are higher that I was in my fertile window for the month. 

I know that anal sex does not directly lead to pregnancy - what is making me so anxious is everything I read online that says it's *technically* possible if semen were to run or drip into my vulva. As I mentioned, I was on the bottom the whole time (my bottom was never positioned above my vulva) until I was sitting up in the bathroom, but I was very careful to wipe everything away. What I'm stressed about is that perhaps some of the semen got into the lube that we used (which was all over my lower area, and even smeared a bit on my vulva) and traveled up into me before I had the chance to wipe it away. I'm also worried that perhaps I wasn't as diligent at wiping myself in the bathroom as I thought I was and maybe some semen was able to make it's way inside at that point. 

I am freaking out! I have done this many times before where I convince myself that I'm somehow pregnant from some kind of sexual encounter, whether it's oral or kissing or some insane way that semen may have been transferred to me, and of course I have never been pregnant. My fiance is frustrated because I talk myself into this idea that I'm pregnant and it's all I can think about until I can take a pregnancy test. I'm frustrated too, but I just cannot let it go and can't seem to tell myself that I won't be the 1 in a thousand that it happens to. Thoughts????"

Been gradually improving since the first couple years of it through therapy and increase in lifestyle wellness, as well as lavender essential oil. While I'm in a stable spot now relatively, still experience a lot of rumination, and occasional anxiety attacks involving nausea. Was trying to find information on certain gene mutations that may be causing nutritional deficiencies, came across folic acid and the MTHR gene mutation that apparently affects a fair amount of the population, but there was also some controversy around it. Furthermore, was reading about COMT, this just from page one of google but it reads ""People with underactive COMT variants have high epinephrine and norepinephrine levels. This makes them worse at coping with stress. Imbalances in catecholamine neurotransmission put them at increased risk of some anxiety disorders."" Also some people suggesting vitamin B9.

&amp;#x200B;

 I'm going to keep going into it, but was just wondering if anyone has already done a deep dive into this stuff?

I‚Äôm 22 years old, and have been dealing with really bad anxiety since I was about 7 years old (I‚Äôve suffered from depression and PTSD as well all together). I used to only suffer from frequent headaches and panic attacks til I was 18. However, the past few years I‚Äôve been suffering from heart palpitations when I get very anxious. When I have panic attacks they get frequent. I end up going to the hospital and they tell me there‚Äôs nothing wrong with me and it‚Äôs normal. Does anyone else deal with this? No one around me understands and I wonder if there‚Äôs others who have to unfortunately deal with this problem too."
18y1pxo,Anxiety,2024-01-04,"is it a brain tumor, aneurysm, or just made up symptoms in my head??","sorry for long ish post

hi, to preface i am 21 and i have had health anxiety for around 2 years. its the worst feeling ever. two weeks ago, i contracted COVID. fortunately, my symptoms were kinda mild and i tested negative after like 6 days. However, during day 2 or 3 of my infection, i started developing a headache. at first i thought nothing of it but then i made the STUPID decision of searching it up and finding brain tumors and aneurysms. i was so scared because the headache didn‚Äôt go away with advil and acetaminophen. i thought i had an aneurysm because i masturbated a couple of times during the time i was quarantined and got scared that i caused myself to have an aneurysm. 

The following days after i tested negative were hell because i was thinking abt the headache 24/7. it seemed to give me dizziness and hurt everytime i laid my head back a bit or faced down. which scared me even more since its a positional headache and thats another symptom of brain tumor. it also seemed to be pulsing at night and it hurt. however i never threw up or had brain fog or anything.  my neck and shoulders are still stiff till this day and that also gives me anxiety. i‚Äôm going back to school soon and will get checked up by the dr at school but i‚Äôm scared that it‚Äôs a tumor or aneurysm. anyone else have this problem?"
18y1l6o,Anxiety,2024-01-04,Let‚Äôs talk about Gym Anxiety,"As the New Year rolls around, so do allll of the resolutions to get fit, be better, start over, and challenge current bad habits. My husband and I are doing this, while giving ourselves grace, by finally agreeing to be more intentional with our diets and workouts (or lack thereof). The bad part? We struggle from MAJOR gym anxiety, especially the hubs. It‚Äôs something that so many of us anxious folks must experience, but how on earth do you get over it? Gym anxiety leads to body-image anxiety, which has had a nasty grip on my husband for the last few years. I‚Äôm proud of us because we just scheduled time at a Cross-Fit-esque local gym, and are meeting with the coach next week to chat! My worry is that my husband will go, feel self conscious, and then immediately back out of our desired plan and goals. This is a pattern for him, as he will agree to try a fitness routine for a couple weeks, but after a few days becomes so burnout from self-consciousness and the effort required to follow through that we bail on the plan. 

Others who experience gym anxiety ioety, what has helped you break this cycle? I‚Äôm hopeful for this new path we‚Äôre on in 2024, but fear being let down again from anxiety that is not my husband‚Äôs fault. This is just word vomit at this point, but I figured we could find support here."

If you asked me to sit down and explain a topic to you, I probably could. But tests? Absolutely not. I've also had some schools not honor my accommodations which have ended disastrously. I get so anxious about everything and how my grades never reflect me accurately and how it's going to keep me from graduating. I'm in health care in a competitive field, I may never graduate, and then what? I'll have been in school for 7+ years with no degree and a shitty transcript that doesn't accurately reflect me?

18y0zhn,Anxiety,2024-01-04,Cause of dizziness and dissociation?,"I have felt really dizzy and out of it the past week or so. My vision feels a little blurry and I have tunnel vision. I am wondering if you guys can please tell me if one of the three actions below may have caused this? Thank you!

I smoked two hits of a weed I have smoked before and had no problems with, and didn‚Äôt feel like this until 4 or 5 days after smoking. I only smoke once every 3 months and this is a strain that never makes me anxious or gets me too high. If my symptoms didn‚Äôt kick in until days after, is there any way it was caused by the weed? I hope not.

The second potential cause was that I had to take Benadryl three times over a day and a half, spaced out, because I was visiting my parents that have a dog. I have taken two Benadryls at once before and never had this feeling linger so maybe this is not the reason.

The final reason is I have been going most days recently not eating until around 6pm and then eating a really big meal all at once and that is my entire food consumption for the day. I also have been waking up at around 2pm. 

Could a bad eating schedule/intermediate fasting and only cramming all my calories into one meal be the cause of dizziness and dissociation or is it more likely that one of the previous two situations caused me to experience drdp symptoms? If it is the nutrition, could it take a few days of a better eating schedule to feel better? Thank you!"

I have health anxiety. I always have when Covid started I would wash my hands even though I was indoors and couldn‚Äôt possibly have gotten it from stuff that has been in my house longer than I‚Äôve been lol. But now it‚Äôs at an intense all time high.

5 weeks ago I met someone at my university and she gave me a blowjob. Without a condom. Then we had penetrative sex with one. Immediately I started to worry that I caught an STI more specifically HIV. Especially when I got a sore throat at 2 weeks. I then got dry skin on my face for a few days and those all went away soon. Then 3 days ago I got really sick and had a fever, aching joints, sore throat, mucus-y cough, stuffy nose, diarrhea (for the last day probably from taking cold meds on an empty stomach) all that stuff. I just have a stuffy nose at this point

I have spoken to so many professionals and people on Reddit even that told me I am fine i am sick from stress, lack of sleep and probably a flu rampaging across canada right now. everyone is telling me im fine. but im just so anxious that i cant stop thinking about it.

I'm not sure 100% how to say this but I'm 14m and have grown up around the Internet (since I was around 7-8) when I was about 8 or 9 I started a youtube account with me just being really cringy and just posting random stuff of me (not NSFW but just me and my old step brother messing around pretending we're massive youtube stars) anyway me and my step brother went out of contact after family issues and my youtube account I list since it was controlled by my older step brother (He controlled it because I had no idea how to make one since you needed a email and all of that stuff) like I was saying I lost that account and it got left on YouTube from what I remember barely any views or subscribers on it but I just ignored it.

We moved away from them and since I was around 11 by this time I make a tiktok account... a 11 year old making a tiktok account...  So the same stuff I did on my youtube I did on tiktok but just a less but still cringy videos not of me singing and stuff but just me with my skateboard or posting random shit but the problem was that with this tiktok account it was my name (I have uncommon name that from what I've tried looking for no one I have ever met has my name but I'm online 14 now so maybe later ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è) so after tiktok I lost that account as well and never saw anything of it. 

Fast forward around 2 years I haven't touched social media to create anything I just use like tiktok to watch, reddit of course and so on, I've had people from my current school find the tiktok account and send me it in my snap (Not a lot of people that I know or hopefully know have heard of my account just 'friends' I hanged out with during school) so after that I just shrug it off but deep inside it scared me that they could use it for blackmail and say stuff like 'Oh yea I'll leek this to the whole school' and stuff. Fast forward again this year my youtube account that somehow people got (One of my old mates I used to be friends with but not anymore because I realised they were idiots and around 2 other people ) got held of it and I can't do anything about it because I have no idea the email or the account name and same goes for the tiktok I have no way off logging into it. 

I don't really know what I am trying to say here just that I am really paranoid and scared people will find the account and do something with it even though there's nothing on it that they can use expect old cringe videos of me messing about."

Anyways, I‚Äôm wondering if anyone else has had to go back on medicine after coming off and if a lower dose worked."
18y0148,Anxiety,2024-01-04,I felt like a criminal today,"Well, this is going to be long‚Ä¶

I have had the same doctor for the last two years. She recently left and I was assigned a new doctor that I am to see later this month. 

I‚Äôve been taking a low dose of Xanax (.25 as needed) for about a year and a half. I have started using less and less as I get more confident with managing my anxiety and now may use 30 in 2-3 months. I can request refills every 30 days but I only get them as needed. I also haven‚Äôt refilled since October (30 pills). 

I started getting low in December but was not too worried about it. The holidays come around which caused a lot of anxiety for me, resulting in me using some of my medication. Close to Christmas, I have one left and wait until the office opens back up last Thursday to request a refill. I explain I only have one left and ask if the refill can be prioritized‚Ä¶they said no. Okay, I understand.

I had a panic attack last night that resulted in me taking my final pill. This morning, I called again to check on the refill request and the receptionist was super apologetic and said she would mark it urgent. When I got off of work, I called to see if they were able to approve the request so I could stop by the pharmacy after work. She informed me that the (new) doctor said she would not prescribe me any medication unless I came in for lab work. I explained that it was fine but I had an appt scheduled later this month. They said it needed to be ASAP‚Ä¶okay. I go today and I find out that the lab work is a DRUG TEST that I also have to pay over $200 for unexpectedly (that I don‚Äôt really have right now). Fine, it‚Äôs got to be better than being so anxious about what I‚Äôm going to do if I have a panic attack! 

When the lab tech tells me the price, I request to speak with the doctor first. Why? Because I have a medical marijuana card for DC and will occasionally use medical marijuana, legally, when I am visiting the area. Of course, I was visiting the area over Christmas. I explain to her that I will test positive for marijuana due to this specific circumstance; she then accuses me of trafficking marijuana across state lines to my resident illegal state. I kind of laughed and explained again that I only use it there on vacation and because it‚Äôs legal. 

She then goes to explain that I was supposed to sign some kind of controlled substance agreement when I was originally prescribed the medication that explains they can drug test me and if I test positive for anything, they can stop prescribing. It also says I won‚Äôt sell it etc. She said this was supposed to be done a long time ago and periodically to continue allowing my prescription. I ask if that specific marijuana use is going to be an issue and she says she doesn‚Äôt know. 

Long story short, I paid $230 for what I know will be a positive drug test for something I did legally and wasn‚Äôt aware would jeopardize my anxiety medication. How could I have known when it was never disclosed to me? I did disclose to them about 6 months ago that I occasionally use marijuana (that‚Äôs when I got the card). And what really upsets me is there were no apologies for the delay, their mistake, or accusing me of illegal activity. 

Now I‚Äôm anxious as hell and I don‚Äôt know what to do from here. I don‚Äôt know if they will just stop prescribing abruptly or put me on a drug seeker list somewhere? I don‚Äôt want to be with this doctor after this regardless of what happens. I‚Äôve been borderline panic attack the rest of the day and worried about being without medication. I would have even been okay with an emergency dose because just having it helps me to feel safe, even if I don‚Äôt need to take it. Is there anything I can do? 

When I move on to a different provider, am I going to be labeled a ‚Äúdrug seeker‚Äù forever because of this marijuana? My GAD diagnosis is documented so it‚Äôs not like the legitimacy was a concern. Please help. I‚Äôm panicking."
18y00o1,Anxiety,2024-01-04,Is this normal after a good streak,"Hi, I wanted to ask you about something that has been happening to me lately and I'm worried about the thoughts I'm having.

I have gone through an episode of depression derived from generalized anxiety as a result of having a great hypochondria and fear of the future. (This was in 2022, and the psychiatrist gave me the okay last month after a year with medical  treatment, I‚Äôve been without medication since June)

Lately I have felt again that feeling of derealization that I sometimes felt. I don't feel comfortable with anyone, I feel different, unconcerned, like a third person who really does things for the sake of doing things. And it worries me not to give importance him, in case I am capable of doing some bad thing of ""so little worrying"" I do not speak of committing suicide, that I believe that I would not be capable, but sometimes yes that it comes to my mind to finish with I do not know, and it worries me.

It's been months since I stopped taking antidepressants and I am going to the psychologist monthly. 
Lately it is true that I have had some difficult episodes to deal with and I don't sleep too well. I think that could be a big part of the problem, since I was coming from a very good streak and I was feeling pretty good.

Is the way I've been going lately just a passing episode? It has been sudden and it has hit me hard.

Thank you all for your words"

I developed daily anxiety after my first panic attack about 14 months ago. Some days worse than others, but for the most part, pretty manageable. Not on any meds &amp; don't plan to be unless some drastic change, but I go about my daily life with generalized anxiety &amp; I understand how to control it.

About 4 months ago I started having an upper chest pain, more frequent lately than usual. A little higher than the heart and in the middle of my upper chest, closer to my collarbones. It lasts for about 3 seconds, sharp pain, and either goes away, or it happens a couple more times every minute for a minute or two and then fully goes away till the next time. Usually happens during rest or after eating, usually not during workouts (I weight lift 3-5x a week).

I have a good diet, I'm 6'5, 230 pounds, never happened before I developed anxiety so I want to think it has something to do with that. I'm seeing a cardiologist next week to hopefully cross out any sort of heart problem, but before that I wanted to ask if anyone has had something similar? Any advice is appreciated"

I've been researching mental health for a long time now, espacially anxiety disorders, I have not been diagnosed yet, but I definetely have *something.* I have panick attacks, feeling like I've made a horrible mistake in the past regarding  anything tbh (depedning on my current obssesion), overthinking **all the time.** I feel impending doom, I procrastinate and avoid my triggers like crazy, I can't focus because I keep getting new thoughts about how things will go wrong or how they already are bad enough that there is no point in trying.

 It's honestly ruining my life, especially the last 2 years.

The thing is, I'm scared about medication, I've never been on any anti-anxiety or depression medication and I'm scared the trial and error period will make things worse and that I'll end up avoiding psychiatrists or just mental health care in general. I've noticed that certain lifestyle changes make things better but not better enough to stop looking for other options. **Even when I have a period of a week or two without any crazy meldowns I will still get at least a day when I feel like I'm not myslef, like I'm completely gone and just operating as a anxious sub-personality. - which I'm also not sure is healthy.**

i met with my doctor for the other health related anxiety about a week ago and she drew my blood. i didn't get an mri or ct scan but she said everything checked out normally the only thing is that i have a vitamin d deficiency. i thought that since the main thing i was worried about has been cleared the anxiety would go away. im not sure if the headaches are from anxiety, stress, or the vitamin d deficiency. the headaches are in random places and inconsistent, like over the christmas break (a week &amp; a half) there where a few days where i had no symptoms at all until i thought about them and then they appeared.

18xxq4x,Anxiety,2024-01-03,Anxiety induced cough?,"This thing started around december 2021 when I was about to move to the country that I was living back to my home country. I got checked multiple times and turns out that I wasn't ill and that there was nothing physically wrong with my lungs. I'm a chronic worrier and a very nervous human, so apparently when I'm under higher levels of stress than what I'm used to I start having this dry, persistent and metallic cough that can last up to 3 or 4 months. It interrupts me while talking and doesn't let me sleep, it's even making me embarrased of going out in public. If I experience any remotely strong emotion [negative or positive] while on this condition I go into coughing fits that sometimes make me gag and vomit. Weirdly enough, when I forget about it it goes away, but the minute I remember it comes back to me. The only things I've found that actually help are valium, muscle relaxers and smeling vick's vaporub [though this last one only helps for as long as I keep it under my nose]. I think there might be something wrong in the way that I breathe [couldn't even get that one right lol], my shoulders and neck have always been very tense and I've just noticed that my diaphragm and abdominal muscles are always super tense too. Does anyone experience this as well?"
18xxo2o,Anxiety,2024-01-03,Does anyone get severe stomach upset the day after an overwhelming day?,"Recently I've been getting really bad stomach upset the day after an overwhelming day. My stomach did not used to be so sensitive to this. 

For example yesterday I went out to a foodcourt for lunch with my family and overseas visitors. Then at night they came to my house for dinner. These things are stressful to me and particularly any meal out of home or going shopping makes me very anxious and sometimes I feel panicked. 

Today I am so sick. Stomach pain and diarrhea all morning and still going. I'll probably be in bed most of the day. 

I'm glad I got to do all those things yesterday. I enjoyed it despite the stress. 

Does this happen to anyone else? I've been trying to do more things, get myself out of the house and seeing people. I want to do it. I can handle the feelings of panic when I'm out. But I can't handle the stomach upset the next day. Like how am I meant to get my life back if I get sick everytime I do something? How do I get a job if I keep getting so sick and my stomach won't cooperate? 

I'm actually really worried cos I want to get my life back together and not be stuck at home feeling sick all the time and I want to see people. It's been 4 years."

My girlfriend suffers from a severe case of anxiety over her body image; we're both on our early twenties, none of us have health issues related to weight and we don't have a high BMI, not above our normal rate.

However, due to her extreme case of anxiety, eating disorder and (toxic) parental pressure along her youth to maintain a ""healthy"" way of life (then again, toxic), she constantly battles with herself and her self-esteem. That manifests in the worst ways, further damaging her. I have no idea what to do, as I've never experienced what she goes through, neither have I meet anyone who does.
I try my bestest to be the most understanding person near her, but that doesn't help much to solve her issues.

For those who have been through something similar, is there any way I could be more of assistance to her?

I feel so flipped on my head that it causes me to question my hobbies, job, etc. a lot. Hobbies I can control, but job I struggle more with. For example, I pickedmy job because it piques my anxiety and thus, to my mind, it's attractive for me. It's not too overwhelming (well, I'm still working on reconciling that), but I would say my attitude is a bit rough. It's hard for me to just up and quit a job, though, and I don't have much education to move around.

18xvt8u,Anxiety,2024-01-03,Very slight but constant feeling of worry/ unease/ anxiety?,"

I (f18) sometimes have a day or a couple of days of slight worry/unease. I have had this for years, since a kid. Sometimes it had a cause, like when summer break was about to end or something. 

I have recently lost 30 lbs in the past 6-7 months. I have done it in the healthiest way for me. I am very proud of myself, I am finally happy with how I look. I eat stuff I like, I make my own food but if I am craving something I will adjust my day of eating and be content. Most of the time I am happy with this. But probably every few weeks, for a couple of days in a row, I get this slight sense of worry. I guess the fact that I have to be mindful of my eating gives me a slight second of worry for a second. That thought makes me worried even more. Why am I thinking like this when I am perfectly fine with the way I eat? I know I will have to be disciplined to gain what I want and I am perfectly fine with it. So why this worry? 

I know the obvious answer might seem like my weight loss or diet is the issue, but me experiencing this slight but constant worry has been occurring for since I can remember. The earliest memory of me having this is since the age of maybe 6-7. It happens for a couple of days and then goes away. 

I have posted about this on Reddit from an old account a couple of years back but I don‚Äôt remember getting any replies. Does anyone else experience this? Like I said, it‚Äôs a slight constant feeling but it‚Äôs in the back of my head. Something I think about all day, usually I watch a movie with my family to distract me. Is this normal?"

"
18xvj1l,Anxiety,2024-01-03,Is this Anxiety?,"Hi - I'm hoping someone out there might recognize this story in themselves and be able to point me in some direction.

I have both physical and mental pathways to anxiety like symptoms. The  fundamental symptom is a sense of ""tension"" or ""zing"" in my central nervous system that just won't relent. From reading about the sympathetic/parasympathetic nervous system, I am pretty confident that my body gets locked into a ""fight or flight"" state.

This idea is also supported by my smart watch which rarely says I get a quality sleep (where heart rate variance increases; mine is locked tight). Another bit supporting my theory is that when I do \~10 minutes of deep breathing work, I feel the sensation dissipate, and my digestive system will start making noises, like its relaxing, unclenching, and starting to do its job; this tells me I'm transitioning out of ""fight or flight"". But I can't keep it that way.

This feeling is most problematic at night. I can't get to sleep until I do the breath work, after which I will feel my body relax and I will start to drift off. But the problem is the ""fight or flight"" comes back. I will wake up a couple hours later feeling stress in my system, and repeat the breath / sleep / wake up cycle through the night. In the morning I feel unrested. This ""acute"" problem will last for at least 2 days post exercise before diminishing but never totally goes away. On average, I sleep thru the night but still my smart watch says it was lousy sleep. And I feel wrecked.

The pathways / triggers: mainly, physical exertion. Relatively light exertion causes an over reaction of my heart rate. e.g. walking a stairmaster on a low  setting of 4  (43 steps per minute) producing  a heart rate of 118 (way too high for this effort). Even biking for 20 minutes maintaining a low 100 bpm threshold. Walking a flight of stairs can make me feel out of breath. My heart has become hyper-sensitive to any work load.

Prior to this state, a couple years ago, I was very fit, a cyclist, climbing mountains, heart rate training. Such small amounts of exertion would hardly be noticable. I'm not overweight or on any meds aside from seasonal asthma inhalers in fall/winter.

The other pathway, which doesn't produce as strong a problem, is mental intensity - a couple hours of FPS gaming, or blitz chess, for example, will give me the ""locked"" feeling but not as intensely, not acutely.

When I'm in an ""acute"" phase of problem, which only comes from exercise, other symptoms include a pounding heart, or heart that seems just a bit too strong, and sometimes a slightly tight chest.

I have seen my primary doc, a cardiologist, 3 neurologists, a rheumatologist, and done all kinds of blood tests. Nobody knows what's going, or finds anything.  My numbers are all good. I tested for chorisol / adrenal and they didn't find anything but.. I wasn't acutely symptomatic at the time of test. Would it matter?

Separately, fwiw, I have alopecia, an autoimmune problem, and tinnitus. I have a suspicion all this is related somehow.

As for environment, I don't feel like my life is particularly stressful in any way out of the ordinary, and certainly less stressful than when I was working (now retired). Indeed, I went thru some very stressful things working and in my personal life, so I read about PTSD but it just doesn't seem to quite fit.

I just can't be the only person in the world with this problem and yet none of the docs have any idea. So I'm looking here and everywhere, and appreciate any thoughts.

18xv8fp,Anxiety,2024-01-03,Constant Anxiety,"Question for you all,

So I had a moderate panic attack yesterday morning. 

I‚Äôm pretty sure my heart rate jumped to 120-140bpm

30 minutes later it was down to 100-110

30 minutes after, it stayed steady at 85-100 most of the day.

8:00pm last night it came down to 77 then around 9:00pm it went to 75 and went I went to bed it was 70-72

This morning I woke up and it was 62. I got ready for work, went to the store and it was 75. No big deal but after I got to work it jumped 85-100.

Why is this happening. My heart rate was fine this morning. Is this anxiety? Or is something wrong? If something was wrong wouldn‚Äôt it stay the same even at bedtime.

I‚Äôm at a loss right now and I guess I just need reassurance and advice if this happens or has happened to anyone else"
18xv7rc,Anxiety,2024-01-03,Anxiety about my career and a new job offer,"How to know whether a job offer is good enough?

Hello,

I‚Äôm 23 and I‚Äôve been working as a marketing assistant at a property company for 2 years now. The company had a merger last year, and is set for a takeover of another company this year, so it‚Äôs growing. It‚Äôs my first job out of uni and I currently earn around ¬£25k.

Last year I had severe anxiety attacks due to family issues and my work was suffering. I also have dyspraxia which didn‚Äôt help, and my manager threatened to put me on a performance improvement plan. There was a strong case for workplace discrimination against me too, so I started to look for other jobs.

I had a few job offers back in the summer, one of which was for a competitor for a substantial pay rise, but whenever I‚Äôm offered a job I get this wave of immobilising anxiety and indecisiveness. I eventually missed the deadline to accept the offer and ended up kicking myself afterwards. However, this week I got an informal job offer to work as a marketing coordinator at a prestigious university, for ¬£30,500. It‚Äôs a step up in responsibility from my current role, but I know that I don‚Äôt want to work in higher education long term. Ideally, I‚Äôd want to work in software, tech or automotive.

I have improved at my current job over the last few months, and my manager has told me that if I continue to stay on track, they will begin to teach me what I need to know for a promotion. Despite this, HR have indicated that there won‚Äôt be immediate promotion opportunities until the end of 2024.

I don‚Äôt know what to do, and I don‚Äôt want good opportunities to pass me by and my career progression to stagnate. But, how do I know whether the anxiety that I feel is actually my instinct telling me that something isn‚Äôt right for me? Should I continue to wait for something better to come up in my job search?

Thanks"

One of the most common things that I have is touble sleeping on nights before university and sometimes, I keep waking up an hour or so before my alarm and keep tossing in bed. It is quite annoying because at that point, I'm not even sleeping nor am I fully awake. Other than that, once I'm in uni, I randomly get this feeling where I feel a sort of a heart beat in my stomach (sorry for my poor description but I hope it makes sense) followed by slight dizzines sometimes. Sometimes, I even feel my heart constantly racing and the deep breathing not helping any of it. Now, I think I have anxiety because of two main reasons: one is general anxiety I've always had even as a kid too sometimes nothing too serious and the other one where my mind constantly thinks about my gut issues. I got dengue back in 2019 and after that, I started having these gut issues where I'm constipated quite often and my gut rumnles a lot. Like AUDIBLE RUMBLES. it's so embarrassing to be sitting in a class and my stomach decides to roar. A lot of the times I'm quite gassy and i can literally feel the trapped gas making noises. And it's not just that I'm hungry, these noises happen even when I have taken breakfast. Here's the thing, I do think there is some general imbalance in my gut causing gas and constipation and discomfort but i also think that anxiety somewhat enhances these symptoms. If someone has something similar, please tell me what y'all do to stop these gut issues specially audible stomach rumbles because this is so embarrassing and emotionally taxing too."

The miscommunication involved the new amount minus the old deposit which carried over to this one

Luckily, I was able to spot him turning purple before it was too late. My partner managed to get him breathing again during our 999 call. 

The whole ordeal was very scary and traumatising. As he had to be on oxygen; NG tube for feeding; and a line for antibiotics, and fluids. I had to sit there and watch the doctors try to put the catheter on my son several times in one night which was heartbreaking because of his cries from the pain.  It was confirmed he has RSV which meant we had to stay in the hospital for  a while. 

Yesterday, my partner and I had concerns that my son was showing the sane symptoms for RSV, which resulted to a 111 call and another ambulance ride to A&amp;E. 

Until yesterday I never really fully realised how much the the whole thing  had affected me. As soon as 111 told us an ambulance was on its way I felt so nauseous  and once I got in the ambulance and hospital I felt sick.  Even though my son has one of those breathing monitors I am still too scared to sleep. I constantly check my son if he is still breathing and too scared to drive in case he stops breathing and I don't notice it.

Since then, I have had a wide range of mostly physical symptoms. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs PTSD because I‚Äôve never really had flash backs and I don‚Äôt even think about the actual event much at all. I‚Äôve even gone for massage therapy since then (a woman and a different location, of course) and it didn‚Äôt trigger my anxiety at all- though I was worried it would!

- heartburn
- constant thoughts and fears of death for myself and my loved ones
- awful eczema outbreaks on my hands
- tons of neck tension and tension headaches

18xsu0z,Anxiety,2024-01-03,Is this a backwards step? Opinions please,"So I've suffered with panic disorder and agoraphobia for 20+ years. Over this time I've had periods where I'm quite good, able to drive places on my own etc, but for the most part I rely heavily on my family for help with doing many things.  
My main issue is that if I'm too far from the car or out in a wide space my legs turn to jelly and I have trouble breathing. It then turns into a full blown panic attack because I feel like I can't get back to the safety of the car.  
About a year ago I started getting vertigo from loose crystals in my ear.. although I was treated for this I continued feeling floaty on my feet for some time so we bought a cheap wheelchair for me to use around the house so it was easier to get to the bathroom etc. I've used it a couple of times on dizzy days.  
During my first major dizzy spell my husband took me for a walk around the block (in the chair) and I was surprised to not have any anxious feelings. I felt safe and enjoyed my surroundings outside for the first time in years. Amazed by this new found freedom we bought a scooter (like the kind folk use around town lime etc) and we started driving it to the park so I could scoot around.. I can scoot to the other side of the park, which is quite big .. it is thrilling. I still can't walk from my house without getting jelly legs and headspins, so I don't feel like I've actually made progress, but I have found something that brings me some joy and a sense of freedom.  
Now the reason I'm here is this.. my husband and I have booked a trip of a lifetime to the UK and I am understandably pretty nervous about getting around. I want to be brave and do most things under my own steam because the car won't be too far away.. but there are a couple of places where the walk from the car is a bit of a distance... paved but far. (Stonehenge, Culloden) do I take my wheelchair (it's lightweight) so I can enjoy these things rather than waiting in the car and missing out. Or is it a step too far.  
I have a psychologist and I know he would tell me I don't need it but the reality is I would likely miss out if I try to just convince myself I'll be ok.  
What would you do?"

18xsh63,Anxiety,2024-01-03,Online Gaming Induced Anxiety,"I (32f) was diagnosed with GAD and social anxiety in 2008. 

I'm not anxious about playing the games online. It's when I play sometimes that I get the anxiety. 

When I was high school, my ex-boyfriend taught me how to play COD: Modern Warfare II (2009 version), which led me to playing with him and my cousin with COD: Black ops. That was great, had a bunch of fun and would always do well, and never had any anxiety playing. 

(At this point, I should say that I was on 100 mg of Zoloft from 2008-2011, it never seemed like it was doing anything.)

Over the course of the next couple years, I started getting anxiety whenever I would be in game, either from shooting the other team or being shot at. (Don't get me wrong, I can play FIFA and feel like I'm a little anxious, but nothing like playing a shooter.)

So, I stopped playing COD online for 6 or 7 years. Two weeks ago, I started playing Fortnite with my siblings, and everything was fine. I wasn't feeling anxious while we did duos or trios. Then I tried some solos and I thought I was fine until I was eliminated. My heart started racing, my hands were shaking, my face got flushed and just felt so entirely overwhelmed. I played a couple matches solo, and it was ONLY when I was eliminated that I became this way.

It's clear to me now that my medication might have been the reason I wasn't anxious playing years ago. I just don't understand how I'd be perfectly fine, mostly anxiety free when playing with a couple others, and then have such anxiety going at it alone. 

It's such a little thing to complain about, but gaming has always been a way I mitigate the stress and anxieties I may have on a daily basis. It makes me feel like I subconsciously need someone else to make sure I'm not getting anxious, and I don't want to be relying on others to avoid anxiety, let alone play a video game. "
18xscs8,Anxiety,2024-01-03,27F Struggling but wanting change,"I am your stereotypical first born Asian daughter (1st generation American).    I have been struggling with anxiety and probably some form of depression for a long time.  It's been progressively much much worse this holiday season as I've been dreading this increase in responsibilities at work.  That although I am highly functioning there- it's been wreaking havoc on my body.  I've never had a significant other- I have control issues because I can't trust anyone enough not to hurt me or use me. 

My bedroom is a mess and it's hard to workup the energy to clean or even take care of myself properly.  I desperately want to change but I'm scared of therapy and meds.  I wouldn't know what to say to a therapist.  I tend to manipulate my narritive when speaking to others about my problems. I'm afraid that the meds will ruin my functionality.  And there in lies the added issues of me making excuses for everyone and everything.  

I guess I'm just looking for some advice, maybe a little bit of a push, and some grounding into reality."

It‚Äôs been a really bad couple of days, but I‚Äôve been noticing also a feeling that‚Äôs more similar to excitement? I may just be feeling this because I used to attribute indigestion to happiness due to substance use, but I get this weird butterfly feeling. Idk how to make sense of it. It‚Äôs still bad and I‚Äôm still very nervous, but it‚Äôs like, the feeling you get before a first date.

Idk why though because there‚Äôs nothing I feel this way about in my life. I‚Äôm a woman who is ovulating so could that be it? My arms have been tingling and got an abnormal EKG at urgent care.

18xqj6d,Anxiety,2024-01-03,Question to Males with an anxiety disorder?,"Greetings, everyone. To keep it brief, I was chatting with a male acquaintance of mine who shared a belief that confused me. He stated that he thinks his anxiety disorder prevents him from being attractive to women in general.

During our conversations, he shared a few examples to illustrate his point. He believed that he wouldn't get approached by women at parties, but the same was not true for work events or social gatherings - there, women barely acknowledged him and did not attempt to strike up a conversation or make any comments.

His usual routine involves putting in a lot of time and effort to meet women online, but after their first meeting, he never hears from them again

His dating history reveals a pattern of only lasting three dates with any woman before she disappears from his life, if he's lucky enough to even make it that far.

He believes that his anxiety could be causing him to experience symptoms like premature ejaculation, even though he doesn't necessarily have a diagnosed condition. He struggles to perform well in bed, with his maximum time being under 5 minutes or sometimes even just 3 minutes.

I'm curious if other men have gone through a similar experience. If so, how did it affect you and how did you overcome it?

18xq7r6,Anxiety,2024-01-03,"I've got no-one, 18m","I took a gap year, I got the grades to get in but I couldn't find anywhere cheap to live for uni, so very last minute I decided to spend a year working. What I didn't realise though is that it'd mean I'd meet no new people, I only had the people i already had, and even then the majority of them went to uni far away too. I just had two left that I talked to at all. I've never felt like we were best friends (I've always been reminded by them that they are already best friends so I can't be) but we did lots together, we'd go out, go on trips that kinda thing. Although they've always been closer, they have a sleepover once a week together, work at the same place, everything, whereas I would be lucky to meet them more than once a month. As one of them was going to a uni close by they asked me for help at the start of term with how to get the train there, so I helped we did a practice trip there together just us two and started talking a lot more, it got to the point where everyday we were talking from when we woke up to when we went to sleep, a couple times we went out just us two too (of course we could never tell the other one we were doing that as we couldn't leave them out like they left me out a lot). Me and them talked about their problems too, I helped them open up more and get help, and was always told that I can always talk to them about anything. Occasionally the third would find out how much we were both talking without them, they made it out to be such a big deal that we were leaving them out of our conversations, how they thought they were being replaced. But a month ago it all kinda changed, just one day (happened to be a day I first told them I was not doing that well mentally that day) they kinda just went really dry and stopped talking to me, the only time they did talk to me was if it was about their interest, and even then it was only twice, everytime I tried to talk to them it made me feel like they didn't want to talk to me anymore, I was always the one to send the last message. We haven't messaged in over a month now, the only time we talk is in a groupchat with all three of us, and even then it's awkward. I had paid for a trip for all of us and it took them basically 2 months to pay me back (all the while them telling me how they're getting paid from work) I mentioned it to them and they just brushed it off. Most of the things we do are things those two want to go do, see their concerts, see their films, go shopping for them, I go along because I like seeing them, I said last week I wanted to see them today, I didn't know what to do though, I even thought just us sitting together and talking might be nice, but a couple days later they message saying they have both got what they want to do and I'm coming with them, and then they say it's a romance film with many sex scenes in it, not my thing at all. I say I'll go but then on the day I just really don't want to, we'd gone to a film before together and they really made me seem like I wasn't enjoying it or anything, I was left to be the one on my own, I back out of this one then get asked if I wanted to drive them to a shop to get something to say hi at least, but the thing that got me is I'd be dropping them both back at one of theirs for them to spend the night together, what a way to tell me they don't want to see me. I've always been more a person to become friends with women, and as a man I thought that I was always left out of coming round, or staying the night together because I was a man, but idk, I'm increasingly being left out of even having an evening together, and I don't have anyone else to talk to. Idk if they used me to help them get to uni in the first couple months, I always plan anything we do, the concerts were going to see I booked them all, I planned them all, I am the one that drives. There have been times when they are sleeping over and they call me because they need help fixing their laptop to watch a movie together. Idk what to do, I've not even got a message from either of them to ask if I'm okay, all I'll see is that they are both active and talking to each other, I'm always left out.

I‚Äôve had a CT scan of my brain, getting an MRI next week, currently wearing a heart monitor for a few days, starting physical therapy, been on 10mg Lexapro for 3 months (doesn‚Äôt seem to be working). The doctors say I‚Äôm fine‚Äî I just have anxiety, maybe some benign vertigo from who knows what. But then I‚Äôll have something like elevated RBC show up on my blood work, which google of course says is some rare type of cancer, even though it can be caused my dehydration, anxiety, benign genetic factors, etc. And then since I constantly feel so crummy, I assume it must be because of an underlying condition, rather than anxiety. I‚Äôll never be appeased. No amount of reassurance will ever reassure me that I‚Äôm actually fine. I‚Äôll just find something else to fixate on.

I‚Äôve been described as a mermaid but am now terrified of drowning and undertow so I‚Äôve stopped swimming.

I have anxiety and depression for 6 years now. (21M)

Now Im Feeling like my nervous system is ""FRIED""
What the Fu*k is this? I feel STUCK! 

Symptoms I have:anhedonia, cant focus and concentrate, Im here but not here,life seems like a bad dream all the time, everything looks fake,night feels more empty and darker,cant feel ahappiness ""inside me"", even my emotions feels so fake...its hard to describe. 
I can only feel anger inside of me...I just wanna live.

Im 101% sure it is a brain damage...I didbCT scan, blood test, EEG, almost everything and everything was clear. But still thinking its a brain damage.

I got prescribed Seroxat(Paroxetine) and Xanax

Seroxat didnt help at all which is REALLY REALLY weird.
Xanax helped (for headaches) only.

It‚Äôs like I can talk normal at home but in school my voice becomes so much more quiet especially in this one class when I try to answer a question. My brain cannot even focus on questions most of the time because I feel like I have to be alert of everything happening because of my anxiety, and I feel like I am trying to compete with people who just yell out the answers so my brain is working overtime to get the answer as quick as possible and it turns out to be wrong.

I‚Äôve been getting stress rashes and headaches because of this (and I have semi important exams coming up) and I have horrible sleep anxiety, I know I am anxious because of school but it is so much easier to blame my headaches on the fact that I only got six hours of sleep last night, or the reason I shouldn‚Äôt try to answer questions in class or talk to other people is because I didn‚Äôt sleep well last night so I don‚Äôt have the energy for the effort, or some excuse like that.

I am someone who has had social anxiety my whole life as well as Hypothyroidism. My thyroid issue has generally been good through my life as I am carefully monitored with blood tests. Recently, My thyroid levels have shot up to high after taking 200mg of Levothyroxine for 3 months following my pharmacy‚Äôs advice. Now they want to bring it down to 75mg. Most of my life I‚Äôve been taking 75mg to 100mg of Levothyroxine so I felt it was quite odd to be told to start 200mg.

Anxiety: This is bothering me the most. My anxiety has shot through the roof in the last week so much so I had to go to the Emergency room. They checked my blood pressure and confirmed it was high. They did an ECG but never gave me the results or didn‚Äôt feel the need to. All that doctor said was he thinks it‚Äôs my high thyroid levels and the sudden and dramatic change in Levothyroxine dose. He ended it saying he is not going to give me anything and that I‚Äôm going to have to wait it out out for a few weeks. My family doctor did a blood test just before all of this happened and confirmed my thyroid levels are high. Thus, she told me to take 75mg Levothyroxine rather than 200mg (I was taking 200 for the last 2-3 months) and that she will do another blood test to monitor levels. It is like I have someone else‚Äôs brain - I am getting very strange intrusive thoughts about suicide and calling myself a loser for living with my parents at 30. Before, I never thought about suicide or cared whether I am 30 and living with parents. I am thinking about how I haven‚Äôt saved up properly and that my life is over. Because of this anxiety, I am reading constant Reddit posts and YouTube videos about if I should worry about living with parents or not and I do see alot saying things like, ‚ÄúIf I was living with my parents at 32 I would commit suicide‚Äù or ‚ÄúIf you are living with your parents in your 30s you are a life failure‚Äù and I even forced myself to watch a video of Jimmy Kimmel putting down someone for living with their parents. 

Vision: My vision goes blurry (noticed when I am working) and that in turn is making it harder for me to focus or care about my work.

Tired/Insomnia: I am feeling very tired all the time. That said, I am not sleeping very well at all. In fact, I probably got 4-5 hours of sleep in the last two nights. 

Confusion: I occasionally feel disorientated and confused as if I‚Äôm living in a simulation. It is a very strange and unpleasant feeling. 

I feel like a junkie. I am constantly worrying about every single thing. How I envy older people because they are going to die sooner than me. I was on Xanax and Risperidone before and I was not thinking the way I am now. I want/am coming off all anxiety medication because I don‚Äôt want to keep taking them. It‚Äôs confusing what is causing my extreme levels of anxiety if it‚Äôs withdrawal from the two medicines or it‚Äôs because of Hyperthyroidism or the sudden significant change in Levothyroxine levels. 

Please any assistance would be much appreciated because I am genuinely crying inside. I don‚Äôt feel myself at all. I love my parents and brother a lot and they love me and have done everything for me and so I feel guilty feeling like this. I want to continue living with them because I am just happy with the support network. I don‚Äôt have hardly any friends and so living alone would really impact my mental health. I‚Äôm just torturing myself reading those Reddit posts or watching those YouTube videos because it just makes the problem worse.

How long will it take for my Hyperthyroidism to subside to normal? I have been taking 75mg for almost a week now."
18xojtz,Anxiety,2024-01-03,How do you cope with anxiety nausea?,"I feel nauseous every single day and my stomach can barely handle food anymore and i can always feel my gag reflex wanting to go off constantly and its really ruining my social life, everything i do is about accomodating for my nausea which limits almost everything and it only seems to get worse for no reason, making my depression worse too 

Is there something that can be done or is this just how it is for me now?

18xofh8,Anxiety,2024-01-03,Things to improve on - tips and thoughts are welcome,"
Hi.  
I suffer from health anxiety and it affects my life quite a bit. I don‚Äôt really suffer from anything else anxiety related (no problem with crowds, people or going out). As for many other, thoughts and ‚Äúphysical‚Äù symptoms spark quite a bit of them. What I hope from ranting about some of my thoughts is to hear other people‚Äôs thoughts or tips (maybe you have encountered same and did / did not do anything special to improve upon them). 

I‚Äôm bad at eating and have been for some years. It‚Äôs been pretty bad the last year or so. I don‚Äôt know much about dieting at all. I tried calorie counting and it was hard for me to even hit 2200 kcal, normally 1800-1900, but I should be around 2500-2600 for my size. 
I have an idea it affects my blood sugar quite substantially and therefore my mood and energy levels. 

My HA says stomach issues over and over again and I want to think it‚Äôs just HA. I often encounter discomfort, bloating and changing bowel movements. Some nights i can‚Äôt sleep because of them hurting - maybe correlated to my bad dieting. 
Maybe it‚Äôs just HA all along and I want to believe that. I really do, but there is / must be things I can do to maybe lessen the symptoms (other than medication and therapy). Most of the things I think about, I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs even any good or ‚Äúworth it‚Äù, but also what to do precisely. Some things I am so clueless about and have no idea where to start.

Exercising for example is not optimal. I don‚Äôt do much other than grocery shopping here and there. I once cycled, but now with HA and bad diet it‚Äôs hard to be energised well enough. 

There also comes really bad posture and neck pain. Maybe these introduces new symptoms for me. I suffer quite a lot from brain fog and the feeling of ‚Äúabout to collapse‚Äù. Some days is better than others, but they usually come up regardless. It‚Äôs annoying because you feel like you have 0 brain activity in there and it‚Äôs about to shut down. I know it isn‚Äôt, but I question wether it‚Äôs anxiety related or my bad diet, posture / neck pain, exercise or I‚Äôm sitting too much still. (I‚Äôve been ‚Äúsick‚Äù from school 2-3 months now and I‚Äôve not done much). I do want to improve on just some of these things. I just don‚Äôt know how or where to start. 

Sorry for the long text. I wanted to write most of my thoughts about what may else be worsing / fueling my health anxiety.

Thanks for reading &lt;3."
18xo9gb,Anxiety,2024-01-03,will quitting drinking help get rid of my physical anxiety symptoms?,"hi i (21 m) recently developed anxiety, and even with therapy and medication i still find myself struggling every so often with soreness in my chest during times of being anxious. it's not life altering or rarely does it even affect my day to day but it is something i would like to get rid of. i have a few drinks a week, rarely ever get drunk but i've always enjoyed a good buzz and never noticed an increase of my general anxiety around the days i do drink. i've read a lot on this sub reddit how quitting drinking was  a game changer but i'm just curious if it could help with the physical symptoms. my mind is already able to recognize anxiety and calm down pretty quickly but my body doesn't seem to follow unless i'm completely preoccupied with something. i've also been to the doctor for multiple times since my diagnosis to make sure there are no underlying health issues and everytime i have been told i'm very healthy. i know it sounds stupid, but i don't want to just quit something i enjoy doing with my friends if it really isn't going to do anything."
18xo99b,Anxiety,2024-01-03,"I need opinions on my symptoms (dizzy, lightheadness, can't focus)","Hello everyone,  
I'm writing this post because I've been suffering from considerable anxiety every day for almost 2 years now, and my physical symptoms have changed quite a bit in 2 years, which has created real health anxiety for me. And despite several blood tests, 2-3 trips to the doctor who tells me he doesn't see anything strange (I haven't done any tests at a cardiologist's, although I plan to), I can't believe that my symptoms are only due to anxiety and not to a real illness or health problem. 

  
Here are my symptoms:  
Dizziness (the biggest), confusion, lightheadness, feeling of seeing differently, weakness, brain fog, feeling like i can't focus with my eyes, and sometimes I really feel like I'm fainting (although I've never fainted).

  
Sometimes it happens when I'm exerting myself, but sometimes it just happens when I'm sitting down. The times when it happens to me most is when I leave home and have to get to an activity (a party, a date etc.). Overall, whenever I see friends, for the first 10 minutes I don't feel well, like I'm going to faint (even if I hide it from them), but almost all the time I manage to get better (and alcohol helps a lot too... unfortunately).  
I hardly ever do sport any more, but when I do it on my own I have the same symptoms, but recently I did a muscle-building session with my brother, and if at the beginning I had trouble, the rest went well.  
Sometimes these symptoms are more minor, sometimes they are so strong that I cancel outings... Every time they happen, I'm terrified, as if I'm going to die, as if my heart is going to give out.   
Everything suggests that it's just anxiety, but I just can't believe it, my symptoms seem too present and powerful to be just anxiety...  
I'm writing this to find out how you feel about my situation, and if other people have similar experiences, to tell me what they've done to help this, how they've overcome these symptoms...  
Thank you very much to those who took the time to read, and have a happy new year 2024.

18xo4vo,Anxiety,2024-01-03,Wife suffering from sever post partum,"Good Afternoon, as i said my wife had our baby in mid november. everything seemed fine in the hospital but when we got home she started experiencing severe anxiety and insomnia on top of caring for our two children. We have great support from family offering to watch kids or stay with her when i am at work. OBGYN started her on Zoloft 25mg to no effect. one day about a week in they told her to go to the ER where she was given ativan to help her sleep. about 2 weeks of 25mg did nothing so she was upped to 50mg zoloft and then 100mg a week later. she has some moments that are better than ever but for the most part she is having a very hard time dealing with everything. she occasionally takes an ativan to help her get a few hours sleep but she does not want to rely on drugs to get rest.Now after 6 weeks of varying doses of zoloft she does not feel it is making a difference, possibly even worse.

I do not suffer from anykind of anxiety or mental health issues so at times it is hard to understand but i do y best to support her. I am a fan of doing everything as natural as possible. I ordered Sugar Bears Sleep blend that should arrive today. I have also heard CBD is helpful. 

I am interested in hearing from others who are going through this, have conquered it, or from those in the same position as me supporting a loved one through something they cant relate to. thank you all"

The most annoying way in which it manifests itself is that I have a hard time looking at screens. Sadly I work on a computer.

During my previous episode I discovered a small trick to decrease it which was working behind a standing desk. No idea how it works but it slightly decreases the sensory overstimulation so my nervous system winds up slower.

But still it's really tiring. I have to do guided meditations after every 2 hours of work to decompress. I have constant tinnitus, my jaw is clenching.

18xm5i4,Anxiety,2024-01-03,A Had A Really Bizarre Panic Attack While Playing A Video Game With Friends. I'm Humiliated.,"I honestly don't know why I do this, but it isn't the first time. I don't know why this happened; I don't know if it's anxiety, trauma, autism, a mix of all three, but it was so awful and humiliating and I hate myself for it. 

My group of friends dragged me to play Minecraft last night, a game I don't normally play but I figured I'd give it a shot just for them. I don't dislike the game or anything, it was just never my cup of tea. Despite that though, I played a game mode with them. It was cute. It was like a super hero game mode. 

There was one point however where something just really bad happened. There was a certain way to fly your character and everyone else was able to do it no problem, but when I did it, I kept crashing and dying. Like, I just couldn't figure it out at all; no matter what they said I just kept crashing. The first time I crashed my friend laughed, and that's when it started. 

My body started becoming tense and numb, I couldn't speak and I couldn't move. My heart was pounding out of my chest and everyone was there and the one person was trying to teach me how to do it and I was just sitting there unable to react. I felt so much pressure and I felt like I was never gonna get it right and that I was just humiliating myself in front of everyone. 

I suddenly just dipped the game and because I was host it stopped. I can remember everyone was super quiet when I left. They asked me if I was okay and I told them I needed a few minutes. It was humiliating and so degrading. I felt like a complete idiot. My love interest was there and the fact that he saw that too made it so much worse.

Afterwords, in a few minutes I did calm down. I apologized to all of them and they were completely understanding. Still, it didn't stop me from feeling really really embarrassed. Has anybody else ever dealt with this before? I don't know why I do it, but it wasn't the first time. It's happened before. I just crack under pressure so fast and I just freeze unable to do anything. 

I'll be telling my therapist about it tomorrow but I wanted to just spill it somewhere because it's been heavily bothering me."
18xlvv7,Anxiety,2024-01-03,"(F23) No matter what I do, the anxiety never goes away...","I have had anxiety, more specifically social anxiety since I was a kid. Always have had a very low self-esteem, no confidence, etc. Always struggled meeting people, connecting with others my age, etc.

I'm not on medication for it &amp; am unableto even get some. There have been times where I've been able to get a grip on it. But lately it's just getting worse. I'm in college now and starting a new job and my social anxiety is just paralyzing - I feel like I can't think clearly, panicked, stuck, major headache, everything! And I often feel all this within social interactions too, which I often can't even talk in front of my peers! It's awful and I end up feeling more stupid. 

I just don't know why it won't go away, no one else seems to understand. I practice self-care, being mindful, try to have a good lifestyle and mentally work through it, but nothing helps anymore. I am like a deer in headlights and then feel like my heart will stop or my head will explode with the panic. 

How can I stop being so anxious and panicked with people??? I feel like I don't even know myself. When I get up to talk or even present in front of others - I feel transparent. Like they see right through me. It's just wearing on me a lot now and I feel stuck."

On top of this, the hours I work make it difficult for me to have a social life (working late and shift schedule). As a people-person this has also made my anxiety worse and energy lower. 

Last night, my anxiety was so bad I couldn't sleep.  I get really anxious calling out but I just didnt feel well enough to do my job properly (for reference this is the second time ive called out in 6 months). I think the chief thought I wasnt really sick and was just trying to get an excuse to get out of work. When I called again as she told me to do, to let them know I was feeling better, the night chief scolded me about not calling earlier. 

My anxiety has been so bad I felt like a break was needed to help make it better, but instead, I think it made it worse. I was so anxious the whole day and still am that my coworkers don't take me seriously anymore and are mad at me for calling in sick.

So I have a weird fear of fainting and lately I feel like it‚Äôs taking over my life. I think it stems from my fears of not having control and my fear of uncontrollable anxiety. I‚Äôm scared of fainting, but I‚Äôm also scared I‚Äôll wake up and feel disoriented, or out of control or completely freaked out.

I‚Äôve been obsessing over it to the point where I‚Äôll be feeling lightheaded, which leads to a massive panic attack which ultimately makes things worse. I‚Äôve now had to leave work early twice because I was so freaked out and felt like I was floating/lightheaded and couldn‚Äôt function.

I‚Äôm so frustrated with this fear. Does anyone else experience it? And how do you manage these fears/feelings? Thanks in advance :)"

It was the worst experience I ever felt in my entire life, I was catching my breath and felt so small and my entire body was numb I was also pale. During those moment I was already thinking of ‚Äúwould i d**??‚Äù ‚Äú can I make it to the hospital?‚Äù which I did. I was there for 3 days and got my potassium back to normal however, when i got back home my anxiety started i thought it was normal because I was just discharged from the hospital. I was thinking of would it happen again or does something new might happen to me. It was always present everyday, i felt the same numbness during my attacks, my hands and feet was always cold and felt like i need to puke or need to go to the bathroom. Until i decided to talk to a counselor/therapist to help me because it was really affecting my day to day i dont want to move so much or do something because I am afraid it might happen again. Also  it got worst because I used to google symptoms that my body feels and we all know google has all answers and it makes you want to believe that you also have that kind of sickness. Im about to start my 3rd session of therapy and i still do felt anxious sometimes. I feel like i have been avoiding it and the more I avoid my anxiety increases. I can‚Äôt stop my mind thinking of negative thoughts. I have been doing journal and trying to change my negative thoughts to a positive one. I have been reading a lot about anxiety so I can learn and know what to do.

18xh5cw,Anxiety,2024-01-03,Why did I suddenly get anxiety attacks while doing something that's never been a problem?,"I went out skiing with my dad today, same as we always did. Last year we went skiing a ton and it was really fun and there was never any problem.

Today though, as soon as I got on the chairlift I got something what I can only assume was an anxiety attack (I never got something like that). I was breathing heavily, clapping my limbs together and was just really afraid for some reason. It's like I was afraid that the lift would crash, and I just wanted to get out of there. My dad was able to calm me down somewhat and nothing bad happened.

Now I'm afraid that if I go on the chairlift again I'll have a similar experience and maybe do something stupid like jump out. I don't understand why this happened, it makes no sense. Maybe it's because I'm mentally in a worse spot than I was previously? I've been trying to get out of my shell and socialize more, which has definitely made me more anxious, but I don't get why that would suddenly make me afraid of chairlifts."

It kind of feels like I‚Äôm having a ‚Äústroke‚Äù or ‚Äúseizure,‚Äù or what my anxiety thinks a stroke or seizure is like. It‚Äôs feels like I‚Äôm about to fall asleep, or maybe i‚Äôm already entering my sleep cycle, but then the anxiety jolts me awake and my body is still in sleep mode so it leaves my brain being active while my body is still half conscious.

As part of my course, I am required to conduct and submit case studies.  When conducting a case study, I will be putting into practice techniques I have learnt on the course.
I would love to work with the people of this community hence I am looking for a volunteer who would like to make some changes in their lives in the areas mentioned above, and benefit from learning some techniques. 
I need to run these case studies on the basis of one session a week or so. The first session will last about 90 minutes followed by 5 sessions of 1 hour according to your specific case (more if needed). All sessions will be done online using Teams (you only need a phone or computer with a camera + and a quiet spot in your place).
I will assess suitability once you get in touch, and I will send you a few documents to fill out (won‚Äôt take too long) so I can better prepare for the work we will be doing together. Amongst these will be a ‚Äúcase study agreement‚Äù which will give you more details about the therapy process.

 However, a week or so ago I experienced a panic attack. It felt like nothing was real and I was beyond scared.

The days after that panic attack, I began to worry about my health as my arms started tingling when I would wake up or go to sleep. I started let it affect me so much I completely lost my appetite.

I'd like to note that my goal is to gain muscle, and not having an appetite made me more stressed out because I wasn't eating. 

Anyways it became so bad I went to the ER and they prescribed me with medication for Anxiety. Which I'm not surprised cause I know I've had anxiety my whole life however I've never had anxiety or a panic attack until now.id also like to note that my dad had anxiety with his health when he was in his 20's as well. 

Today however, I went to my doctor and he doctor said everything looks fine and I'm young and healthy, he did say he wants to check my thyroid. I'm really anxious about this. I never been to the Er or a hospital before my visit. I've always been healthy, the only thing I have is anemia and that was cause of my poor appetite before leading up to the panic attack. I also have issues sleeping now, which I have never had, making me think it's my thyroid after googling things and reading things on Reddit

. Has anyone ever experienced this? Can anyone give me tips on how to overcome this?"

However the service I'm using is kind of lousy from my experience (which is a given considering it's only ¬£40-50). Last time I used it was solely for anxiety and all he basically did was just prescribe me propranolol and that was it, I was too anxious to properly advocate for myself. So this time around I want to make sure I am asking for the right stuff.

I plan on going into the appointment and telling the doctor that I have two interlinked issues; anxiety and alcoholism. I will specify that I want to completely quit alcohol and therefore am interested in diazepam (which I've read is helpful for combatting withdrawal), I then will tell the doctor that I need something long term for my anxiety that isn't just beta blockers as I find them only to be a bandaid and that sorting my anxiety is fundamental for me ending my alcoholism. However I am not really sure what I should ask for which is why I'm on here.

I have been reading about SSRIs which the NHS website says is what a GP would usually recommend but I'm not sure which will suit me best, nor am I sure about the requirements to get prescribed them (they can't really test my blood over the phone if that's required).

Could anyone give me any advice that will help me properly advocate for myself during this appointment? literally any advice is appreciated!"
18xe9c3,Anxiety,2024-01-03,Shortness of Breath related to Anxiety?,"Hello everyone,

since November 2021 I have Long Covid, before that time I was perfectly healthy. For the first half year I had breathing issues that faded. One year after that, in June 2023, the breathing issues came back suddenly. I was driving my car and from one second to another I had the feeling that I couldnt breath anymore. So I thought it will go away again like last time, but it didnt. I had a gastroscopy and have GERD and a small hertial hernia, I had a heart MRI and had some inflammation, but very little (the dr. said that cant be the reason) and small vessel issues but only with stress. The thing is, the breathing issues are also present when I am not walking or having a high heart rate. Its there 24/7.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, that could explain parts of the issue BUT: When I wake up, the first 2-3 minutes my breathing is perfectly fine. Also Ativan and Alcohol makes it better (doesnt go away but its tolerable then). 

&amp;#x200B;

I dont feel the Anxiety in my brain, i feel like its only in my body. As I already do meditation and breath exercises, I dont know what else to do. I am trying an SSRI now but those didnt work in the past. I am also fasting and trying to get rid of my GERD which is hard as i am not feeling heartburn. Maybe you guys have an idea what I can still do to make it better. I cant exercise due to my heart and the breathing issues anymore but I do around 10k steps a day. I cant work anymore as sitting makes it worse. I am basically laying around the entire day or walking around trying to breath. Its crazy. 

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you guys and have a great new year!"

I have recently lost 30 lbs in the past 6-7 months. I have done it in the healthiest way for me. I am very proud of myself, I am finally happy with how I look. I eat stuff I like, I make my own food but if I am craving something I will adjust my day of eating and be content. Most of the time I am happy with this. But probably every few weeks, for a couple of days in a row, I get this slight sense of worry. I guess the fact that I have to be mindful of my eating gives me a slight second of worry for a second. That thought makes me worried even more. Why am I thinking like this when I am perfectly fine with the way I eat? I know I will have to be disciplined to gain what I want and I am perfectly fine with it. So why this worry? 

I know the obvious answer might seem like my weight loss or diet is the issue, but me experiencing this slight but constant worry has been occurring for since I can remember. The earliest memory of me having this is since the age of maybe 6-7. It happens for a couple of days and then goes away. 

I have posted about this on Reddit from an old account a couple of years back but I don‚Äôt remember getting any replies. Does anyone else experience this?

It's been a huge part of most of my life for so long now that I genuinely cannot remember what I used to be like without it.

I remember used to going out and doing/trying more things when I was younger but I don't remember the feelings of it. I haven't been on meds, have been to therapy but my anxiety isn't serious enough to prevent me from leaving the house though it's still definitely there in my mind everyday. 

It's feels like something that because it's been with you for so long, it becomes a huge part of you too."

191n1m7,Anxiety,2024-01-08,Anxiety is beating me.,"Hi everyone :)

I doubted if I should tell this story in OCD or anxiety community but I feel like this community will understand my symptoms and thought process a little better.

In 2021, I was a relatively normal person, I had occasional anxiety but it was always manageable and nothing that ruled my life or anything even CLOSE to that. In summer of 2021, I drank a very large amount of coffee (I know it‚Äôs not as ‚Äúcrazy‚Äù as some serious drugs but well‚Ä¶it did its trick on me) and at night I started shaking &amp; twiching.
I immediately thought that it was a seizure or something like that and ever since, I developed an ongoing fear that I was epileptic (spoiler alert: I am not)

Long story short, I had that fear from 2021 to winter 2023. A week ago, that fear kind of faded away even though it was a part of my everyday life and at some point even ruled it.

Well, immediately after that fear died down, I read somewhere that anxiety and ocd (which I suspect I have) can lead to guess what?-psychosis and schizophrenia.

So me being me, I immediately knew this would become my new obsession. Now, for over a week now, I‚Äôve been googling symptoms of schizophrenia/ psychosis, applying it to myself.
That also made me experience dpdr pretty heavily (It always gets triggered when my anxiety is high)

I know that this is not even somewhat normal way to live so I booked an appointment with a psychologist but before I get an official diagnosis I wanted to ask people on reddit 

1) have you ever experienced something similiar?

2) does this look like schizophrenia to you?

3) does it ever get better‚Ä¶?

Thank you!"

I didn‚Äôt think it was possible to live without anxiety and a taste of it is too good to let go. I‚Äôm sure that this doesn‚Äôt work for everyone, but just wanted to share my story.

I'm a functional adult (teacher lol) and support my family financially. But yes, I'm a degenerate.

Something traumatic happened October 2022 which caused my anxiety. I noticed I no longer do recreational drugs just for fun. Iy is a form of escapism. I do it more often and in larger quantities than ever. When the first sip of alcohol enters my body, I know my purpose is to get incredibly fucked up so I don't have to deal with the reality of the present. I'll spend the next 12 hours on a diet of nothing but alcohol, cocaine and xanax. I've wasted so many weekends like this. 

I'm trapped in a vicious cycle of being anxious, abusing substances to rid of those feelings, and the comedown fuelling my anxiety. How many times have I said ""I'm not drinking anymore"" just for the same shit to repeat itself the following weekend? 

I cannot afford to fuck up my life - I have a younger brother who is autistic and requires full-time care, and a mentally unwell mother. I've got a postgrad offer from one of London's most prestigious universities, it's my key to giving my family the life they deserve. I can't go to this programme fucked up.

190s3oa,Anxiety,2024-01-07,Seeking Feedback on Medical Community Acceptance of Long Term Benzo Usage,"I have had anxiety issues for 38 years, and for much of that time I have been prescribed either alprazolam or lorazepam.  Both have been very effective in handling my anxiety, by ramping me down as a panic attack begins / accelerates.  For the last decade I have been prescribed 1mg lorazepam, and am given a 90 day supply.   Never in that time have I taken more than the prescription.  Never in 38 years on benzos have I increased my dosage.  In my opinion, benzos have worked wonders for me, and I wish to continue to have access to them.

Recently my doctor has removed my access to lorazepam, citing unspecified studies of harmful long term usage.  I have been like a zombie for the last month, barely able to leave the house because my panic attacks have been crippling.

Has anyone else been in this position?  Is there a way for me to change my doctor's opinion, or seek a new doctor with a different perspective on long term benzo usage?"
1904yea,Anxiety,2024-01-06,Did anti-depressant withdrawal ever make you question your progress in overcoming anxiety?,"I was on Effexor 225 mg for about a year and a half and then tapered off of it while getting on to zoloft (went up to 100mg).  Zoloft wasn‚Äôt cutting it, and my therapist suggested that maybe it was time to fully go off of any depressants given my progress in the past year and a half and that maybe it was time to fully go off of antidepressants given my progress in the past year and a half with learning to manage my anxiety. I was only on 100 mg of Zoloft for about one month and I started tapering off of it. I took my last dose of 12.5 mg four days ago and the withdrawal effects are pretty rough. My anxiety is heightened. I‚Äôm more irritable I cry at random times And I have very negative thoughts. It‚Äôs not always like this, but it seems to come out of the blue at different points throughout the day. 

All of this is making me question whether or not, I actually did figure out how to manage my anxiety or cope with it in a more healthy way because I feel that my anxiety has just skyrocketed instead. For those of you who managed to successfully get off of antidepressants did you return to your original anxious self?"
18z9cdk,Anxiety,2024-01-05,I keep feeling judged at work and beat myself up about it. What can I do?,"I work in a fairly competitive, fast paced company and I‚Äôve been there for a long time. Often, after a big presentation or discussion with big bosses or a large group of colleagues, I will playback what I said and start to feel judged and stupid, e.g. I didn‚Äôt answer the question well enough, person X frowned when I responded, he probably felt my answer was bad, I shouldn‚Äôt have said it this way, I could have chosen another better example‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.. the list goes on. 

I know a lot of it is likely self-perceived because my career seems to be going ok and regular people don‚Äôt go around thinking about others all day, they are also just thinking of themselves. However, I can‚Äôt stop myself feeling this way. On bad days, I yell when I‚Äôm in the car alone because I feel awful inside. On occasion, I‚Äôve even slapped myself in the face multiple times because I felt so stupid about what I‚Äôve said. The feelings usually pass after 1 to 2 days until the next event where I feel like I mess up again. 

The worst thing is I‚Äôm not even that ambitious where I‚Äôm looking to climb the corporate ladder and hence want to be better than everyone. I‚Äôm just so impacted by (real or imagined) perceptions of others.

Anyone experiences something similar? Would love to hear how I could help myself feel less like this."

18xal8p,Anxiety,2024-01-03,Anxiety over prion diseases are killing me,"Hi, I'm a 15M from the Philippines and I was wondering if I have SCJD (Prion Disease)The day before I had the symptoms were normal, nothing interesting happened and I stayed up until 3:00 for New Years. The day after that, I began experiencing the first symptom, lightheadedness (could be physical tiredness but it's my first time experiencing this) when I stood up from my chair whilst watching a short about prion diseases in deers. At the time of writing this, it's January 3, I still have that physical tiredness/lightheadedness but I'm certain its caused by my anxiety. (I once worried I had rabies from a bat that probably didn't exist lol)I just have a few questions to ask:- Is dizziness an initial symptom to SCJD?- Can my anxiety cause symptoms like weak legs, tired mind and body, twitching?- Is it rare for prion diseases to occur in 15-25 year olds?

This could be my anxiety at work but I want some reassurance or clearance because I'm struggling to eat and do normal stuff

Update: I kept on shivering after waking up in the morning despite it not being cold at all and it's not stopping. I also have muscle twitching and the urge to move my body maybe from anxiety. Scratch dizziness, it's more like tiredness (maybe mental tiredness?). I also think I have jerky movements ;-;"
18xaaq7,Anxiety,2024-01-03,Please read,"I am so stumped and defeated. I need advice. I go to so many doctors appointments and get so many tests and they all come back pretty much normal. I got back on depression medicine after being able to not be on it for years and was able to go through the worst time in my life without the assistance of medicine and just therapy. I will give you guys a timeline. 

October - It started in October with a ear infection, it was incredibly mild. I was dizzy, brain fog, tired and just didn‚Äôt feel well but the dizziness made me anxious. Finished the antibiotics. Symptoms persisted with ear fullness but no pain, I felt like I couldn‚Äôt focus. 
Went to urgent care, ER , vestibular physical therapist, ophthalmologist, primary care physician. 

November- ALL symptoms still persisted but my anxiety got worse, everyday I was dizzy. Nothing I did made it better. I was drained and felt like this for a month. I got another round of antibiotics for the ear infection that I still had. I felt like I was in a constant state of fight or flight. It was hard to move and hard to do things because of the dizziness. 
I was so worn out about trying to find out what was wrong and nobody could find anything so it started messing with my mental health bad. 
Went to ER 2x, urgent care, vestibular physical therapist. 

December- this is where things really started to ramp up. Dizziness continued (of course), anxiety, couldn‚Äôt focus, incredibly tired, lack of motivation, no longer felt like eating as much. I laid on the couch and cried for days because every doctor I went to made me feel like it was all in my head and all I wanted to do was feel normal again. I finally and reluctantly decided to get on Wellbutrin and buspar (I was on it a couple years prior) and still kept having symptoms but the mental symptoms like intrusive thoughts and sadness really dulled down which helped. But I was still tired. 
Then one day the dizziness calmed down significantly to the point where I barely notice it when for months it was all I thought about. However the other symptoms continue. 
Went to primary doctor 2x, ENT, audiologist, physical therapy, chiropractor, psychiatrist. 

I am so beyond at a loss for where else to turn. It‚Äôs obvious the symptoms are not all in my head but it does wear on me mentally because I have yet to find answers. I‚Äôm trying any doctor that I can and I‚Äôm not looking for any sympathy I just need advice, help any type of information that could point me in the right direction. 

This is the reason I came to Reddit, for advice and joining groups and listening to people who have gone through similar things and I‚Äôve tried to find the correlations and seek answers but I‚Äôm not sure what to do now. I have a neurologist and endocrinologist appointment for this month to try to see if they give me any more information than what I already have. I will be posting this on other groups too"
18xa8vk,Anxiety,2024-01-03,How do I get better if I am legit afraid to take anything to help me? Long post but need advice.,"My brother passed away when I was in college. I had zero anxiety ever and then began panic attacks. It knocked me really down and I was prescribed medicine (which helped) and used alcohol, marijuana, and more so avoidance for YEARS. I went on and off medicine. Got super sick every year. Put on adderall, put on antibiotics bc of how sick I was, and lastly was put on Wellbutrin. No one ever told me to workout and try therapy just shoved pills down my throat. Which sucks, but I was just at fault for not trying other avenues.

It was here where bad anxiety got 100000 x worse (after Wellbutrin for 3 months). It worked GREAT at first but then it led to cluster headaches which scared the SHIT OUT of me in the middle of the night. I developed pretty bad OCD and trust issues with doctors and some people. It also led to permanent migraine issues and stomach problems for MONTHS after which is still present but not as bad. Even more than I already had. I vowed to never take another drug and I haven‚Äôt. I drink and smoke weed on VERY rare occasions. Thats all. During Covid I lost 30 pounds, was happy/healthier than ever, and then I took a job that was very stressful and gained everything back. Migraines were still present and OCD was too.

I can‚Äôt sleep well. I grind my teeth. My jaw is stuck in permanent stress position. Therapy works but not doing the job. I am told I‚Äôm great at what I do and feel like I couldn‚Äôt even work as an Uber driver (not knocking it but my confidence is nil). I have NO release. Working out doesn‚Äôt do it (helps more than anything). I used to smoke weed as a release and I think it truly did help but I fear I have some form of CHS due to my previous awful nausea. Ketamine worked but that‚Äôs the ONLY thing I‚Äôve tried (which was a miracle in itself) and I hated doing it bc I‚Äôm injecting drugs in to my veins. The only reason I did is bc it‚Äôs in and out and I did a TON of research. I have adderall but I‚Äôm terrified to take it. I‚Äôve even been to naturopaths and refuse their recommendations bc I honestly think they just want money for sugar pills that could also make me sick or give me an allergic reaction.

I‚Äôm at a loss. The only thing I haven‚Äôt tried is mushroooms. Which I really want to try. But I‚Äôm so scared and that‚Äôs a long time to journey. I would do this legally if I did it.

Point is, wtf do I do. I‚Äôm a lovable person, dad, husband and son. And I get out of bed with no energy or drive. I try to workout and it just makes me even more tired. I‚Äôm happy but I‚Äôm unhappier than ever and it‚Äôs SO subconscious idk wtf to do. My moods are up and down and I just hate it for my wife and kids. I want to BREAK my chains. Any advice?"
18x9vp6,Anxiety,2024-01-03,Idk what to do tbh,"Hey ya‚Äôll. I‚Äôm new to this group. I‚Äôve read different posts with others who deal with anxiety. I just wanted to share my experience with it (in this moment) and I just want some advice + to see if anyone deals with this.

I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety about a year ago. No one really prepares you for how you‚Äôll feel after the diagnosis. I felt hopeless, and my life isn‚Äôt the same. I went into the doctor‚Äôs office for a very different thing. I had chest pains and shoulder blade pain in my right arm. Thought it was a heart problem, but my vitals were fine. My heart was pumping sufficiently. Also went to the emergency room to get tests done and it was the same thing. Nothings wrong.

Lately, I was in a stressful situation at my home. I had to go back because school was on break, and I didn‚Äôt want to be alone. During the break, I spiraled a lot. I cried. My back was hurt so much that I couldn‚Äôt find comfort in sleeping. Now that I‚Äôm back at school, my back has totally relaxed more than it did while I was on break. However, I‚Äôm having other health issues. I can‚Äôt sleep. Everytime I try to fall asleep at night, I feel impending doom. Like I jump out of it and I‚Äôm scared to go back to sleep. I get cold feelings in different places in my body. It feels like I have butterflies in my chest and stomach. My heart feels fluttery. I want to laugh and cry. It‚Äôs awful. I even go breathless when I lay down. 

Has anyone else experienced this? I want to go to the doctor, but I‚Äôm tired of being viewed as ‚Äúcrazy.‚Äù"

I‚Äôm 24, a farmer, have a beautiful wife (22), we live in a nice enough two bedroom house with our two dogs. I have always dealt with anxiety from when I was a kid, going through school being tubby and all that, but now I just feel like I keep making mistake after mistake that will ultimately end me. 

I‚Äôve made poor financial decisions, which I‚Äôve worked myself to death to fix and make up for, and now 3 years on they still bite me in the ass.

I have no friends, as my constant panic attacks have lead me to being more drained at the end of the day/week than I‚Äôve ever been before and I haven‚Äôt seen anyone outside of work but my wife and her parents in nearly 3 months. 

I‚Äôm not even sure how to totally explain this to you guys. But it‚Äôs the feeling of just knowing I‚Äôve got to get up each morning and repeat what I‚Äôve been doing for months with no change that‚Äôs really been getting to me. I don‚Äôt seem to be getting anywhere and every couple of weeks I get my hopes up thinking that I really gave last week my all and I‚Äôll be able to get ahead come this week and maybe get a weekend off to go on a trip with the wife, but there always seems to be something that appears to bite me in the ass, wether it‚Äôs a 500$ fine from 3 months ago the mailman forgot to deliver to me or someone‚Äôs spreading rumours or the boss forgot to order enough fert, so I‚Äôve got to drive 14 hours to get it. There‚Äôs always something to put me back in my place at the bottom and I can‚Äôt for the life of me figure out how to get out from under it.

PS. The reason I tend not to let my wife in on these thoughts and hide any sort of panic attack I have from her as I am her only source of support out here and I love her with all my heart. I‚Äôd never dream of letting her see me in the state I‚Äôm in right now as it would take her structure out from under her and I can‚Äôt do that to her."

18x8xgq,Anxiety,2024-01-03,"Severe anxiety about asbestos exposure, please help","TW: cancer related fear

We had the floor replaced in the front half of our house back in 2022. The contractors who did the job exposed a lot of black substance that I now assume is black mastic which, due to the age of our house, probably contains asbestos. It's not dangerous if left alone, but they were sanding it down (which is the worst thing you can do as it causes the asbestos to become airborne). At one point I could see visible dust in the air at the front of our house. As far as I'm aware, the only safety precaution they had in place was that they used a HEPA vac to clean up the remaining dust on the floor.

Asbestos exposure can cause mesothelioma, and it usually doesn't show up for 20-30 years after the initial exposure. I'm TERRIFIED that my house has been contaminated and that I have been breathing in the asbestos fibers for over a year now. I had a breakdown a couple months ago because I was convinced I wouldn't live past 40. Some people on the internet seem convinced I will be fine, while others tell me I'm doomed. I don't understand the vast difference in opinion here.

If anyone has knowledge of asbestos or mesothelioma could you put my mind at ease, I could really use it. Do you think I am overreacting? How can I cope with thinking I am a dead man walking?"

18x7zgr,Anxiety,2024-01-03,Does this sound like some form of anxiety?? Brain zaps/elevator falling feeling‚Ä¶,"
Hope this is ok to post I also posted in askdocs‚Ä¶some of this may be repetitive but want to highlight I‚Äôve never been an anxious person or had major anxiety‚Ä¶when these things happen I don‚Äôt feel anxious either so it makes no sense. 

35f. 160lbs, non smoker, 5‚Äô5, I have asthma and take  symbixort and ventolin, omeprazole for acid reflux and serc for vertigo

Just as title says I‚Äôve been getting these recurring sensations where I‚Äôm just sitting still and for a split second it will feel like the floor is falling out from under me. It‚Äôs also reminiscent of when something super startles you and burning moves fast for a second. I have vertigo but it‚Äôs controlled and these sensations are nothing like it at all. Other times it feels like a zap or a jolt in my brain that literally makes me jerk my head. 
I‚Äôm having trouble googling this because every thing I read says either anxiety/stresss or coming off of anit depressants (for the zaps specifically) I have neither..I‚Äôve never been on anti depressants of any sort and I‚Äôm really not stressed or an anxious person. Not to mention these spells occur in the least anxiety inducing situations ever like sitting on my couch while the kids sit and play or just at my desk at work. Even laying in bed reading and relaxing they will hit. It‚Äôs never the traditional ‚Äúgot up to fast‚Äù or anything either. 
I just had one a few minutes ago and now I feel headachy and a little dizzy but nothing crazzy. Normally after these my heart will race I‚Äôll feel ‚Äúoff‚Äù then it‚Äôll be fine. 
I‚Äôve gone probably 7 months without feeling these and now it‚Äôs been like 4 in a week. Early 2023 I had a few spaced out over a couple months sprinkled in with a couple ‚Äúvasovagal syncope‚Äôs‚Äù. I haven‚Äôt had one of those since may either. I‚Äôm honestly at a loss. I‚Äôve had all the tests‚Ä¶ eeg, several ekgs, an echo, two holters, 2 Ct scans and an mri. They also did an ultrasound of my neck for what they thought was pulsatile tinnitus (I can super hear my pulse when I‚Äôm laying on my side like woosh woosh woosh). 
So I‚Äôm squeaky clean and healthy which is great‚Ä¶but no answers or ways to stop them.  I also eat well, do spin classes and lift weights leisurely and have a decent job/low stress/great family. I‚Äôve been asked to up my sodium/electrolytes which I do. I‚Äôm well hydrated and have balanced the electrolytes. So WHY do these little ‚Äúfits‚Äù keep happening? What can be done? All my bloodwork has been okay too. 
I don‚Äôt know if this is relevant either but I also have these little issues with random parts of my body twitching or going numb for a couple hours to couple days. For example my left pointer finger is mildly numb/feels heavy and has been for a couple days. My left peck muscle was twitching the other day to the point where my heart felt like it was spasming. This happens randomly too to my nose tip, lip, eye brow, toe, shin etc. either twitching or a numb feeling. 
I‚Äôm at a loss. After how frequent the syncopes/brain zaps were last year I finally stopped being afraid of them hitting me at random/dangerous times and now they‚Äôre back."

I‚Äôve had this issue for a long time and it‚Äôs got worse. Whenever I‚Äôm having a conversation with someone, I imagine they are about to punch me at any moment.

Since then, I always, always imagine that a person will suddenly hit me no matter who they are. Man or woman. It‚Äôs scary and one of the things I‚Äôm most frightened of is brain damage. I read every day, I taught myself French and music theory, but I‚Äôm scared it will all be taken away from me. I sometimes won‚Äôt study or attend lectures because I think the chances of everything being lost from brain damage will grow due to this. It doesn‚Äôt make sense.

How bad would the brain damage be if I were concussed? Can I put my mind at ease by understanding I wouldn‚Äôt lose all of my brain power? I‚Äôve seen physical fights at work where people had their head stomped on by groups or were physically knocked unconscious. I‚Äôm terrified I‚Äôll be next. I hate violence and always have. Even the nicest kids at school would run to watch fist fights and I hated it. I thought they were hypocrites. I never watched because it was brutal.

Never have a let myself be alone. Even when I was a child I had problems with loneliness, even when people are around me. I needed comfort, love, human touch; yet I let no one touch me. I‚Äôve never liked to be touched, I pull away from hugs even with my family. I tolerate hugs from friends, but in actually I will never feel comfortable with others hands on me. 

If I look back and think, where could this feeling come from? 

Haphephobia
The fear of being touched.
It has a name. Once you can put a name to something then you‚Äôd be able to pick it apart. Wrapping my head around this was and is very hard. Thinking to myself is this going to be something that I can actually fix? Something I‚Äôd be able to use exposure therapy for? Can I just walk up to people and let them touch me or hug me. I think not. My OCD compulsions have taken over my life. 

Mysophobia
Is the fear of germs. It sends shivers down my spine just thinking about being dirty unclean, untouchable. Having the outside air touch my skin causes me great distress. It hasn‚Äôt been this bad in a long time. I‚Äôd been properly medicated for years now. Even been with a therapist for three years, Until she retired. 

Where do I go from here. 
I honestly have no idea. I know I can‚Äôt go back to my old life, my old habits, my ex. I have to keep pushing myself forward and keep my head high. But on days like today, it‚Äôs easier said than done."

18x5a80,Anxiety,2024-01-03,Will I ever get better? Anxiety is the worst,"It's been 7 months since my life changed. I'm only 26 y/o. I was having a normal day, I was in my car as a copilot and then I started to feel like I couldn't breathe, I guess I started to panic... My chest was hurting, I got nauseous and felt like I was going to die, I got home and laid on the bed, my boyfriend told me it was probably because I hadn't eaten anything since breakfast, it was like 2 pm. I started to eat and then I started to feel bad again, I rushed to the ER and everything was fine, they told me my blood pressure was a little bit low. 

Then exactly a week passed since the incident and I started to remember everything and felt bad again, actually, this time was worse, I was shivering, and even my teeth were trembling. I rushed to the ER again, and everything was fine, my blood pressure was normal this time, they did an EKG and I got sinus tachycardia, but nothing to worry about, since I was feeling bad they sent me to a cardiologist, he did an echocardiogram, and some other tests and my heart was fine. Got my Holter monitor and map, and everything was good but for some reason, I still have sinus tachycardia. Now I know I was having panic attacks. Fast forward he gave me some medicine for anxiety and an NSAID for chest pain. This was the worst my stomach started to ache daily (For the record I already had stomach pain randomly some weeks before), Then I went to a gastroenterologist and after endoscopy, yup, I got chronic gastritis. I switched cardiologists and the new one tested me again, she said that everything was fine but I did have some sinus tachycardia without reason, so now I'm on beta-blockers.

Gastritis has been hell for me, the treatment for H pylori destroyed me, and acid reflux had me going to the ER like twice a week thinking it was a heart attack because I didn't feel like a burning sensation, it was like pain-pain. Now I have this awful cardiophobia, if my chest hurts, I think I'm gonna die.

Two months later, I wasn't able to leave my bed because, with every effort I made, my heart started to beat fast. I got this awful back and neck pain so my then fiancee recommended a chiropractor, he went some time ago and they were able to help him, for some reason, I started to develop more pain after every adjustment, but with the last one I felt like something was different, I felt severely ill. After that day my chest started to hurt, and it's been 4 months. 

Now every day my chest hurts, my back hurts, my laterals hurt, and I have developed muscle spasms all over my body, on my arms, back, chest, legs, and even on my booty. Sometimes the pain feels muscular and it gets worse with the touch, sometimes burns and sometimes it's sharp. The issue is that I have severe cardiophobia and every time my chest hurts I think it's a heart attack, even though doctors say my heart is fine. I'm still taking beta-blockers for my tachycardia. Sometimes I have palpitations. I went to a psychologist, but tbh even though therapy is fine, I go one step forward and two backward. Recently I got married and  I'm walking daily, exercising in the gym, eating better, meditating, and doing some breathing techniques, but honestly, I feel like I'm not getting any better.

I went to different doctors to get checked out for my pains and no one has been able to help me, so many lab tests, x-rays, and even a CT and nothing, I'm waiting on the neurologist to see if it's some nerve issue, but I have to wait for another week because he's on vacations, but I can't take it anymore, I feel like I'm dying, I feel like I'm not going to get better, I get this intrusive thoughts about every day being my last and honestly I'm so tired, and it's no fair to my now husband. 

Has someone been through something similar? I need some hope. 

English is not my first language so please forgive any mistake.

Can anxiety just.. give you high hr when standing or doing anything?

This makes me think is actually pots but..
When I was reallly nervous to speak with someone important, I had a benzo and it did nothing to calm me down. My hr was 140 just because I was soooo stressed about the convo..

The worst thing about this newer panic attacks is electrical jolts! Back in high school my panic attacks were so bad that I missed half of my classes and did silent classes in the resource room because I had a learning disability. The panic attacks were fear of nausea because I had a emtophobia really bad back in the day but because of chronic illness, I got over my emetaphobia because my chronic illness makes me vomit. However 15 years later, I have been experiencing worse panic attacks which concludes electrical jolts through my head and body. I've been to the emergency room six times in 2 months because I thought I was literally dying, and they could not find anything wrong with me.

 So I saw my neurologist they gave me a seizure test and MRI. Everything came back normal. So I've been seeing my psychiatrist who have to see a new one because the other one retired, the retired psych said 99% sure it's panic attacks. I've been diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder and panic disorder but haven't dealt with a panic attack in over 15 years when I was in high school, my age currently is 30. I've never had these electrical jolts before and they are so scary. One time I was at the grocery store and I had it so bad where my vision went black and I screamed in the middle of the store everyone looked at me and I thought I was going crazy. Has anyone experienced this before? I am on antidepressants but doctors dont seem to want to prescribe anything for anxiety. I have been going thru a lot of stress in my life.

Recently I‚Äôve been prescribed Propranolol for panic attacks to take AS needed. The few times I‚Äôve taken it (when I noticed my heart rate is high or I‚Äôm anxious about something), it of course lowers physical symptoms of heart rate but it makes me incredibly slow and dizzy? I feel really out of it, not completely stopping the panic attack from coming on.

Is this because I need to take it for a few weeks for my body to adapt? I‚Äôve only taken it when needed, so like 3x in past 2 weeks. I‚Äôve read a lot here (and have fam members) who say Propranolol works great for them so I don‚Äôt necessarily want to give up yet. 

My panic attacks are usually triggered mentally and the physical symptoms follow. I‚Äôm wondering if I need a benzo instead. I know those are addicting tho and hard to ween off so I really want propranolol to work!! 

If anyone has advice or similar experience lmk! I‚Äôll be seeing my psychiatrist this week and want to decide on if I‚Äôll be sticking w Prop or should swap."

I am a 31 yr old female who has been experiencing burning sensations in my pelvic region &amp; legs. I went to the ER and they ran a blood/urine test. Everything cleared except for very low Vitamin D (9). I was told it's due to my sedentary lifestyle (I work from home and usually do so laying down) and I need to start exercising. My PCP prescribed a weekly high dose of Vit D.

A week ago, I started walking an hour a day and noticed that my muscles started twitching after two days of walking. I am also experiencing numbness in my hands and legs. I immediately ran to google &amp; diagnosed myself with ***. I now have severe anxiety and my twitches haven't gone away, it's been a week! 

I am terrified that I have it and my twitching will lead to muscle weakness and progress, even though my recent exercise routine may be the cause. I made the mistake of reading stories of 30 year olds getting A** and their first symptom being twitching and taking years to be officially diagnosed. Now I can't get it out of my head! My mom's cousin passed from the disease.  I developed a severe health anxiety and can't even get a good night's sleep. I keep convincing myself that I have it since it has been only a week and I have lots of time to experience muscle weakness :((. Has anyone experienced this that can help?"

I drank heavily from age 22-38, so now I‚Äôm really worried about heart damage.

It all started with me basically passing out one night while getting ice cream out of the freezer. I told my doctor who referred me to a cardiologist. I have had an EKG, went back for the heart echo and they found ‚Äúpossible slight damage‚Äù. 

So now, I‚Äôm off to get a nuclear stress test next week and I am TERRIFIED. I am not in bad shape, why do they have to inject something in my body that will raise my heart rate? Why would they not just put me on the exercise machine.

So I am terrified of not only the test, but what they will find. If it‚Äôs anything, probably the alcohol has damaged my heart along the way. I am five years sober, for what it‚Äôs worth.

How was your experience with the nuclear stress test? Do they always pump something into your IV to increase your heart rate?

18x31am,Anxiety,2024-01-02,Panic Attacks on Planes - Flight Anxiety,"Hello! I just joined this subreddit and would love to hear from further anxiety sufferers. I am trying to prepare myself for a work trip in 2 months where I have to fly cross country (DC to San Francisco). Last time I flew, I had a panic attack mid-flight because of some turbulence we were having. Flying makes me really nervous in general, even though logically, I know it's the safest way of travel. However, what I'm mostly afraid of is getting a panic attack on the flight and being alone. I'm more afraid of how my body will react to turbulence or any other scary sound or situation on the flight than the flight itself. Once I'm in panic mode, my mind takes me to some scary scenarios like I'm having a medical emergency or heart attack and no one on the flight will be able to help me and I will die. My body physically also starts reacting. For example, my stomach gets upset, I start sweating then get cold and start shivering, etc. 

Movies/shows don't seem to distract me enough. I bring tea usually with me and it does help a bit. I would love to know what others do to keep themselves entertained, distracted and calm during flights. Do you have an anxiety kit that you take with you? 

I've been going to therapy for a while but just recently started with EMDR to try and heal this fear. I take Wellbutrin, Zoloft and Buspirone (specifically tackles anxiety) and in general, they help A LOT. It's specific situations, like flying, that everything goes out the window. I've been trying to make some diet changes as well to incorporate foods that help regulate the nervous system and combat anxiety in general. I think the one thing I'm hesitant to quit is coffee because I love the taste of it so much. I only have one small cup a day to avoid the jitters. I also started incorporating workouts, at least 2-3 times a week. 

Any other suggestions are welcome. I want to learn from others and see what I can try that will stick. "

I‚Äôm a 27 old male. I was diagnosed a generalized anxiety disorder about two years ago. Before that, for nearly four years I made so much trip to the ER and took so many medical exams that I can‚Äôt count. All the tests were always good, I‚Äôm healthy and in my family there is no people with heart disease just some cancers but due to alcoholism or tabacco with I don‚Äôt do. For people I was just stressed and I cared too much of what my body was telling me. Of course, it was panic attack, and I don‚Äôt know triggered them. In 2022, I was stressed all time, and was sure my body will let me down. To be honest, I was following everyday what happened in Ukraine and was pretty convince we will be in a WW3 pretty soon or a nuclear war. So, on the advice of a friend, I started a therapy. For a year I saw a psychologist and I was better. From august 2022 to November 2023 that was a moment, probably the best. I made friends, going out a lot, meet my girlfriend, I was no more afraid. The fear of dying and the negatives thoughts was gone. It last until the end of 2023 which was a turning point for me. Days prior the event my heart was racing a lot more than usual when I was going to work. Around 130 which high for me. I started to feel stressed again, but I had no reason to be. My job is not stressful, I have enough money to eat every day, I don‚Äôt worry about paying invoices or anything else. My biggest problem was ‚Äúwhen will have time to play video game more because I just got a PS5‚Äù. So really an easy life for dude in the West. On November 01, I was going to work and after entering the metro, I start feeling unwell. I‚Äôm feeling my heart race going faster and faster. I decide to go out of the metro and I‚Äôm outside my heart race peak at 189, I‚Äôm dizzy, I‚Äôm feeling weak, my legs are about to let me go and I‚Äôm saying to myself ‚Äúthat it, it‚Äôs how I‚Äôm gonna die‚Äù. I was on the phone with my best friend the all-time but I was sure it was the end for me. My heart would explode and goodbye. By luck I was near an ER. I go there, they do some test (ECG etc) and everything was normal. My heart race was high but not alarming (120 ish). They found nothing. As always. Since this day, I‚Äôm so afraid of everything. I don‚Äôt go out anymore. At first, I tried a few time to go out during November but I stressed all the time, I was always near my house and one time I even do a panic attack in front of it. So now I‚Äôm lost, I‚Äôm scared and I feel more alone than ever. I tried to make things better but it only getting worse. I see my psychologist weekly, my girlfriend (we live together) is highly supportive. But I‚Äôm just scared. I‚Äôm scared of going out, I‚Äôm scared of losing my job, scared of losing my girlfriend, scared of dying. I‚Äôm scared of my heart rate. That It will suddenly go fast and I will died. Every single thing is a battle. Even taking a shower is hard. I feel my heart pounding and sometimes I just go up to 140 in the shower (or even sometimes just going in the bathroom can trigger it). My doctor prescribes me some Zoloft but I can‚Äôt take it. I‚Äôm scared of the side effects, that I will mess up my heart and I will drop dead. I meditate everyday but some time I feel more stressed after then before. I don‚Äôt drink, I don‚Äôt eat fast food. I read philosophy (Stoicism) but it‚Äôs not enough. The ‚Äúwhat if‚Äù, even in a not rational moment, always win.  
I don‚Äôt know what to do anymore. It looks like anxiety is taking everything on its way and I‚Äôm just a passenger too afraid to do anything.

18x1wfn,Anxiety,2024-01-02,Panic disorder bc of stuck emotions,"I‚Äôve been on reddit for multiple years now, reading a lot of posts in this community as well. But, this is my first post on this platform. (I‚Äôve created a second account to post anonymously because I have a hard time sharing my experiences)

Last month, I had my 4th year ‚Äòanniversary‚Äô of having a panic disorder. Although I have other diagnoses as well which I have been successfully treated for, my panic disorder has troubled me the most by far. 

In short a little back story about me: frequent panic attacks ranging from 1 every few days to more often upwards of 5 per day, sometimes disabling me from being able to perform daily activities. Handling a full time job (40 hrs a week) in a target driven business.

Following years of treatment, the conclusion is that the origin of my panic disorder lays in the lack of being able to express my emotions. For example: I feel rage inside my body but I am afraid to express the rage because earlier on in life, I was taught to hold back expressing my emotions. My body automatically turns that oppressed rage into a panic attack as a coping mechanism. All so I do not have to experience my emotions. 

I actually have 3 questions which I‚Äôd love to ask this community. 

1. Do/did any of you have panic attacks / disorder because of a similar cause? If so, how do you deal with it?

2. Have any of you had a panic disorder for multiple years and found a way to cope with it in life? Note: coping for me means living a happy life.

3. My panic attacks are mainly focused on the fear of losing control. Have any of you guys found a way to cope with the constant anxiety about potentially losing control?

If any of you are able to answer either one of these questions (or all) I‚Äôd be very grateful. Thank you for reading my story. For me, it‚Äôs a very big thing to go public with this and share my (very summarized) story."
18x1sdt,Anxiety,2024-01-02,"I don‚Äôt know if this is from anxiety and/or medication. While trying to fall asleep, does anyone else have something similar to hypnic jerks, but without the jerk?","I take 7.5mg of buspar 3x each day. A hypnic jerk makes the most sense when I look it up. The best way I can describe it is during the transition from awake to asleep, I feel conscious longer, like closer to the state of being asleep. So I‚Äôm conscious, thinking, and without having any feeling of being asleep in the slightest, I‚Äôm popping my eyes open (kind of startled but with no jerk). Often then I just feel kind of off, kind of groggy (not the best word to describe it) and a general anxious/scared feeling. Sometimes I feel like I‚Äôm starting to dream while I‚Äôm still somewhat conscious and suddenly I‚Äôm awake again. 

I‚Äôve been on buspar for 3 years and never had an issue until about 6 months ago (no change in dosage). It only happens when I‚Äôm already in a state of anxiety. I still feel like buspar plays a part in this because I have tried adjusting the time of my last dosage and it‚Äôs more likely to happen if I take buspar closer to bedtime. Even if it‚Äôs not the buspar and only anxiety, I‚Äôve had anxiety for 20 years and never had this issue. 

Sometimes it‚Äôs kinda scary and I don‚Äôt like the ‚Äúgroggy‚Äù and anxious feeling I have afterwards. I guess my biggest concern with this is I don‚Äôt like the feeling after but I also really don‚Äôt like the dreamlike state before falling asleep."

Luna understood that she didn't have to please everyone. Like the sun, she couldn't brighten every corner at once. But her light was powerful, capable of touching hearts and illuminating paths. Embracing this truth, she released the burden of trying to please everyone.

Sometimes, Luna's mind played tricks on her, filling her thoughts with self-doubt. But she discovered that these thoughts were not her reality. With a courageous spirit, she learned to let them go, setting herself free from their grasp.

Luna realized that comparing herself to others only dimmed her light. She was unique, special, and rare. Each person she encountered had their own journey, their own dreams. So instead of comparing, Luna celebrated her individuality and embraced the differences that made her shine.

In the company of others, Luna remained true to herself. She understood that no one could truly know the depths of her thoughts and emotions. So she chose to be authentic, allowing her genuine self to radiate like a guiding star. And in doing so, she discovered happiness and freedom, living her life with zeal.

Luna recognized that her thoughts were within her control. She could release the ones that caused distress and hold onto those that brought peace. With the power of her mind, she became the master of her own thoughts, bidding farewell to anxiety.

With every realization, Luna's confidence grew. She knew, without a doubt, that she was more than enough. She not only survived, but thrived and soared to unimaginable heights. Her light became a beacon of hope for others, inspiring them to believe in their own worth.

""Yes,"" Luna declared, her voice resonating across the universe. ""I am enough and more!"" Her spirit ignited with passion, fueling her determination. She embraced her true self, a radiant star bursting with sunshine, joy, and peace. And as she released her worries, her heart danced with a melody of contentment.

So, my friend, remember Luna's tale. You too are enough, worthy, strong, and tough. No challenge is insurmountable, no dream too far. Believe in yourself, let your light shine, and make your heart sing. For within you lies a brilliance that can illuminate the world."

18x1izs,Anxiety,2024-01-02,A year of stressful events is taking its toll,"I am going to try not make a super long post but during 2023 I experienced a lot of difficult situations that I feel is affecting me all at once in different ways.

A bit of background I am diagnosed bipolar disorder and adhd and medicated.

So 2023 has been a tough year and some situations happened quite close together:

- at the start of the year I cut my best friend of 10 years out of my life because I finally realised I was not being treated right
- I got a new manager at work who was extremely toxic 
- my dad went to a psych hospital for a manic episode, I took time off work for stress
- dad got better but my work situation didn‚Äôt I did 8 months of therapy during the stressful time in work I decided to work my notice after coming back from a second time of stress leave as I realised It wasn‚Äôt worth it.
- noticed I was isolating more I am introverted but I was avoiding social gatherings even bursting into tears before leaving for a party and deciding to stay home.
- got a procedure to remove pre cancerous cells under general anaesthetic which completely messed me up for a week after.
- a week after that my dad went for knee surgery 
- my dad came home and 3 days before Christmas he got rushed to hospital as a clot went to his lungs and spent 5 days in icu

My dad is still in hospital but on an acute ward now and he is on the mend thankfully and I visit him everyday.

I noticed during the actual crisis period I could handle it well but now I feel drained. On NYE I cancelled plans last minute I was suppose to go to a small social gathering with my boyfriend I got overwhelmed and cried before leaving and we stayed at home. I was never a huge fan of social gatherings but I could grin and bear them. 

I feel I am starting to avoid situations a lot more but I wouldn‚Äôt say I‚Äôm depressed. Weirdly my sleep is ok for the moment but my jaw hurts from clenching my teeth so much and I seem to squirm and block out when family members go into detail of the night my dad got taken in the ambulance ( I was not at home when it happened) 

 I am talking to my psychiatrist tomorrow about this but I am looking for some advice if people experienced similar from being stressed for a long time.

Thanks in advance :)"

He prescribed me 20mg lexapro, and to take 10 for first two weeks.. I tried to take it but the side effects were so bad first two days so I switched to taking half of the half instead( so 5mg) I haven‚Äôt had a panic attack since being on it but I still have all these pains and anxious thoughts.  Head aches everyday, just something not feeling right.  Random chest pains, arm, leg and back pains, shoulder pains.  But here recently have been noticing blood pulling in hands, they get all red, hot and bulging veins even up arm.  Now hands are almost always red and it I touch my palm/ fingers they go white for a second then back red, unless I raise them above heart. You can also see white spots on hands.  I took a shower and fingers pruned up beyond fast and became colorless. I don‚Äôt know what this is could it all be anxiety?  My symptoms worsening? A vascular issue, or side effects of lexapro?

18x1f6q,Anxiety,2024-01-02,Asking my boss for time off,"Hello everyone, 

I am about 2 months into a job. This job is leasing and it‚Äôs a fairly easy job.  
(I‚Äôve worked in student leasing before and traditional leasing is farrrr easier.) 

The only employees are me and my boss. (The property manager) because most of the renters are renewals and have been for the last 10+ years with maybe 100 residents total property-wide. 

I‚Äôve done a good job getting acclimated to this job and I feel like I‚Äôve picked up everything already with minimal mistakes. 

(Since I‚Äôm new, I don‚Äôt have any PTO or holiday pay for 6 months. So to preface, she isn‚Äôt paying me for any time I take off or any time that the office is closed for holidays)

November-January are really busy months for me and my partner. We‚Äôve gone back and forth to his hometown for thanksgiving and Christmas, and we have a vacation coming up on the 10th of this month for a week. 

We were offered through my partner‚Äôs work to get PAID to go on another vacation the 27th-1st (two of those days are weekend days that I don‚Äôt work anyways). 
It‚Äôs a trip to my dream vacation destination and I‚Äôve wanted to go here since I was young. 

So the reason I writing this, is because my boss is someone who ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt take time off even when you‚Äôre sick‚Äù and has 200+ hours of PTO that she chooses to not use every year (even if it doesn‚Äôt roll over) 

So I‚Äôm worried about how to tell her that I have this vacation coming up a week (right after another vacation).

(This is irrelevant to my exact situation (kind of) but we are moving from our current place (college town)  in May to a major city and I‚Äôm quitting the job to go back to school anyways so I will be leaving regardless in the next 4 months minimum)  

And I know I shouldn‚Äôt focus on what people think about me but I‚Äôm just a really anxious person and I am worried about her saying I cannot have the time off and having to quit.

I appreciate any input. And I‚Äôm able to answer any questions.
 Thanks!"

18x0p3e,Anxiety,2024-01-02,Cardiophobia/health anxiety is consuming my life,"TW: breif mention of marijuana useage

TLDR: Cardiophobia fucking sucks. I feel heart attack symptoms constantly and feel like im going to die every day. 

Back in September, I started having really bad heart palpitations. My heart would skip beats pretty badly. Went to the ER twice for it, they checked me out and said I was fine, gave me some meds, did a 3 day holter monitor, and got sent to a cardiologist who also said I was fine but sent me to get a Stress Echo which also came back fine. 

Since then, my Dad, whom has been extremely heathy for the past 20 years, went in to get a calcium screen which came back extremely high. He ended up having a bad stress echo and had open heart surgery with 5 bypasses. 

After he had his surgery, I cannot stop thinking that it may be genetic. And with my previous palps (which have gotten much better since I switched my asthma meds) its even worse. I have had approx 10-15 EKGs since then, chest xrays, and been put on a non-narcotic anxiety medication. Nothing seems to ease the stress. I even stopped vaping and smoking weed. Which may have made my anxiety even worse.

Ill get symptoms ranging from tightness in my left pec to tightness/tingling/mild pain in my left arm, back pain in all different places (which ive had since high school), lightheadedness, and even pain in the jaw. Its driving me to fucking insanity. 

Recently schedule myself for a calcium screen that I most likely don't even need. Every single day Ill get this feeling that im about to die. Life is becoming short of impossible to enjoy. Couldnt even enjoy Christmas this year thanks to all this.

Edit: I have never been an anxious person up until this started. Not that it makes much of a difference "
18x0inc,Anxiety,2024-01-02,I feel like I can't be the person I want to be... because that type of person doesn't exist,"To give a brief introduction and context, I am 30 years old, have aspergers and work as an instructional designer for a university in the UK. In my spare time, I play video games, watch anime/TV and films and browse social media.

I am fairly new to my career, but enjoy what I do nonetheless and love learning as I go along. That being said, I feel like a lot of what I do in my spare time holds me back somehow from being the professional that I aspire to be in many ways. By that, I mean in a more senior role hopefully one day!

I see a lot of other people who work in the same industry as me, who either don't have social media as far as I know, or if they do they just have a LinkedIn or a Twitter account that is basically LinkedIn for them (i.e they retweet what their company posts out, etc.). Meanwhile, my Twitter mainly consists of retweets of video game art and the occasional shitpost.

Is it wrong to think that my hobbies (video games, anime, films, etc.) are a poor reflection on myself as a working professional? I feel like a lot of other people who are either on the same level as me career-wise, or miles ahead of me have more 'mature' hobbies - and that feels like a strange thing to type, but it also feels like the truth at the same time.

I honestly don't know what constitutes a 'mature' hobby when I say this - but I think it stems from guilt of not being productive 24/7 (something I have talked about here previously) and perhaps taking too much of social media at face value and not seeing the bigger picture (again, something I have posted about recently) but I want to know what your advice would be; do you ever feel this guilt or like there's something in your way that stops you from unlocking your true potential? Or like, you feel like you can't be your authentic self while also holding down a stable job?

If you're someone who likes to play video games, usually as a main hobby, do you feel like it reflects on what you do for a living, or just on you as a person? Ideally, I want to be able to enjoy the hobbies that I do, but not feel this sense of guilt everytime I do because I am a 'professional' and feel like there is a level of standard I have to achieve each day if I want to be succesful as well in terms of my career, like something is telling me in the back of my mind ""You either want to be a gaming nerd, or a working professional, you can't be both. Choose one."""

18wz9pe,Anxiety,2024-01-02,IV Sedation,"Hello all,

I‚Äôve posted on here quite a few times and here I am again üò∞ on Thursday at 11am I will be undergoing iv sedation for a molar extraction/bone graft and 5 fillings on my right side. To say I am nervous is an understatement. I have put off dental treatment for years and ended up with an abscess, took 3 weeks of antibiotics to put off treatment and drilled out my own filling with the hopes I could just let ‚Äúmy tooth drain‚Äù and put it off indefinitely, which is as stupid and done in a moment of intense panic and regretted.

I am posting here for support and encouragement, and of course for any real life great examples of how your procedures went.

My fears:
- Being Sedated - How will it feel? I don‚Äôt do any drugs or drink (I used to a lot when I was younger but weed ended up giving me panic attacks and intense anxiety. Drinking also started to give anxiety and I just don‚Äôt like being out of control) and I don‚Äôt even take ibprofuen unless it‚Äôs excruciating. I hate not feeling in control of my own body so this is super scary to me. My legit hope is that I‚Äôll be sitting there (probably crying lol) and then wake up fully oriented and it‚Äôs all done. The in between bits where I may feel dizzy or disoriented or drunk or high, it‚Äôs freaking me out.

- Dying - I should say this is a huge anxiety for me. I‚Äôve spent weeks agonizing over possibly dying from this and leaving behind my husband and teenage daughter over something I choose to do vs something mandatory. I‚Äôm having the IV sedation because of my dental phobia, so I know this is the best and safest way to have my dental work done (for my health) but it feels so so scary and if I died from it then my mind feels like I am choosing it.
Ways I‚Äôm worried about dying specifically:
1. allergic reaction - I‚Äôve never had midazolam as far as I know and I‚Äôve not ever had any other benzos
2. stop breathing and they can‚Äôt get it back
3. cardiac arrest
3. complications from local anesthesia (brachycardia or overdose)

- Paradoxical reactions - I am absolutely terrified the midazolam could make me crazy, combative, and hallucinate. I know it happens in like less than 1% of people and they‚Äôre usually old or young (and I‚Äôm in the middle at 36, almost 37) but my brain has fixated on this because it would be terrifying. I did find some comfort here in reading studies that father reversal drug for midazolam (flunazemil?) is also about to reverse paradoxical reactions, but I‚Äôm just worried if it happened and all and I remembered it that I could suffer mental complications long term from the terror.

Those are the things I‚Äôm most scared of, and they‚Äôre all in regards to control. I am trying to remind myself that anxiety doesn‚Äôt change outcomes, and trust my dentist and his team to fully take care of me and safely provide me the dental treatment I so desperately need, but it‚Äôs been a struggle.

Any and all encouragement is absolutely appreciated. I know that there are other dental phobics just like me, who have had these same worries and fears to the point of letting it rule their minds and lives also, but it‚Äôs so hard for me to believe any one else has ever been this scared.

This forum has helped me thus far, I think I‚Äôve read every single iv sedation experience 100 times over. I am hopeful that I‚Äôll be reporting back on Thursday will a great result and excited to fully handle my dental journey this year. Pray for me!"

Research suggests social work or counseling, but firsthand accounts make me uncertain. ""Jobs for HSP"" articles propose challenging options, unsuitable for severe anxiety. Stress is pervasive, despite medication and therapy attempts to rewire my brain. Seeking advice on suitable paths or insights from those navigating similar challenges. Has anyone found a job they truly like and can tolerate at least? Thanks!!"

1911o46,Anxiety,2024-01-07,Anxiety symptoms?,"So on July 2023 Is when my symptoms started as heart racing and having this intense feeling all over my body feeling like fainting. Then after that ive been feeling the same thing maybe twice a week including light sensitivity and change in my vision where everything looks weird and it feels like the world  is not real. I‚Äôve gone to many doctors like cardiologist, neurologist, ent doctor and ER and they haven‚Äôt found anything. I also had an intense painful  headache that felt like I was going to faint and went to the Er again and they found nothing. The symptoms slowly went away except my vision has not gone back to normal. And now 2 weeks ago I started getting blurred vision and feeling like fainting after that I got dizzy  24/7 again that is hard to work and I have sensitivity to light. I also get palpitations sometimes chest pain and headaches. I have done all the testing for cardiologist and got cleared I got an mri scan it was clear and I even got glasses for my vision and I still get dizzy. Could all this be from anxiety or could it be anxiety symptoms with somthing else? I went to a different doctor now and he wants me to get second opinion on cardiologist and ENT. Does anyone have the same  symptoms as me? I need help figuring out what it is. And I also feel fatigue and I am no longer anemic as I got iron infusion on July thinking it‚Äôs what caused my symptoms.

18wxf52,Anxiety,2024-01-02,Intense physical symptoms for over a year and struggling to cope,"TL:DR been experiencing intense anxiety for over a year and can‚Äôt stop thinking that the physical symptoms are symptoms of some deadly disease 

Hi I‚Äôm M 21 and living in the UK. I have intense physical symptoms of anxiety daily and have done for about a year and a half. Despite seeking medical advice multiple times I can‚Äôt convince myself that I‚Äôm not seriously Ill.

Some backstory. During the summer of 2022 I was in a supermarket and noticed my heart began to race. I started breathing rapidly, felt like I was going to pass out but also explode at the same time, I felt like I was going to be sick and felt like I was having a heart attack. I genuinely thought I was going to die. My mother raced me to the hospital where they saw me and monitored me. They took bloods, did multiple ECG‚Äôs and found nothing. They actually said despite my white blood cell count being a little lower than usual, I was in really good health. After this I cut everything bad out of my life, energy drinks, smoking, weed, alcohol EVERYTHING . I do still vape but with a negligible amount of nicotine.

For a month after this I CONSTANTLY felt nauseous, dizzy, shaky, fearful etc so I went back to the doctor stressing that I continued to have really bad symptoms and a rapid heart. After further investigation they then diagnosed me with SVT (super ventricular tachycardia- basically means your heart isn‚Äôt pumping blood enough) so this terrified me, turned out to be a false diagnosis (after they tried to put me on beta blockers, I couldn‚Äôt believe how bad they were, they didn‚Äôt even examine me before attempting to medicate)

Anyway, 1 false diagnosis down I was still having symptoms. I ended up being called to the doctor when a really nice Doc told me he thought I was experiencing a form of Generalised Anxiety Disorder and Health Anxiety Disorder. When he explained more it made total sense. I had been having intense panic attacks everyday fuelled by my fear of thinking it was something life threatening. Plus the false diagnosis id previously received didn‚Äôt help to calm my mind. 

But to this day a year later, while it‚Äôs better than it was, I still have intense moments of panic even when I‚Äôm not stressed about anything. I still have moments of immense dizziness, nausea and panic. Feeling like I‚Äôm going to pass out but also run a mile. It‚Äôs crazy. I‚Äôm writing this now because I just had one of these moments for no reason. I keep thinking I‚Äôm deathly ill or something!!

I don‚Äôt know what to do, does anyone else have a similar experience? Any advice? Anything at all that might help me out."

I am much better now on local roads, and merging off / on 95, 295 etc. I lived in noVA aka the DMV area for years and am now relocated in Williamsburg. (Much quieter and less cars) üòä but yeah still never getting on 66. Too many drivers and ppl are nuts. 

I wanted to reach out to y‚Äôall about rides/roller coasters @ theme parks-  how does everyone feel about them while having anxiety? 

I get motion sickness easily sometimes so roller coasters + the lump in your throat feeling is a no go üôÖüèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èfor me. 

But I have tried to do rides recently in the least few years, like the drop zone, and those üòµ‚Äçüí´ spinning swings and after each of those rides, I felt a headache, dizzy and a little weak in my knees and whole lower body, hands shaking too :/ anyone else experience this or just me? 

I don‚Äôt know if those symptoms occurred just BECAUSE of my anxiety or it‚Äôs something else. Hope I‚Äôm not alone in feeling this way üò©thnx in advance."

Haven‚Äôt had a friend in 6 years n I can‚Äôt believe my anxiety literally affects my ability to even be on the fucking internet. This should be easier. But knowing that they‚Äôre my age is terrifying, because frankly I‚Äôve only had bad experiences with other teens. Abandonment, toxicity, manipulation, you name it. If it were anywhere else I‚Äôd probably be more okay, but I don‚Äôt want it to be somewhere else cause I want a friend my age. But the anxiety paradox shows up every fucking time. I want a friend but I don‚Äôt want a friend because it‚Äôs too much work, I‚Äôm too anxious and they‚Äôre probably gonna abandon me anyways üëç

At times I would just sit outside and wait for it to pass. It was a horrible two years. I was also out on beta blockers and have not been able to come off since. Lately I have been freaking out because I notice that when I eat my hr is 97-100 sitting. But since I work it gets up to the 130‚Äôs if I get up and walk.

There‚Äôs no such thing as being behind in life or being behind in society‚Ä¶the only things along those lines that are real are social constructs, societal bias and comformity, generational trauma, closed-mindedness, desperation for validation from other people, the illusion of superiority in the form of unnecessary, unwanted, and unasked for judgement, the fear the government specifically designs to control the people to get more money and power, peer pressure, and unhealthy perfectionism. Don‚Äôt be a sheep, allow yourself to be a unique, beautifully imperfect human‚Ä¶life has no set schedule or manual, so stop comparing yourself to others. Don‚Äôt be afraid to be different or go against the societal/social norm. Learn to be okay with being controversial, and unlearn society‚Äôs unrealistic standards. You‚Äôre uniquely you. It‚Äôs not your job to keep everyone else happy. However it is your job to keep your peace and to do what‚Äôs best for your life, your plans, and your mental health‚Ä¶even if it upsets people. You‚Äôre worth it. Stop caring about what other people think of you and other people‚Äôs opinions‚Ä¶they‚Äôre just that, opinions. It‚Äôs time to stop fearing other people, they‚Äôre only human, just like you, with their own flaws and challenges and personal hells to go through. If something doesn‚Äôt affect you, just shut up about it and don‚Äôt butt into other people‚Äôs business. It‚Äôs not your life, it‚Äôs theirs, and you‚Äôre not them. And to incorrectly assume you know exactly what someone might be going through or what it‚Äôll take to cut them into one of society‚Äôs boring, sheep, conformist cookies, is just so wrong and sad and pathetic on so many levels. Again, you‚Äôre not them, you‚Äôre not in their mind, you‚Äôre not in their situation, so shut up about things you know nothing about, doesn‚Äôt matter if they‚Äôre friends or family. It‚Äôll just make things worse if you judge and assume. And things you say literally have the ability to stick with people and rewire their brains and change their brain chemistry, so don‚Äôt be the reason people start thinking that they‚Äôre not enough or even the reason they start considering unaliving themself. Be the opposite. Perfection doesn‚Äôt and will never exist, no matter what society says. Fuck society and their unrealistic, engineered standards. Don‚Äôt add to society‚Äôs toxicity, half of them don‚Äôt deserve the time of day. Your imperfections are beautiful. Additonally, always try to spread love, positivity, understanding, unconditional support, and empathy wherever and whenever you can, you never know what someone else might be going through and you could even be the person to restore their faith in humanity üíñ

I‚Äôm proud of you, and you should be proud of yourself too, even for the baby steps. Some progress is better than no progress at all, ignore the haters and don‚Äôt let them put you back to square one‚Ä¶and don‚Äôt let them make you even think that you‚Äôre back at square one when they‚Äôre not you and don‚Äôt have your mind or your experiences, it‚Äôs not their life, and they have no right to judge your progress, especially when I know half of your progress most people are too blind to see‚Ä¶I see your progress, and you‚Äôre doing absolutely amazing üòä

18wwnn0,Anxiety,2024-01-02,Stress and anxiety manifesting physically,"I‚Äôm under a lot of stress recently. Burnt out from work and eventually resigned. Right now I venturing into a new career (which if I fail to make work would be the end of me‚Äîliterally) and it really makes me even more anxious. 

Since then I‚Äôve been üí© at least 4-5 times a day, even though I haven‚Äôt been eating as much as I used to. In fact, I lost appetite a couple of days ago. I can‚Äôt get a good 7-8 hours sleep, been only sleeping 4 hours at most. My heart‚Äôs always racing, hands are trembling‚Äîand just yesterday, I have been feeling nauseous which led to vomitting. Because I haven‚Äôt been eating much, I only puked water. 

I took some medications for the nausea but the sleeplessness, irritability, trembling hands, loose bowel, and heart pounding still persist. 

I want to get checked by a healthcare professional but I‚Äôm not sure which one since I‚Äôm pretty aware that I have both physical and mental concerns right now. I believe the physical symptoms I‚Äôm having are a result of stress and anxiety and it‚Äôs making it hard for me to concentrate and do the things I need to do. I live in a place where healthcare isn‚Äôt cheap so seeing a doctor for each is not possible at the moment considering I have just resigned from my job as well. 

PS. I am not clinically diagnosed with anxiety. But I do think the last few weeks have made me really anxious and stressed out."

18wwjj3,Anxiety,2024-01-02,Anxious about my actions and having anxiety thinking I burned bridges. Please help.,"Hi everyone - 

Writing this because I am struggling so hard today that I literally didn‚Äôt know who else to turn to. Though, this is clearly making me think I need to find a therapist STAT (long overdue but that‚Äôs a different story). 

So here‚Äôs the situation. 

I play a lot of volleyball. 5-6 days a week. I‚Äôm very involved and know a lot of people in the community. I sign up for a lot of tournaments and a lot of open gyms / practices. Well over the Christmas holiday I started to get very depressed (something happened with a volleyball friend that turned out they weren‚Äôt really a friends and it really triggered me) and I started having really bad anxiety and I was coping with it by sleeping a lot. I kept saying fuck that friend I‚Äôm just quitting playing and became super dramatic about it but then became very depressed. 

During that time I missed two volleyball tournaments.  I never told the person organizing it that I wasn‚Äôt coming. I ghosted. I admit it.  Because of the ghosting I then stopped responding to everyone. I stopped answering texts and Facebook messages and I ended up missing a third tournament because I ghosted those people again. 

As I‚Äôm coming out of my depressive funk, I‚Äôm now realizing I may have burnt bridges. I may have lost friends. I may have ruined my name in the volleyball community. 

But I don‚Äôt want to quit. It‚Äôs the only thing that has brought me a sense of community, it‚Äôs my reason for getting out of the house, it‚Äôs my favorite thing to do and I‚Äôm good at it and I feel good about myself when I do it. And now I‚Äôm worried I have nothing left and I‚Äôve burnt it all to the ground. I don‚Äôt know what to do. I talked to my sister and she said to respond to the messages and just tell people you were sick and she seemed to think people would be forgiving. I‚Äôm so terrified to open my messages and to have to read those messages but I also want my life back. These depressive episodes ruin everything for me. I self sabotage during them all the time. I don‚Äôt want to give up my favorite hobby but I‚Äôm not sure I can bring myself to read the messages and respond. 

Any advice? Any advice on how to respond if I do read them? Should I just take my entire Facebook down? 

Thank you in advance."

3 years ago I told my mom a HUGE lie, that I had graduated from college( and later on that I got a good job. In fact I dropped out and I've been living as a NEET ever since, using some money I got from an inheritance. Not much but I eat and live like shit. 

My mom came to visit at Christmas and will be leaving soon. I need to tell her the truth before that but I can't. If I even think about it I start to feel physically ill and can't breathe.

We aren't rich and I have no siblings or dad so me wasting my life is a huge deal to her. I told lies on top of lies on top of lies to sustain that first lie, coming clean about it is just too much. I've thought about checking myself into a mental hospital but I read so many horror stories about them online that I'm too scared to do it.

Does anyone have any tips about coming clean about a huge lie like that?"
18wwi3k,Anxiety,2024-01-02,Unending focus on body symptoms,"Hi all,

Most of my anxiety has to do with negative feelings in my body. Upset stomach, bloated feeling, increased heart rate. Essentially everything that happens when you go to the gym or are anxious.

It seems that some feeling can trigger anxiety and create more feelings. 
Usually I can do my things when the feelings are not too overwhelming. I'm not having any triggering thoughts, other then that I don't want/like the feeling.

Today was one day that I struggled to get trough, because I couldn't stop focussing on the anxiety symptoms I was feeling. And because of that I obviously increased it.

I know CBT and ACT, and they help to some degree.

Does anyone have relatable experiences and or tips?
Even the obvious ones are welcome."

But the person who does this is inhuman, it‚Äôs like a caricature of a perfect person. I do not want to be perfect, I just want to be normal. Everyone around me engages in sensual pleasures but my anxiety wants me to force myself to not even touch these things. Let alone the palpitations and tightness in my stomach and other physical symptoms which arise every time, the guilt alone is unsurvivable. I hate this disease, it has ruined every waking moment of my life. Sometimes I wish I had cancer instead of spending each second fearing it.

18wvp73,Anxiety,2024-01-02,Random Nauseating Panic Attacks,"Hi all,

Since graduating college and recently starting a new job at an investment bank, working long, intense, hours, I‚Äôve noticed a major uptick in my anxiety. I‚Äôve been diagnosed previously with GAD, Bipolar, and ADHD. I‚Äôve been on Seroquel for Bipolar and it works great. However, I‚Äôve noticed throughout the day I get these random panic attacks that I never experienced until I started working. My hands start to sweat, my heart races, my vision gets sort of disoriented, and I get an intense feeling of nausea. I notice it especially in meetings or when talking to a superior one-on-one. Or it can be completely random. I had one bad episode of dry heaving in the bathroom and seeing hallucination patterns that I had to leave work, later ended up calling paramedics because I was convinced I was going to have a heart attack (I didn‚Äôt, it showed me how it is all in my head). My psychiatrist now has me on klonopin as needed, usually ends up being 0.5-2mg daily, but she says this cannot go on forever as Klonopin‚Äôs side effects are heavy. I live a healthy lifestyle outside of work (MMA 6x a week [never feel anxious at the gym luckily], eat very healthy, get 7 hours of sleep at least, quit caffeine). I don‚Äôt know what to do at this point. I know it is all mental, but I can‚Äôt keep popping klonopin like candy, especially when it doesn‚Äôt even work 100%. Any advice? Any meds I should try?

Please and thank you."

18wuw88,Anxiety,2024-01-02,Anxiety or Health Issue,"Hi Forum,  


I wanted to post about my current situation and see if anyone in this community had any thoughts regarding my recent health spell.   


I have been dealing with shortness of breath / racing heart which made it difficult to fall asleep for about a year now. I had an EKG done in February with everything coming back positive. This past summer, I had an episode where I thought I was having an allergic reaction (throat and stomach swelling, heart pounding, and very close to fainting), however the EMT said my oxygen levels were near 100%. I had 2 other episodes over the next 2 days and was admitted into the ER for 3 days straight. An EKG and blood work was done and nothing came back concerning. I saw my doctor in September and he did my vitals/ blood work which also came back fine. I have not had an episode since but am still living in discomfort since this summer from the symptoms below:  


\-Shortness of Breath (Especially when exercising or having long conversations)  
\-(Occasionally) Impending Feeling of Doom when lying down and trying to sleep   
\-Discomfort in left sternum (Vagnus Nerve?)  
\-Blood Pressure is usually in the high 120s - high 130s  
\-Racing Heart

18wuvrd,Anxiety,2024-01-02,Problem with sounds that muffle or limit awareness of my surrounding?,"I don't have problem with the sound or noise per se so it's probably not phonophobia. It's just that I can't keep those sounds running for long‚Äî like tapwater while I'm in the bathroom, fan on full speed or loud music (I mostly use only one side of my earphone) because I don't like being not able to sense or hear what's happening in the surrounding beyond. Like what if someone's approaching my door, or calling, or if something's not right in the neighborhood. It doesn't affect me terribly but there's surely some discomfort.

Does that sound like hypervigilance? Does anyone else feel that way?"

if i go to bed at 12am, i wake up at 5am
if i go to bed at 10pm, i wake up at 3am

i need 7 hours of sleep to feel normal

when i wake up at the 5 hour mark, i cannot go back to sleep unless i wait 2 hours OR eat a banana.

is this anxiety?

i thought it was a low blood sugar problem but last night i set my alarm to wake me up at the 4.5hr mark and then i drank a bottle of coconut water. i was actually not even able to fall back asleep after that until like 7am, unfuckingbelievable.

this is telling me it may not be sugar related but i still think it might be high cortisol‚Ä¶ or anxiety?

has anyone experienced this before?

this has been going on for 2 years and it started happening AFTER i lost 40lbs, was eating healthy everyday and was running everyday. this is ruining my life. sigh."
18wuf8l,Anxiety,2024-01-02,How to get off autopilot and feel real again?,"Hey there, I‚Äôm gonna get straight to the point, basically I‚Äôve been disassociated the whole of last year, went through a really bad rut, I‚Äôm doing good now and can never go back, but it really still frustrates me that I am still disassociated. It‚Äôs not as bad as last year but I still struggle to feel fully in the moment and enjoy everything like I used to. Sometimes I partially latch on with smells and sensations, but I genuinely have not felt present and clear for a whole year now. I previously had been through a terrible anxiety phase too, I could not order speak to store clerks or anyone without breaking down, so I now believe this disassociation is a coping mechanism for anxiety that possibly got worse without me noticing.

I had a great time, and actually made a move on a girl that I've had feelings for for a while now. Things went great, and she agreed to go on a date with me today. The only problem is that my ""hangxiety"" has been insane. I'm feeling a little better today, but yesterday was horrific. Constant anxiety all day long and finally 1 panic attack in the evening that lasted about 20 minutes. I'm so worried that I'm going to give myself a panic attack on this date and ruin everything.

And people there are always posting educational content like they know everything and you don‚Äôt even know if people actually KNOW their stuff or are trying to sound professional. It‚Äôs really anxiety inducing but I need it and will eventually need to post there but it all feels so fake.

18wsw3m,Anxiety,2024-01-02,Need some support,"I‚Äôve made some major progress in my anxiety over the last couple months, with the help of groups like this, a therapist, and some lifestyle changes. There‚Äôs one last hurdle I can‚Äôt seem to jump, and that‚Äôs being alone. Not like the doomed feeling of being alone forever (I‚Äôm married, I have children, I live close to family), but I‚Äôm a stay at home mom and my husband works long shifts. The thought of being home alone, with or without my kids, literally makes my skin crawl. I keep trying to make it through the day but every single time I have to have someone come over to be with me.

I don‚Äôt know how to get past this, but I am so so tired of it. Anybody been in this situation before? I know that it stems from my health anxiety, and since anxiety is so physical when I start to get the symptoms I worry that there‚Äôs a medical cause and that something is going to happen to me with no other adult around to help.

18wsvka,Anxiety,2024-01-02,Can anxiety cause inattentiveness?,"Okay so I've had problems with inattentiveness, procrastination and focus for a long ass time. I've never committed to a thing for a longer period of time, it's not like I get bored or anything it's just that the moment I realise I'll have to put efforts and become better to pursue something (studying or hobby doesn't matter) I immediately give up. 

Procrastination has been a big fucking problem for my entire life. People say that I'm an above average student but that's only because I can grasp the knowledge quicker. If I didn't have that ability I'd be several grades behind. I literally cannot bring myself to read no matter how hard I try. When I clear my time, sit down try to not have any distractions- Wait my nails are too long, let me cut them... Oof now my hands are too dry let me use lotion... Now they're too sweaty let me clean them... This place is too warm let's switch on the AC- Nope now it's too cold, let's wear a sweater, now I feel itchy- 

I've seen people complain about not being able to focus on studying or work. But what about hobbies? Hell even a small article about gardening I CANNOT BRING MYSELF TO READ IT FULLY. I can feel my stomach burning with impatience I wish I had the ability to copy text or videos within one second or some shit lol. Ugh it's been a big problem for me for a very long time.

18wrpt2,Anxiety,2024-01-02,Zoloft withdrawal?,"Hello all, on 2 Dec 2023 I was prescribed 50mg of Zoloft per day for my health anxiety. The first day I took 25 mg and I had a severe reaction to it - insomnia, severe dizziness, very bad headaches, nausea, bad mood etc. So due to this, I decided to start with 12.5 mg. For the next few days I was taking just 12.5 mg but for some reason I was having the same severe effects. I took my last dose on the 6th of December when I just couldn't take it anymore and decided to stop it. A week after I started getting these weird ice pick headaches which were very weird (I normally don't get headaches). After that I started getting other symptoms which were almost the same as when I was on Zoloft - dizzy spells, nausea, irritability, insomnia, all of which remain till now. I called up my prescribing physician and he told me that it is impossible that these symptoms are withdrawals as I was taking it for too short amount of time and it is likely rebound anxiety.
This is very weird because a couple of years ago I was prescribed Zoloft again for the same reason (50mg each day) however back then I had no side effects when I was starting it. Additionally, I was feeling pretty good on it back then and I took it for an year and had no issues stopping it (tapered off and had no withdrawals). 
For the record, on the 15 Nov 2023 I had a full body medical examination (blood work, cardio etc.) and everything was perfect. 
So my question is whether it is possible that I am experiencing withdrawals or side effects from taking it just for 4 days? My anxiety has never caused me such symptoms even on my worst days. Thanks in advance!"

Getting a shot or my blood drawn doesn't freak me out... it's the results I will get after that make me anxious. Maybe because I fear death, not sure. Growing up I kinda ate unhealthy but nothing crazy, just a kid being a kid, but my mom use to always say ""you're gonna get cancer from these things"" which engrained into my head and freaked me out.

190jn3m,Anxiety,2024-01-07,Fear of bowl / colon cancer,"So, for several months I've had binge eating problems, where I eat too much and then usually skip dinner. I end up having discomfort, to the point it persists into the next day, there hasn't been any extreme weight-related gain either. My stomach will remain sore and feel full even an entire day after eating.

My great uncle died of bowl cancer in 2004, at around age 70. I'm terrified, these symptoms have been going on for months, to the point I can't drink alcohol and have to stop just before drunkness is induced. My stomach just feels full and sore all the time. I've cut back my food intake and aligned with a fairly normal diet for the last day or two, but it hasn't worked. I still feel full and sore.

My doctor examined my stomach a few months ago, pressed down on it, and blood tests were conducted, all were negative. I stopped thinking about this for the most part, but my stomach hasn't improved and became worse and worse as the binge-eating worsened. It obviously has improve, but hasn't seemed to make a difference. My stools vary from thin to large, dark and light, sometimes with Mucus but no blood for the last few weeks. I always feel ill, bloated, full, and even nauseous.

I've cried wolf far too often now, so Mum won't believe me. I am due for a medical check-up soon, but I'm concerned for the worst."
190jcap,Anxiety,2024-01-07,I‚Äôm so sick of health anxiety.,"It all started in 2018 when I was depressed and my doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin. It worked great for a few weeks until we upped my dose, where I began having severe panic attacks that lasted basically 24/7 until we switched to Zoloft. I‚Äôm not sure why Wellbutrin did this to me, but it was the catalyst for panic attacks. I had never truly had one before, but it terrified me. I was certain I was dying. Ever since then, I struggle with major health anxiety because I‚Äôve never quite felt normal since that time. It‚Äôs like a switch flipped in my brain and caused permanent damage. I now have panic attacks fairly regularly and I‚Äôm so scared that doctors are missing something vital. In the last several years, I‚Äôve been obsessively seeing my doctor and luckily managed to stop myself and I haven‚Äôt been since September. But I can‚Äôt get over the feeling that somethings seriously wrong with me and my doctors are ignoring it. I often get told I‚Äôm ‚Äúonly 30‚Äù so the likelihood of something being wrong isn‚Äôt high. But I guess to my demise, I spend a lot of time scrollling TikTok and seeing tons of young women my age being diagnosed with late stage cancers that were dismissed as anxiety. I fucking hate this. Every ache and pain in my body is a nightmare. I‚Äôll overthink it for months. In September, I had a breast lump checked via ultrasound and they told me it was nothing but my armpit lymph node was ‚Äúthickened‚Äù (whatever that means) but the doctors weren‚Äôt concerned. Does anyone else experience this? I feel literally insane. For awhile I obsessed over enlarged lymph nodes in my neck that turned out to just be my fucking salivary glands."
190isvv,Anxiety,2024-01-07,Tormenting myself everyday over something that happened 20 years ago and was out of my control.,"First I must start saying that I love animals, I am a vet and working with them is literally what keeps me alive. The last years I have developed extreme sensibility to anything that includes animal suffering or cruelty. I deal with BPD so most of the time these feelings are overwhelming enough to make me feel dizzy and like fainting. 

Anyway, when I was a kid, around 20 years ago, I witnessed a car rolling over a stray dog, while other stray dog ran after the car because its friend was being dragged by the wheel. At the moment this was bad but I think my mind blocked this memory, until about a year ago when someone was telling me a similar experience and this memory came to my mind, I felt so bad to the point I almost fainted, I blame myself over it because I think why I didn‚Äôt yell to the car, why didn‚Äôt I stop it, why I did nothing. The logical part of me thinks I was a kid but, I still feel extremely bad, this disturbing memory comes to my mind at nights and I‚Äôm unable to sleep, I just cry and cry and feel as if my chest is being burnt. At the moment I cannot go to therapy because I‚Äôm not in my country and receiving therapy in a different language doesn‚Äôt work for me. I would like advice on how can I rationalize this or at least, let it go and stop blaming myself over it, the burden of this memory is just too much for me. English is not my first language so I‚Äôm sorry for any mistakes, and thank you in advance."

190d4wo,Anxiety,2024-01-06,Mental Health,"Can social anxiety cause you to ramble and say things that are not true. Sometimes when I‚Äôm having a conversation I will randomly say something that‚Äôs not true, but when I‚Äôm saying it I think it is. I‚Äôm not trying to lie or meaning to say something that‚Äôs not true. I wanna stop doing it but don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs even causing it. It‚Äôs making me feel like a horrible person and making me feel like a ‚Äúliar‚Äù. I recently just did it again and it‚Äôs all I have been thinking about.

190c6l2,Anxiety,2024-01-06,Whats wrong with my heart?,"Maybe nothing. Maybe something. Idk. 

So I‚Äôve been pretty inactive for this entire year. Most days not even getting in 1000 steps. I‚Äôve put weight on too not sure if that just from being inactive or from a health issue (I have some other issues/concerns). 

My heart races from pretty much anything. My resting rate is anywhere from 75-95. If I‚Äôm relaxed in bed if usually 70 something. Once I get up it usually goes up like 30 beats. I‚Äôve noticed that when I stand it won‚Äôt go below like 100ish and I don‚Äôt like that at all. Any exercise makes it go up a ton. Walking it‚Äôs usually around 120. If I go up stairs it can hit 150. If I carry heavy things it can hit 160 or higher, highest it hit is 180. This is really affecting me because I feel like I can‚Äôt do anything. I usually have to sit down to try and calm it dow. I get it, it‚Äôs my fault for being so  inactive but I‚Äôm just trying to make sure I‚Äôm okay. 

I want to be active and exercise but when my heart rate gets high like that it makes me feel sick. Sometimes it‚Äôll make me feel like I‚Äôm going to have a panic attack when obviously I‚Äôm not. I just don‚Äôt know how to lower my rate so I can actually do things. I shoveled outside earlier and my heart rate was pretty much between 140-150 the entire time. I hate this so much. I used to be so active and have so much fun outside. Now I dread just getting up because I hate the way it feels with my heart racing while I‚Äôm literally standing doing nothing. I literally feel like I‚Äôm killing myself and I really want to change that. 

If you‚Äôre going to comment about health anxiety please don‚Äôt comment. I‚Äôm not anxious over my heart beat I‚Äôm just wondering if it‚Äôs all my inactivity or if something more could be going on. I also don‚Äôt constantly check it sometimes I can just really feel my heart beating and I usually check to make sure it‚Äôs not beating to fast. At 180 I start to feel like I‚Äôll pass out."

18yjr3e,Anxiety,2024-01-04,feels impossible recovering,"last year was one of the worst years i‚Äôve experienced mentally so naturally this year i made it a goal do do what‚Äôs best for my mind and it‚Äôs easier said than done. i‚Äôve gained a lot of wisdom and advice throughout last year after such and uphill battle with anxiety/depression/adhd and it was a huge learning experience. i recieved lots of advice from my therapist and learned a lot about myself and the way anxiety affects me, or what happens leading up to me dealing with anxiety/stress/depression but my anxious mind literally feels impenetrable. 

i feel like i cannot think differently or do whats best for my body or my mind because of the way i‚Äôve gotten so used the comfort that my anxiety provides, even though it‚Äôs so stress inducing. even if it does result in me reaching ‚Äúsuccess‚Äù. it feels like falling to a cushion safeguarding my fall yet being shot at all the way down. however if i do reach success, there will be a lot of blame for ever have been doing it so anxiously

i‚Äôm mainly referring to my overthinking which is the worst thing i‚Äôm a victim to. for example, i feel like my mental capacity overall sucks, so i tend to overthink a lot. when i overthink, i‚Äôll remind myself not to but then i‚Äôll feel like if i don‚Äôt, i‚Äôll dissociate and start to under think which makes me feel like i need to rely on the anxious overthinking which always ends up giving me a huge headache

anyways, it seems i can‚Äôt do anything mentally correct for myself and it‚Äôs getting really tough. i know what to do and how to do it but i just can‚Äôt. i‚Äôm too prone to my comfort zone and i‚Äôm not sure how to stop. it sucks because i‚Äôm so self aware about it all and i wish i wasn‚Äôt. nothing i do anxiously is something i can ever just slide right off. i hold all these negative beliefs of myself too which make me feel like i can‚Äôt achieve stress free success. i don‚Äôt even know if i make sense. i don‚Äôt even think writing this post is good for me. anxiety fucking sucks"

18xu7c3,Anxiety,2024-01-03,New job and imposter syndrome,"Apologies for the wall of text, my head is pretty busy right now

I'm in a profession where a three year degree is required. My course wasn't very good and we essentially had to learn on placement, but I had rough luck with placements. I failed my final one but passed the repeat because I had a nicer supervisor and could actually learn (I felt my other supervisor was a bully)

I think this really contributes to my imposter syndrome

I've just got a static post after being on rotations for 2.5 years. Basically I spent that time doing my job in three different places to gain experience

Now on Friday I am starting a static job where I'll be permanent in one place

I know that having over two years experience should mean I'll be good and confident but I really don't feel that. Because it was in different areas I feel like it doesn't consolidate and I only actually have 9 months experience in the area I'm returning to

Since I was hired the senior of my position has left so I'll be the only one of me in the place and this has my imposter syndrome in overdrive

I feel like I know nothing and my incompetence won't be shielded by having a senior to work with or run things past like I always have had 

There are so many unknowns and I don't know who will give me supervision (1:1s) or who will be my manager

I have also relocated for this role and moved in on Monday and I keep thinking if the job goes horribly I've uprooted my life for it and could be left with nothing

How do I handle this fear of being a fuck up and being found out? I feel like because the senior has left and my post has been empty for ages that they'll really be counting on me and I'll fuck up. I interview really well and I feel like there will be high hopes for my arrival

What do I do?"

OCD I‚Äôve been officially diagnosed with since around 14-15. This is one of the first times I‚Äôm unmedicated in years, due to the fact that most of the medications have given me annoying side effects that make it hard and there‚Äôs not many more options. These last two weeks have been so hard. I was in literal crisis for a bit of it. I do think I‚Äôve made little progress and then I just take a stepback. Im also an insomniac so the little sleep does not help my case. I do have sleep meds but my anxiety does not let me take them due to fear, even though I‚Äôve taken them several times before. I‚Äôm in therapy now and it‚Äôs given me a bit of relief but we haven‚Äôt been able to meet in the last week or two and I don‚Äôt think I have another appointment til next week. 

I‚Äôm just tired. Today I accidentally sent a rude text to my boss because of having a migraine and being so on edge from my anxiety for it. I apologized and she hasn‚Äôt responded and I can‚Äôt stop panicking. I only got a few hours off so I have to go in and I‚Äôm so anxious I feel like I‚Äôm going to vomit, which obviously has not helped my migraine. Work is super stressful. I work reception at a therapy office and am often the front line crisis responder when nobody is available and it‚Äôs super hard to deal with when you‚Äôre already anxious yourself and zero training.

I just want a hug. I don‚Äôt like being touched usually due to contamination but I just want somebody to reach out to me and tell me it will be okay and to just give me a hug. I want to feel safe and loved.

22/yo Female here. For as long as I can remember I have struggled with health anxiety (mainly heart related) but includes other things too. I think it began at age 8 or so and has become better or worse sporadically over the years. I struggled really badly at age 12 ish for a while after a girl in my class had a seizure. It got to the point where I couldn‚Äôt even go to school because I was terrified that I too would have a seizure. Eventually this fizzled out and I think I was anxiety free for a couple of years however it has come back with vengeance over the past year, and I am so so disappointed to be starting 2024 hiding in my bed while on a ski trip with friends because I am too terrified to ski due to heart related worries. (Side note: my toe is also broken which is an inconvenience but I could definitely manage to ski on it as the pain is minimal. However I am now using my broken toe as an excuse to hide in the room). My heart was racing like crazy last night and I couldn‚Äôt sleep and mentioned it to my friend this morning thinking that she would say ‚Äúoh yeah I get that sometimes‚Äù but she was like ‚ÄúNo I‚Äôve never had that‚Äù. I reckon it‚Äôs simply a symptom of anxiety itself. I quit my favourite sport this year because I felt like I was experiencing dizziness during it, and I think it has really taken a toll on my mental health as it has caused weight gain and I used to struggle with an ED (but that‚Äôs a whole other story). I could say so much more about all of this but please if anyone has any advice on how to manage HA as I cannot live like this anymore, it is paralysing and it consumes so much of my thoughts and life."

all was good. we moved in August, my life went on, I studied and met new people. my mother always dreamed of moving to this city. my grandparents stayed in a city two hours from mine. my grandfather is very sick. two weeks ago I heard my uncle say that he would probably die soon. and then it hit me. first, the realization of his possible death came to me, then the realization of the move, then memories from my childhood, from our family‚Äôs home, when we were all together, began to pop up in my head. just 7 years ago. it amazed me

For a week now I have been waking up and going to sleep with the fear of losing my mother. Now she supports us alone and rents an apartment. in the next few years she wants to save up for our own apartment here. 
I can‚Äôt eat, I can‚Äôt get out of bed, I can‚Äôt sleep, I‚Äôm shaking and pictures of the past flash before my eyes. I cry, I cry, I look at my mother and cry again. I can't come to terms with reality. I can't come to terms with the fact that I've grown up. I can‚Äôt accept that the only people who live for me and for who I live for will one day die.

There are a  lot of issues in my family which trigger my anxiety. Most of the energy of my family members goes towards my sibling because of their recently diagnosed mental health issues I understand my family's situation but no matter how much I try I feel like I'm not needed and am no ones priority. But this post is not about that. I have always felt safe in my home and that's the only place that gives me any sort of warmth or comfort. After the pandemic, my family decided to put the house up for sale and throughout that period i felt constantly depressed and low. This went on for a year until they decided to put it off the market. The relief that I felt then,, I cannot explain it in words. But today I overheard my parents talking about someone coming over to have a look at the place and when I asked my mum about it she refused to give me any clarity. Now I'm paranoid that they might have put the house on the market again. My heart sinks every time something like this comes up. My home is the only thing/place that I'm attached to and feel at ease in. The issues in my family as well as my past experiences with friends have never allowed to be comfortable with anyone and I am extremely attached to this tangible property. I don't know if I'm being selfish by pushing my family again and again to not sell the house. But that's the only thing I believe I have. I'm scared to confront them about it and don't know what to do. I feel powerless and as if nothing is in my control.

I believe that I am scared of change but I don't know how to cope with it. Situations like these push me down a rabbit hole. I constantly feel like I'm not needed or wanted anywhere and that's the reason why I try to find that comfort at home where I can be myself, with my self.

Is it necessary to completely quit or will dramatically lowering my intake (e.g replacing coffee with a diet coke) have positive effects on my anxiety?

18wlbba,Anxiety,2024-01-02,Feel like I can‚Äôt deal with it no more,"So I‚Äôve had anxiety pretty much all my life but since Covid it has escalated pretty bad. 

After returning to work from lockdown I ended up going on the sick for almost 6 months due to having chest pains every day, turns out it was panic attacks. I got given sertraline which I felt didn‚Äôt help and then beta blockers to help with the physical symptoms which don‚Äôt help. 

Everything now just seems like a struggle. At work I struggle and feel like walking out. Today I feel like breaking down. I cant do simple stuff that I used to like doing. 

I‚Äôve been struggling with this now for three years and the only thing that really keeps me going are my children, which after spending all Christmas with and now I‚Äôm back at work has made my anxiety escalate even further. 

Countless times I‚Äôve been tempted to quit work and take my kids out of nursery so I would be eligible for some help from the government as they are 2 and 3 but I can‚Äôt pull my self to take them away from there as they enjoy it so much. 

I‚Äôm pretty much at a loss and tearing up writing this and don‚Äôt know what to do anymore."
18w5823,Anxiety,2024-01-01,Bad Weed High? Or Psychosis? Crippling Lingering Anxiety,"Hey guys I am 21 year old male, no mental health history in family.

I took a bunch of delta 8 edibles unfortunately and got really high.

I was playing fortnite with my friends and then took my headphones off and heard distant voices and footsteps I couldn't make out what they were saying (I live in an apartment complex and drank a monster). 
When I put my headphones back on I couldn't hear them.

I then went to go to bed and could not tell if what I was hearing was coming from my head or apartment noise I was also really high. 

It was pretty scary in the moment.
No visual side effects, lingering side effects after the high or delusional side effects. I felt completely normal the next day.

My doctor believes I did not experience psychosis.

I am scared this will comeback or become something chronic. I keep googling horror stories about psychosis and now I have crippling anxiety and panic attacks.

Thanks in advance.
I hope y'all had a Merry Christmas."
18wkygu,Anxiety,2024-01-02,"""Peripheral Vision "" anxiety","So I'm wondering how common this issue is. I'm 22, but since I was around 17 maybe, I've had what I'm calling ""Peripheral Vision anxiety. "" Basically if someone is in my peripheral vision, I get anxious that they're looking at me, or that they think I'm looking at them. It gradually gets worse, until I leave the situation, but if I return, I won't be able to stop thinking about it, and it will continue. It feels pretty similar to an intrusive thought. I've had a similar issue once, where I was talking to this girl with big boobs. It's ridiculous. I didn't want to look at her boobs, so I mentally tried to be certain that I would not do that, but then I become paranoid that I actually am looking at her boobs. And then I'm worrying what I must look like to her. 

It seems goofy, but this sort of thing was quite debilitating. I still don't leave the house much, but this issue made it difficult to be around a lot of people, like while watching a movie, or eating with family at the dining table. I'm now on antidepressants, which have helped, along with therapy, though I still have this a bit, it's just not quite as bad.

But I'm curious, do you guys relate?"
18wkvto,Anxiety,2024-01-02,Struggling with social interaction with my closest friends,"Happy new years everyone! This post is just a summary of my (23M) thoughts after I‚Äôve been noticing some weird behavior in myself recently. Would appreciate any advice on the matter.

To start, it was New Year's Eve and I went out to the bars with my friends, who I would say I'm very close with (Hang out with them multiple times a week). Additionally there were some other people who I admittedly didn't know as well, but they were still friendly and had a good idea of who I was. The night started and when we got to the bar, I would say I was at a very low level of drunk (probably 2/10 on a scale), since I didn't feel like drinking too heavily at the pregame. 

For some more added context, at the pregame (my house) I was mostly to myself and only really talked to my closest 1 or 2 friends when I had the chance. I felt more comfortable sitting alone in the other room or finding a random task to do (i.e. cleaning up some small trash pieces off the floor), and didn't feel very inclined to mingle with some of the newer people in the group. Also, I'm generally a friendly, approachable, and caring person.

So when we got to the bar, I just generally felt awkward and that I was in my head too much; I can't really dance so I didn't really have great energy/vibes with the rest of the group, and the thought of socializing with people felt like a task. Fast forwarding a bit, I got some drinks in me and then the regular enjoyable feeling of being with my friends commenced as it usually is with alcohol (no surprise), and we had a fun New Year's Eve. 

Later on we ended up at another friend's house where we hung out a bit longer, eventually ending up on the couch for conversation. I was sitting there taking everything in and trying to participate in conversation where I could, but eventually felt annoyed and that I wasn't very engaged in what was happening. After a while I left the room to go sit by the kitchen countertop and nobody really said anything so I was just bored, sitting there. I had a random thought enter my head which was to go outside and just take in the quiet air, and be to myself. I ended up just laying on the concrete driveway looking up at the sky, feeling chilly but at peace knowing I was out of that environment for a bit. I listened to some music on my phone, and after a bit my friends came looking for me.

Part of me wanted my friends to dart out and ask where I was; for them to give me attention perhaps. However the other part of me was just enjoying the serenety of the night sky (it was between 3-5am so I could ahve also just been very tired, being the cause of this behavior). After being there for a while I came back in, and returned to the couch. I stayed and talked a bit but eventually the same looming feeling of uncomfortability came over me and I felt compelled to go back outside, to my safe concrete haven in the driveway. I did the same thing again, and my friend came out in a panic wondering what happened/where I was. 

This is a lot of potentially unnecessary context for me to pose the questions: Does this behavior exhibit signs of social anxiety? Am I experiencing spotlight effect? Why do I feel  uncomfortable at times around my friends when I know and love these guys? I feel often intimidated when I'm in a larger group of people; it's harder to be myself and blend in to the conversation. 

My hunch is that I'm in my head too much overanalyzing things when I should cease the thinking as often, and just be apart of the moment. However for me that seems hard since I have such an analytical mind. Overall my wish is to just be more comfortable and not awkward in normal social interactions, and it puzzles me that recently I haven't felt as inclined to be outwardly social with my friends who I already know so well. Any thoughts on this story, my behavior, or what you guys think would be greatly appreciated! Thanks so much if you read this far and have a great one!"
18wkojl,Anxiety,2024-01-02,I feel like I am trapped,I feel like I am trapped and drowning i just had a panic attack yesterday and i can still feel it in my body today. I am stuck and i cannot even shout or scream . Every thing seems meaningless. To be honest I don't know what to do also with my semester coming it just feels all too much the pressure the burden also the expectations of my parents.I feel like I am drowning. I want to quit but I can't. I am also having suicidal thoughts lately but I feel like I am too much of a coward to see through it. The pain scares me but living scares me more. Doing the things i don't like living up to people's expectations. Every thing feels tiring and meaning less.
18wkn1h,Anxiety,2024-01-02,Buspirone Help,"Hi all
I‚Äôve been going through it and was just looking for anyone else on here who might have had issues similar and survived. 5 months ago I stopped a sleeping pill/blood pressure pill cold turkey not knowing it would be a problem( totally my fault and definitely not my smartest move) which resulted in me having an insane panic attack. Went to the ER where they gave me an antipsychotic thinking I was having a psychotic break. I wasn‚Äôt and that medicine drove me through the roof and then some. I went and saw my doctor after that and got prescribed  buspirone but so far I haven‚Äôt seen anyone get prescribed it like I was. Doc put me on 30mg immediately and split it up 5 mg every 5 hours meaning I had to wake up middle of the night and take it. For the first month or so I was so nauseous I couldn‚Äôt stand and slept through that month (I truly don‚Äôt even remember it) after that I had my heart slamming in my chest I couldn‚Äôt breath I couldn‚Äôt stop crying I couldn‚Äôt stand for very long without wanting to pass out and was still so nauseous. Finally after 3 months of being told I would be fine and I would even out I called and said I can‚Äôt do this any more because I was starting to get extremely dark thoughts and my body wanted to keel over just sitting up. Doc told me they could no longer help me and told me to go to another doctor which I did. New doctor didn‚Äôt understand why 1st doc not only had me on so much but why I was taking it so much and wanted me to immediately go down to 2 pills a day ( 10mg) for a week and then 1 a week(5mg) and then start a different med. I tried to go down to 2 and 2 days later had an absolute break down. Uncontrollable panic attack. I ended up going back up to 30mg and am now dropping down by 5mg every week or 2 but my skin is on fire and I‚Äôm still having trouble breathing. I finally stopped crying and started being able to control my own thoughts and feelings a bit. Since starting this I‚Äôve still had my heart slamming(feels like almost a heart attack) and persistent anxiety. I‚Äôve never been through something like this in my life and all for a panic attack I had from another pill. No problems before that. Now I‚Äôm struggling to get off a pill I feel like I should have never been put on in the first place. Has anyone,  anyone at all been through anything like this. I know I‚Äôll get through it if I keep on pushing but this feels almost unbearable and I was wondering if anyone else made it out."
18wkm3a,Anxiety,2024-01-02,Overthinking/ health anxiety,"So I recently been having a pain in my neck and legs and short term memory issues and it felt like sinus pressure all over my head.

So I went and looked at the after summary visit n blood work being as I have awful health anxiety and saw that my ck (creatine) was a bit high and I did a dumb thing by looking up what the high levels mean could mean, looked at the worst possible outcome and now I'm scared i have als I really shouldn't be looking up stuff but it's so hard.

18wkj7w,Anxiety,2024-01-02,I have less than 24 hours to get 6 classes to passing grades. What do I do???,"First off, I need to address the fact that this post is absolutely everywhere and was definitely an anxiety dump, I'm looking for advice and opinions on what I should do with my current situation. PLEASE understand that this might be hard to read, and I'd appreciate no negativity on my grammar and/or organization lol thanks guys.

I am literally so stressed out right now, and am definitely procrastinating right now, but I have no motivation to get my classes up and honestly all I want to do is sleep away all my problems. It doesn't really help that I have PTSD nightmares and am struggling to get into a rem sleep stage. I can't get my meds changed until the 5th of January.

I am currently enrolled in online schooling. I joined about 3-4 weeks ago which was right before the deadline that I had access to help from my teachers. Its now been about 10 days and i have been trying so hard to find the motivation and discipline to get myself to wake up and do at least a few assignments.

This might sound like I'm just not that good of a student but up until this year I have been a straight A student but had to go online after being hospitalized for a month 1/2. I've had to have my mom help me with keeping up with my very low maintenance cat. And I haven't been going out with friends or anything like that. I truly am just so exhausted, and I struggle with handling stress.

I've also (somewhat recently) been diagnosed with schizophrenia, which is making my already severe paranoia worse because now I'm questioning every little thing in my life. I'm also going back to my (somewhat higher level) high school next week. 

Now that it is technically the 2nd I have until 11:59 PM to submit as many assignments as I can. I really need advice on what to do. I'm contemplating going to bed right now, waking up in the morning and doing as much as I can for my main courses, and if i still manage to not get my grades to passing, possibly just do online summer school to get the credits back. Should I do that?

18wjmhk,Anxiety,2024-01-02,anxiousness in silent situations,"whenever i am with someone else, or worse, many people, in a silent room, i get really anxious. this stems from a few times that my stomach started growling during school tests which was super embarrassing. but now, even when i am full, i get really nervous that my stomach might start making noises. and because of my extreme anxiety, my stomach is more inclined to make noises. so im sort of stuck in an endless cycle lol. i cannot focus on anything else, and often i‚Äôm silently hyperventilating from anxiety even though i know nothing will happen if i don‚Äôt worry in the first place.

this has been going on since august and has been absolutely horrible for me because i‚Äôm in high school and have tests/ quizzes multiple times a week and of course lectures where the class is silent almost every day. i don‚Äôt know what to do, i‚Äôve tried small exercises to calm my anxiety when it happens but it rarely works because i feel like i‚Äôm overly aware of everything. 

this year of school has also been the most stressful i‚Äôve had and i feel mild anxiety/ stress at home too, but nothing compared to the nervousness in silent situations. can anyone help?"

Im unemployed (have a job for my campus technically but its only 8-10 hrs a week) and in college and im trying to be more proud of myself and see myself as competent and not a stupid kid but im having trouble. 

But there is a problem, my brain has a new excuse it has cooked up a new excuse on why this cant be the case. So since i still rely on my parents financially, i live at home when im not on campus, dont need to pay rent, and they pay half my college fees. I get food, video games and pay 125 dollars a month for car insurence and that is about it.

Im an anxious person who is not sure of themself, if i didnt have my family's help im not sure i would have made it or would be going anywhere. Basically i feel like a kid still and i dont know how to be a ""true"" adult despite turning 21 in a few months. All my mental struggles and trials seem stupid and not important, some of my peers are already employed and supporting themselves, they dont need anyone else and dont owe anyone anything.

I also was told in a class last semseter the biggest predictor of success in college is socioeconomic standing, which definetly gives my fears validation. Overall im conflicted, idk how to feel competent while being a little unsure of myself and relying on my parents, i dont think id even go to college if they didnt help me pay for it, honestly. That fact makes me feel spineless and have no resolve too"

18wh9ww,Anxiety,2024-01-02,Navigating complex family dynamics as the new year begins,"
On New Year's Eve, coincidentally my father's birthday, things were going well until he became intoxicated, using profanity and behaving recklessly. Despite decades of discussions about his drinking problem, it persists. While he has improved over his lifetime. When he drinks alcohol it changes who he is, and being almost 20 weeks pregnant makes me hesitant about bringing a child into a world where my father acts like a child himself. Contemplating distancing myself further and minimizing contact throughout the year, unlike my understanding brother, I struggle to accept his behavior due to past traumas. Recognizing this avoidance pattern, I'm seeking advice on enhancing my well-being in this challenging situation.

Note: Even if I address my father about his poor behavior, he's unlikely to change; he's set in his ways. Observing my brother's understanding and forgiveness, despite enduring childhood trauma caused by our father, highlights a contrast. And making me wonder if I‚Äôm handling things wrong, which in turn is making me question myself as a mother-to-be. While I thought I had moved past those issues, my fathers behavior still triggers and upsets me. It might be more of a personal challenge for me than a problem with him.

On New Year's Day, I approached him to address my discomfort with what happened, intending to take a step back with how often I visit. I felt the need to voice my concerns openly. However, it didn't go as planned. 

The interaction unfolded like this: as I walked down the stairs, he remained silent. Time passed, my husband appeared, and he asked him how he was doing. Later, to start the conversation, I pointed out that he hadn't asked me how I was doing. He responded with profuse apologies without really answering my question, to which I said I didn't need apologies but tried to proceed with discussing his behavior from the previous night. He defensively claimed he did nothing wrong and stormed off before I could finish my thoughts. 

Now my husband is telling me I was too upset/petty and I shouldn‚Äôt have started the conversation by saying ‚Äúyou‚Äôre not going to ask me how I am‚Äù. And if I‚Äôm honest I‚Äôve told him all about all my childhood traumas but he doesn‚Äôt understand it, so it‚Äôs a really lonely feeling right now. 

I feel like I‚Äôm truly alone. And I need to figure this out my self and I have no support. Either they tell me I‚Äôm too upset (even though I‚Äôm speaking calmly/not swearing), too angry, too opinionated. Im constantly hearing excuses for my father‚Äôs bad behaviour. 

At this point I‚Äôm not going back to my parents while he‚Äôs there. Seeking perspectives or thoughts."

I feel a sense of dread, as if something bad will happen. Like someone dying or someone abandoning me. I feel a pit in my stomach &amp; I struggle to breathe. I start to panic &amp; I even feel myself getting irritated because of it. My mind wanders and I have the worst thoughts imaginable. 

My worst fear is taking out this feeling on others. I am really good about not doing that but I have been so worried lately. 

I am usually pretty self aware and can ward off these feelings by using logic &amp; reasoning. Lately these feelings have persisted. I can‚Äôt help but fixate on this feeling when it occurs even though it hurts so bad. Part of me wonders if I am self sabotaging. I only say that because I feel like I should be able to push past this feeling, as that‚Äôs what I‚Äôve always done. 

It is so important to me that I can be the best version of myself for the people around me. Usually I can put my feelings aside and be present but for some reason I am struggling right now."

18wg5n3,Anxiety,2024-01-02,Hydroxyzine success,"I take lexapro for my anxiety. It helps about 80% of the time. Couldn't recommend it more.

I have hydroxyzine prescribed to me for itching/eczema. I didn't have knowledge of its anxiety properties but I take hydroxyzine before bed and taking it for anxiety sounded like it would make me fall asleep drooling, so I never tried it.

I recently returned from a trip in mexico. I bought some hydroxyzine at the Farmacia there. It was in 10mg doses. I am prescribed 25mg in the states and 25mg was enough to make me fall asleep at my keyboard drooling.

But my arm was itching like mad a few hours ago. I ran out of claritin and I put my cream and shit on it. To no avail, it still itched. So I took 10mg hydroxyzine

I had a job interview for a part time gig (I'm in college) which I was fuckin terrified about. Even though I worked as a MANAGER for the same company and was applying for an entry level position(and left on really, really good terms) I shouldn't have been terrified, I was guaranteed the job. 

But, about 30 minutes after, I was like ""oh shit, I have an interview in an hour""

Off I went. Met with HR. I made her laugh her ass off when I told her some stories about what I did at my old location back in my home city.

I got hired for the maximum amount they could give me per hour, waived the requirements to qualify for the better health insurance plan, was given extra leniency on my schedule, and I have extra PTO

If that isn't a W idk what is

TL;DR 10mg hydroxyzine did not make me super drowsy but it made me nail a fuckin job interview without me even feeling anxious."

I‚Äôve always been an anxious person but my anxiety has increased tremendously over the last two years. I started college and it was stressful but in September I had my first panic attack ever mid presentation and it shook me to my core. One of the most damaging experiences of my life hands down. Over the course of my freshmen year I was put in public speaking situations, nothing big just talking about a small thing for a couple minutes, seminar style. These things began eliciting a panic response as well. I managed to get out of all my presentations freshmen year by calling in sick. I simply wouldn‚Äôt have made it through if I tried to do them. I was put on lexapro in December last year to try to help me deal. It didn‚Äôt work, I wasn‚Äôt happy with my decision to take meds and it just made it worse. I started having panic attacks with introductions in the beginning of spring semester and it‚Äôs been downhill from there. In the spring of 2023 I was participating in class often (for some reason raising my hand to speak didn‚Äôt bother me) this changed this fall. By the time winter break came in December I can‚Äôt even raise my hand to talk without feeling panic. I started Prozac a couple weeks ago and I‚Äôm sticking with it this time around. I‚Äôm also trying to find a therapist to talk to. My dilemma now is what to do about returning for my spring semester. I‚Äôm heavily considering taking medical leave and trying to focus on my mental health. The problem is my partner is at my school, and she is one of the only things keeping me sane. I‚Äôm going to be able to see her sometimes but i‚Äôm also so worried to put the on thing going well in my life right now in jeopardy. Im kind of freaking out (partially as a side effect of starting meds) but I could really use some advice. Sorry for the essay."

However, two things recently that have been massive helps and allows to her get to sleep so much easier than anything else she‚Äôs tried m, has been foot rubs with lotion and a small drop of lavender essential oil and, surprisingly enough for her, calming puzzle focused video games (she‚Äôs the furthest thing from a gamer lol)

The games she‚Äôs specifically tried has been the Stanley Parable and Superliminal. They both keep her mind focused while not being overwhelmingly quick or overstimulating with the controls. 

I know these solutions might not work for everyone but using the lotion + lavender combo or playing easy, slow paced puzzle games a few hours before bed have both been game changers for her as of recent and I hope they continue to work for her.

18wf2tl,Anxiety,2024-01-02,Left Ear Rings Occasionally (Long Time Health Anxiety Sufferer),"Long time lurker, first time posting here.  This subreddit and many other forums have been a help to me whenever I've had a bout of health anxiety, which is what led me to go on Zoloft in 2014.  Normally, I'm able to keep my anxiety in check, but I've been dealing with some actual health issues the last couple of years that turned out to be the result of Hashimoto's and Hypothyroidism.  I'm currently being treated for that, as well as high blood pressure and high cholesterol (all of these things run in my family). 

Anyway, due to everything I've been through, I feel my anxiety kicking in about an odd symptom.  Ever since a couple of days before Christmas, I've heard a very low, quick ring sound in my left ear.  It's not constant, and comes and goes randomly but the most common place it happens is in my room when it's quiet and I'm alone with my thoughts focusing on it.  Whenever I'm out and about or distracted with something in my room (reading or playing video games) I don't hear the sound at all.  Even now writing this post, I'm sitting in silence and hearing nothing but my keyboard.

Of course, Google pointed me to tinnitus, but idk if a very quick ringing sound every few hours in a quiet room fits that since to my understanding the noise from that can be loud and constant.  I can also hear about the same as I have been before discovering this (both my TV and computer have remained at 16 for the volume and I rarely use my earbuds but when I do, the volume on my phone is at default).  Nevertheless, the anxiety from this has been worse than the ringing sound.  Growing up, I had many ear infections in my left ear and have always considered it my bad ear even though I haven't had an ear infection since I was 14 (now it only aches on occasion when the weather changes).  I worry about going deaf, and worse, having this very rare tumor that has ringing in one ear as a symptom.

I'm feeling very trapped in my anxiety at the moment.  My family of course thinks I'm fine, but here I am just obsessing over random scenarios.  Along with the short, occasional ring sound, that same ear will pop when I yawn sometimes.  Has anyone had something like this before and has it cleared up or been due to something benign?  Is what I'm hearing even tinnitus in the first place, or is it something my anxiety chose to latch onto and amplify?  I'm in a weird place medical wise as well, as I'm seeing a new primary care doctor for the first time on the 18th.  Is this issue okay for me to wait until then?  I also had bloodwork done last month (old orders from my now former PCP) and all was good, if that helps anyone.

Thanks to everyone who has read this long post! ‚ô•"

18wejoq,Anxiety,2024-01-02,Am I Experiencing Anxiety?,"A quick synopsis about me, I'm a 29 yr old with a healthy life style, and have never really experienced anxiety before, or if I have it hasn't really affected me or at least not to the point where it was noticeable enough to last this long.

Anyways for about a week now, I've been hit with this strange feeling of internal tremors and brain fog, this is the first time I've ever had tremors or felt them like this for so long. The tremors are constant, and I can feel them throughout the entire day. They seem to be at their worst when I wake up or go to bed. The brain fog comes and goes and isn't as prevalent as the tremors. It would be fine if the tremors went away but since it started around seven days ago the tremor feeling is pretty constant. The strength of the tremors have gradually gotten better however, over the past week; with the first few days having really bad vibrations/buzzing sensations. I'd say it's about 60% better than before. After a bit of research to see why it could be happening I seen sometimes anxiety can cause it. I'm not sure why it would randomly happen though as nothing major has impacted me lately and I was on vacation too which seems like the best time to relax.

I'm planning on making an appointment with a doctor soon, just to be sure, but I wanted to throw this out here too to see if it could potentially be anxiety, and how I could make it go away. 

Has anyone experienced anything like this? Or may know if it actually could be anxiety or if it sounds like it's something else.

Thanks :)

18weixz,Anxiety,2024-01-02,Issues at School,"Hello, I am a first year undergraduate. I've had severe anxiety for a few years, but it has gotten much worse and is ruining my life. I am on antidepressants and anti-anxiety meds, but I've only found the antidepressants helpful. 

Recently, I feel like anxiety will kill me. My heart rate is always high, and I have terrible anxiety-related stomach issues. I am fairly healthy, but anxiety is so hard to stop. 

Now, a large issue is school. I will sometimes be so stressed out, I freeze-up. This is terrible as all college exams are timed. Despite understanding all the material and doing loads of practice problems, I've had a few tests I bombed. Because they are pretty much the only factor in grades, mine have been really poor. I also get distracted by my brain constantly. Like if I have a song stuck in my head, I can't focus at all on the problem. 

While they act like they care about mental health, there is nothing in place at my school to help reduce this anxiety. I would greatly benefit from taking tests in a room by myself. But doing so requires reaching out to disability resources, and they have been super unresponsive. 

Any ideas on how I can try preventing this? School is my largest stressor, and for some reason my mind has decided to ensure I never take a break from worrying.

18wdfk9,Anxiety,2024-01-02,Short sudden feeling of full body fatigue?,"I‚Äôve been experiencing stress-related anxiety since around 2020. Symptoms usually include chest pain/tightness, shortness of breath, feeling of imminent doom, higher heart rate, and generally just being on edge. I haven‚Äôt responded well to medication for symptoms so I don‚Äôt take any.

This year, my job got more stressful and a new stress symptom started popping up: sudden short surges of full-body fatigue. I think it‚Äôs triggered in high stress situations where I suddenly (maybe subconsciously) notice the weight of my arms, head, or legs, and they‚Äôre sorta moving down in a falling fashion. So it feels almost like I‚Äôve lost control of my body in a way, which seems to momentarily trick my brain into thinking I‚Äôm actually fatigued and about to pass out. This triggers a sudden anxiety-riddled jolt of a response, and it takes me ~30 seconds of grounding exercises to get back to normal. Usually it happens in work meetings, but it tends to happen when I‚Äôm having to listen or interact with someone for a long stretch of time and I start to dissociate a little.

Has anyone experienced this as an anxiety symptom?

My symptoms overlap a lot with heart disease, and that is unfortunately a source of stress for me. Growing up, I‚Äôve been mostly obese. It‚Äôs not completely ridiculous for me to develop heart disease. So I never truly write these symptoms off as ‚Äújust anxiety‚Äù. There‚Äôs always that bit of doubt in my head that it‚Äôs something worse.

To combat these thoughts, I have been working hard to lose weight and have a healthy diet/exercise system. I‚Äôve lost 30lbs over the past year and have about 40 more pounds to lose this year before I‚Äôm no longer considered obese."

I (24M) have been struggling with physical symptoms of anxiety for a bit now (4-5 months). I am diagnosed on the Autism spectrum and GAD.

There is quite a bit of advice that I have found to ""accept"" the anxiety and the physical symptoms and eventually they will fade. I cant seem to do that, I keep googling (I know that is bad) about other possibilities that it could be as if there has to be an explanation for why I am feeling this way. I also love to look on places like Reddit for people with the same anxiety symptoms as me and get all anxious when its not the exact same thing as me. I know its irrational but I am so sick and tired of these symptoms ruining my life.

I suffer from eye strain (a dull feeling around my eyes, makes my vision feel ""off"") face pressure (feels like sinus pressure around my nose and between my eyes and my cheeks, like I have been smiling for hours) and tension headaches. The headaches are all over my forehead but a lot of tension seems to be at my temples. There is more of a tightness feeling on the top of my head and around to the back of my head. My head also feels really heavy and when I get up from my seat or move around a lot there is this lightheaded feeling I get. These symptoms are constantly present 24/7.

I used to have hand tingling but that comes and goes. I also used to have light sensitivity but that isn't as bad as it used to be.

I have seen my GP, a neurologist, an eye doctor, an ENT, my dentist and an oral surgeon as possible reasons that this is happening and apparently I am in perfect health. I have tried SSRI's, supplements, self care, meditation and exercise. I have had a sinus endoscopy and a CT scan and they came up fine. My GP is convinced this is all anxiety but for some reason I do not trust him.

I am so sick and tired of feeling this way. Any advice for someone like me who cannot seem to accept that this is all just symptoms of stress and anxiety? Thank you!"

Like one moment, I‚Äôd be fine then the next something else pops into head then BOOM, I spiral further  with this foreboding feeling until I end having a panic attack.

18w9l6e,Anxiety,2024-01-01,Follow this brainworm with me?,"So I understand there‚Äôs probably a bunch of posts like the one I‚Äôm about to make but I just kinda need to get these thoughts written out to help me get perspective. 
I‚Äôm wondering what direction my life needs to take? I feel this way occasionally and I‚Äôll tell you why:
When I was a kid, I wanted to be a world-explorer, fiercely independent, and adventurous.  Then comes anxiety/panic disorder/agoraphobia and fear of being alone as a young adult and I haven‚Äôt done any of the things I dreamed of, or it feels that way. 
Suffice to say I have done other things and amazing things I wouldn‚Äôt have dreamed I would get to because of the path I‚Äôve chosen and I worked hard to manage my anxiety and panic (and continue to do so). 
I teach full-time and am working in a career with opportunities to do all sorts of different things. I‚Äôm a volunteer firefighter/medic and I do activities I enjoy.
Despite all that, all I can do is think of myself as a failure because I am 33 and single, live with my parents (because of financial reasons and the profound fear of living alone), Don‚Äôt get out much socially and I dunno what else.
Then I go with family on trips to other places like Boston or LA and begin to think ‚ÄúI could live in a place like this,‚Äù;‚Äùwould I be happier if I uprooted everything I‚Äôve done to start over somewhere else‚Äù ‚Ä¶ and on it goes. There‚Äôs nothing wrong with staying where you came from and working to make it a better place. Why do I have this overwhelming voice in my brain saying I should be doing more, I should be doing this, I should be chuck all the work I‚Äôm doing and love to go somewhere else?

Four plates, four desserts, four seats, you get the idea) My two closest friends were seemingly avoiding me / weirdly excluding me the whole night and I just felt so out of place and unwelcome. 

So already feeling fucking awful we smoked weed, which of course made me fucking spiral. I left them to go home immediately after midnight, and I just sat outside freezing for 40 minutes waiting for my bus. Went home, fell asleep.

I had a panic attack in my dream (frequent occurance for me, I think it‚Äôs a side effect from venlafaxine that I‚Äôm currently on), woke up from that and have been spiraling ever since, feeling like I‚Äôm going fucking INSANE the whole fucking day, literally I walked 30 minutes in the snowstorm up to a frozen lake just standing there FOR AN HOUR IN THE FREEZING COLD CONTEMPLATING DROWNING MYSELF. FOR AN HOUR.

All because I felt like I had lost my mind completely, and my thoughts were racing through my head at fucking 2000kmh.

I eventually tired myself out, went home, slept for 4 hours and woke up just now. I finally now caught a tiny break from the fucking thoughts. 

I just feel paralyzed now. I know as soon as I get up and start doing things I‚Äôm gonna start spiraling again, and I have an exam in 2 fucking days that I am completely unable to study for.

I don‚Äôt need any tips, as I‚Äôve tried everything in the book and it just makes me more insane thinking about anxiety relieving self-assessments.
(My mindset currently is that nothing is real and the world is made up, I am completely insane and all these ""anxiety and depression tips"" and therapy are just a distraction to keep us from realizing how insane we are so we dont kill ourselves.)"

I know it seems minor but ive been googling all sorts about brain tumours and brain cancer now and im just spiralling again, I have severe anxiety when it comes to anything medical whether that be doctors appointments or just going to the pharmacy. anyways I was wondering if anyone had any advice on how to calm these nerves down while I wait for the results?"

I have an a lumbar MRI books in 24 hours. I am scared out of my mind. w/o contrast. I have had chronic back pain for the past 2 years and since chiropractor/physical therapy/meloxicam they are MRIing me for a injection to be ordered. I am very thank full I found doc who is taking me seriously now. But I am so scared for my MRI. My mom died of cancer so the last time I saw an mri machine is was her. So I have a very bad association. I also have very bad health anxiety and very bad sensory issues. My doc told me to take a Xanax before and I will. My husband is driving me.   
Like I am so scared I have a $25 giftcard to the MRI tech since I know will be a challenging patient I HATE tests.   
Anyway. I want to be put in feet first.   
I can‚Äôt wear ear plugs in my ears, they always fall out and I cant move in an mri so I can‚Äôt just fix them, thus that only allows headphones. But I cant stand the head phone that pinch your lower jaw. And I cant move so its not like I can just fix them.  
Also because of my back pain its really hard to put on/take off clothes (let alone be being sedated by Xanax) so to minimize any pain I am going to wear 100% cotton everything that way I don‚Äôt have to change into a gown.   
  
Not to mention the last time I was in a confined space I threw up.   
  
And its not like I got a lot of questions answered when I made the appt. the booker said she cant answer anything. The spine doctor said each dept operates their own way. I called the mri dept and left serval messaged and no one ever got back to me.   
  
Like I really want to cry.

18w7qn8,Anxiety,2024-01-01,Paranoid everyone is trying to kill me,"I'm a teenage girl and I am always paranoid and panicking that I everyone is trying to kill me. I constantly think about it and feel nervous around people. I don't trust when people, even my parents, make my food I have to watch them eat it before me because I think it's poisoned. When a friend brings me a drink or food randomly I will ask them to try it first. When I have food or drinks I always have to keep them with me or keep my eye on them. I always carry my cup with me so that no one puts poison in it even if I am home alone because I'm also terrified someone is in my home waiting for me to go to the bathroom so they can poison my food or drink. I hate living like this and it causes me a lot of problems.

18w7ifm,Anxiety,2024-01-01,Can you always feel an anxiety attack coming on?,"I was diagnosed with GAD as a teen, used to have panic attacks relatively often. I would overthink and then feel like I couldnt breathe and then hyperventilate. I could feel them coming on because I'd stress myself and worry in my head like crazy. 

I hadnt had an anxiety attack for years but a month ago I suddenly had a night where my heart rate escalated to 135, I felt like i couldnt breathe, my chest felt tight,super cold, shaking, etc.  I genuinely thought I was having a heart attack at 26. Followed up at the dr, nothing came up on the ekg so they ruled it an anxiety attack, put me on lexapro and sent me home with xanax for emergencies. 

its happened again last night, except this time my heart felt like it was starting and stopping and I felt like I was suffocating and kept involuntarily jumping. 

These feel so different than how my panic attacks used to feel, I wasnt stressing myself out, my brain was empty, I wasnt even thinking about anything so it makes me wonder if it's something else going on? my cats also go nuts when this happens, pacing, yowling, laying on me the second i sit down 

Could I be stressed and not realize it? I've had some stressful stuff happen lately with losing my job and being a single mom... but I haven't really felt any more anxious than I normally am. especially since taking the lexapro, its like my brain has finally shut off. my anxiety normally presents in racing thoughts and excessive cleaning and I havent been doing any of that lately.."
18w7dzh,Anxiety,2024-01-01,Is it safe to take low dose benzo's 2-4 times per week for anxiety?,"I am a 23 year old male 6' 160 pounds with asthma, anxiety and have dealt with post concussion syndrome in the past.  
I have had diagnosed anxiety disorders (gad, ocd) my whole life but during my adult life it has been very mild and has not affected my day to day life much. However, in the past couple months it has absolutely skyrocketed to arguably the worst it has been with frequent panic attacks and severe difficulty functioning normally at all.  
I have started cognitive behavioural therapy and am gonna do blood tests to see if any deficiencies which might be contributing and am considering starting on a ssri type medication.  
In the meantime though the only thing which has been helping me feel like 'myself' at all and be able to function in social situations is when I take 0.5 of ativan or klonopin. I know these can be very addictive and must be used cautiously but at such a low dose is it safe to take a few times a week like if needed before particularly stressful social situations just to kind of keep my life and social life somewhat on track while hopefully treating the underlying issue? Or is this too much of a slipery slope?  
So far I have taken 7 pills spread out in the span of about a month since I have gotten the perscription and do not feel any symptoms of physical addiction so far."

This is different though.. this is seemingly out of my control.. last night I passed out shortly before midnight and was woken abruptly an hour &amp; a half later by fireworks.. jumped up.. heart racing.. realized it was fire works and settled down.. now I was awake though.. instead of going back to sleep like a good boy.. I decided to stay up and play video games and scroll TikTok.. I didn‚Äôt have work in the morning.. no big deal.. 

Now it‚Äôs 6:30 am.. I‚Äôm exhausted.. but more than willing to sleep.. I lay down and pass out for maybe 15 minutes.. only to wake up to my heart beating really fast and me feeling scared.. it settles down relatively quickly.. I‚Äôm moderately annoyed at this point.. but calm.. I just go eat a Banana and take some sleep gummies.. drink a lot of water.. 

some time passes and eventually I‚Äôm asleep again.. this time though 1 hr / 1hr 15 mins pass and I jump awake again.. heart racing like crazy.. it settles down after 5 - 10 minutes..

18w62gn,Anxiety,2024-01-01,Is what is happening to me normal?,"I am 20M, living in India in a small city. I am doing bachelors from here only. Please forgive me if I won't be able to describe myself properly. So, My family had a business, that's why I always had this in mind that I will do business as well, but then our family's business isn't in a very good shape. When i started bachelors, I thought that i would work on the side and learn a skill or something. I did start learning the skill, but i find myself not putting in a lot of efforts and now, I am in my last year of bachelors, and I still feel like I haven't learned it. I struggle with this thought that what should I do? Stay here in India and do masters, while helping my father in business and maybe establish another business or should i move out of India and do masters abroad and build a life there. It gets so confusing sometimes that I don't even sleep at night and I just keep overthinking about these things. Then there is social media influencing my thoughts every now and then. Sometimes making me feel like money is evil and sometimes making me feel like I want all the wealth in the world. So the skill I am learning is very unconventional therefore I don't find myself comfortable telling anyone about it because then they say that it won't work or why don't you do something safe or conventional. This is exactly the reason why I was thinking of going abroad and pursuing a decent master's degree so that i have a safety net. And, then maybe after some years when that unconventional skill is able to give me enough money, I can quit. I know these are very childish thoughts but they are the way they are. I don't even know whether leaving India would be a good option, since my family parents live here. My brother who is working in Dubai, wants to come back to India and said that he wants a peaceful life with our parents. ( In India we live with our parents forever and leaving them is not a thing here, until and unless someone is working abroad or something, it's like they say that your parents raised you and you have to become their support in their old age ). My family is upper middle class in my city and we know almost half of the city. It's hard to define Indian culture but I am trying. The reason why I think I might not want to leave India is that, the city is known to us, we are known by many here, my family is here, you can get help for everything, like here even house helps have their house helps. For example, here in India, you will see mostly the middle class have drivers, guards, cleaners, handymen, gardeners etc. and their income is only around $2000-3000 a month. But this applies to my small city not the big ones. And if i go abroad, then i won't be close to my parents or family, but maybe I'll get exposure and travel to good places. I don't get this thing, why are we all doing this, for happiness? for comfort? for money? I have so many questions. And i didn't tell you that why i want to move out of india, that is because right now my life is really very boring, and not productive at all, i am literally doing nothing good, and here also there is nothing to do because the city isn't developed. I know this is the shittiest problem you people have listened to, I don't even know what do i need to hear, i don't even know what is the question that i want to ask. But i have to say , i really felt great after writing this. "
18w60fg,Anxiety,2024-01-01,It gets better. Some tips that helped me.,"Years back I remember going through an incredibly difficult time and making a post essentially reaching out here with the subject ""Does it get better?"" or ""Does it get easier"" something along those lines. I got a couple of comments of support which really helped stabilize me back then, and thank you so much for the advice and personal stories, even though I never responded at the time.

Years later though I've answered my own question, and the answer I found is ""Yes""                                 Such a solid, unbelievably beautiful YES.

The past years I've learned to tuck away my anxiety more and more. I view it now as an ""Unhelpful passenger"" along with me, like I'm driving the car and it's always telling me to go faster or slow down. Even if it's sat there in the passenger seat, I've still learned to turn up the radio and block it out.

&amp;#x200B;

Here's a few, albeit probably common, pieces of advice which I've learned which helped me to deal with my anxiety over the years. These might of course not work for anyone, and I'm nowhere near an expert, but I look back at where I was and where I am and I can't help but feel a sense of overcoming this dang thing.

* **Trying to get out, socialize, just leave the house**. That was a big one for me. My father once put it: ""Even if you stand on the doorstep of your house, you're further than you were yesterday"" And I've found that really helps. When a friend reaches out to me now and asks me to hang out, I try and make room in my schedule, even if I don't want to go, just to push myself a lil further.
* **Breathing is a must**. Sounds silly I know, sounds absolutely typical, I know. Your heart is your enemy when it comes to anxiety, little red thing beating bump bump bump. Physically hurts sometimes in my experience, so one of the best things you can do is take a deep breath in those times.
* **Don't beat yourself up over trying.** When I'd put myself out there, I found myself cringing at the memories of how I'd try and fail to socialise, how I wasn't doing a good enough job. What's important is every time you're putting yourself out there, that's a victory against anxiety no matter what the end result of it may be. You're winning one battle at a time.
* **Channel that anxiety somewhere productive**. It's going to sound silly at first, but consider it. If your heart is gonna be racing, if your body is gonna be full of adrenaline, why not forward that energy somewhere productive? Take on some hobby of yours and hit it hard, finish some work even if it's boring as all hell. Over the past few years I took that into online entertainment, literally putting myself at the centre of attention ironically, and it's worked, it's really worked.
* **Don't be afraid to reach out.** Corny as it sounds, everyone has their issues and there'll always be someone who's there to talk to. Nobody is a perfect being and there's nothing to be ashamed of in having anxiety, it's not a switch you flicked ""On"", it's not a choice you made. Nobody should judge you for this, your close friends and family should be there for you during this, and if they aren't, there are lines you can call, people to speak to, or heck, subreddits to ask questions or vent on. You're not alone.

I wanna end this post on an anecdote related to something I went through recently.

Christmas shopping with my mother, we went into a store, it was all very sorta ""Bath/hair/beauty products"" so I was quite out of my element. Immediately a store employee began to talk to me.        He was lovely and spoke with me for a good 10 minutes, talking about everything geeky, we had a lot of shared interests, and I'd forgotten even I was speaking to a stranger. It was so friendly.

A few years ago I'd have panicked, stood in a corner, said ""Hey"" then went onto my phone to text friends, or just stood outside. That person I was when I posted to this sub the first time no longer exists, but I still remember all their pain, that's why I wanted to share my story with anxiety here.       

Anxiety is still a part of me, you can't just get rid of it, but trust me when I tell you that it gets SO much easier to deal with. All you've gotta do is give yourself time, give yourself a chance, and get yourself out there.

Good luck! You've got this."

And with a community here on Reddit i think it‚Äôs amazing  bc we get to vent and talk about our symptoms and try help each other out by giving each other advice and etc . 

Well basically idk if I‚Äôm normal or not bc even doctors can figure it out. And believe me when I say I tried going to every doctor literally heart doctor primary care doctor stomach doctor head doctor it‚Äôs just crazy to me . 

Anyways‚Ä¶
In June I had passed out with my eyes open my ex had to give me cpr I woke up went to the hospital fainted in the er room again within 20 minutes. They told me I had syncope  from low blood pressure . I always had anxiety for over 10 years but never this bad . So ever since than my blood pressure stays at 100/60 108/70 I don‚Äôt know why.  Thing that bothers me is I remember everything I went through the day I passed out and it causes me nervousness stress anxiousness panic because every time I get a anxiety feeling distress feeling I feel like I‚Äôm going to pass out again and I get freaked out . I get burning sensation back of neck arms and when that starts happening I know I‚Äôm going to panic I also became heat intolerant warm / hot weather  makes me feel sick and panic  . Even the heat on in the house 67 degrees makes me panic and feel faint. My body constantly stuck in fight or flight mode sweaty cold hands and feet my ears have whooshing sound I constantly feel distress wake up fatigue no motivation to do nothing can‚Äôt enjoy life I tried zoloft first pill gave me severe anxiety panic nausea faint headache I tried venlafaxine same side effect I tried ecitalopram not sure how to spell it that gave me crazy thoughts just one pill thoughts on how I was gonna die if I would get hit by car or a tornado  I tried Xanax nothing no luck I‚Äôm terrified to go through this again with another medication.

I will be moving to Texas soon and I‚Äôm constantly in distress bc I know it‚Äôs warm there and I got no choice I gotta move there and I want to but I‚Äôm just so afraid I don‚Äôt want to pass out again or keep suffering.

I am currently working a full-time job that very much requires me to put in my full 40 hours a week.

Even though it is a remote job which saves me an immense amount of time from commuting, I still don‚Äôt really have time for anything but work and a bit of recuperation.

I am diagnoses GAD, which leads to a lot of low energy/burn out, and I also have ADHD inattentive presentation‚Äîin summary, I struggle immensely with time management, inattention and low energy.

If anyone has found a job and/or career that has allowed them financial security and a lot of ‚Äúfree time‚Äù despite their anxiety symptoms, then I would be very grateful to hear about it, as that seems to be the thing that I need to simply manage my (so called) life.

18w5ql6,Anxiety,2024-01-01,Rebound anxiety from occasional lorazepam use?,"So I have pretty severe chronic pain in the form of refractory migraine, and lorazepam has been the only thing in a myriad of treatments that has ever decreased my pain in emergency situations. For this reason, my neurologist prescribed me 0.5 mg lorazepam to take occasionally when I have a high pain day (about once a week). However, I‚Äôve had some added stress in the past few months and have been taking the lorazepam a little more often, about twice a week and three times during one particularly difficult week. Since then I‚Äôve noticed an extreme increase in my daily anxiety, with physical panic when I get up every morning, a racing heart, and nausea. Is there any chance that this is caused by the uptick in lorazepam usage frequency? If this is a rebound anxiety effect, how long might it last? Am I still okay to be using the lorazepam occasionally or is this a sign that I should not be using it at all, even for my chronic pain? Thanks!"
18w5q8k,Anxiety,2024-01-01,My anxiety/panic attacke ruined another holiday yet again. Why am I like this and does anyone else feel the same way?,"Hello All. Happy New Year.

I woke up this morning frozen in bed. Very stiff but still can barely move. I managed to pick up my phone and did A LOT of random scrolling. To the point I am not really reading any posts or articles, I'm literally just scrolling at a pace. (I realized I do this a lot before a panic attack explodes, idk why....maybe an attempt to distract myself?) At some point I put down my phone and felt more frozen in place. Limbs were stiff yet heart was beating hard and I felt out of breath. Next thing I know I started crying and hyperventilating. Eventaully, the release allows my muscles to relax and I get up........WHICH TAKES HOURS.

Today for New Year's, I woke up at 10am. I got up at 1pm. I'm so upset with myself. The whole time I felt like I was fighting an internal battle with my mind screaming GET UP DAMMIT. DAMMIT. I CANT. GET UP. AAAAHHHHH.


I'm extremely upset. I have wasted most of the day. I REALLY wanted to enjoy the holiday, find events, dine with family. But I couldn't bring myself to that picture perfect event. So this made me cry more, but for depressive reasons instead.

This isn't the first time this has happened. It's not every holiday, but most of the time. For example, this Christmas was fine, but I did notice I was slightly a bit more anxious than usual. But last year's christmas I did have a panic attack. Thanksgiving and Valentines. Heck, recently I went on my very first vacation/cruise and I ended up stuck in bed with a panic attack.


Things like these make me HATE MYSELF. I AM SO UPSET SO I'M WASTING TIME CRYING EVEN MORE. WHY AM I LIKE THIS? I'M NOT TRYING TO DESTROY HOLIDAYS I SWEAR. I REALLY WANT TO HAVE SOME FUCKING FUN AND JOIN THE FESTIVITY IN THE AIR.

Some things that I am currently pondering on: Am I unconsciously self-destructive? But fucking why? I don't think so, because a big part of me was looking forward to holidays. Or am I doing this for attention? But that makes no sense. I don't tell people I have panic attacks. They just get annoyed that I haven't come out of my room for hours and probably assumed I was sleeping in. I cry silently under the sheets. Okay, maybe not silently and I do whimper and wail but it's not like anyone came in to check on me so far. They have not noticed, and if this is for attention reasons, why would my body still react this way if there was no one enabling my behavior for all these past holidays? So it makes no sense.


I CANNOT FOR THE LIFE OF ME THINK OF A REASONING THAT MAKES SENSE. I HATE IT. I HATE MYSELF. PIECE OF SHIT OF A BODY JUST FUCKING GET UP. YOU'RE DOING THIS TO YOURSELF. YOU'RE THE ONE WHO IS RUINING THE HOLIDAY SEASON. SO WHY, WHY NOT GET UP."
18w58qc,Anxiety,2024-01-01,"Constant anxiety, I take diazepam, is it harmful? Should I switch to something else?","Hello everyone,

  
Unfortunately I have been suffering from constant inner restlessness/anxiety for several years.

Especially in the morning, why I feel there must be something weird with my cortisol levels (?)

  
I have been doing meditation for 9 years, which helped a lot at the beginning. Since the beginning of my medical transition in 2021 (male to female), however, the anxiety has become stronger, especially when I go out, but it is also simply there in the morning. I have been doing physical exercises (yoga, neurogenic tremor) for a year, which alleviate it somewhat. Short-term therapy has made it easier to go out.

  
I have also changed my diet several times (less gluten, less lactose) to see if it improves. I also stopped drinking coffee/energy drinks a year ago. I'm watching my sugar intake very carefully at the moment, as that might also help.

  
I take Ashwaghanda and ice cold showers every day, both of which help a little. Smoking CBD also helps, but it's bad for my voice (due to voice feminization), which is why I want to stop.  
Recently, however, my anxiety has been stronger and I've been taking diazepam. Even a small amount of the 10mg tablet is enough, i.e. I would estimate 1mg per day.

  
However, I'm afraid that my tolerance is now increasing and I'm becoming dependent on it.  
Does anyone have any ideas about what might be a better medication for me? An antidepressant in a low dose? Or should I stick with the low dose of diazepam? I once heard that small amounts of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors work well for some people."

I also didnt relax as much as i wished i did this winter and im a little sad about that. Winter and summer break are anxious times for me usually, i think its due to how much time i habe to myself to think. This winter break was not that bad but i still worried more than i hoped i would.

That way, during the year, I will be able to see what also has an effect.

So I‚Äôve been friends with this girl for the last couple of years and she moved to Cyprus last summer from the UK for 2 years. We‚Äôve always flirted and given eachother compliments at the gym and stuff. She came home for christmas and we saw eachother at the gym and decided to hangout outside of the gym. I always thought she was hot but I was never head over heels. 

Anyway she came round and I had such a good time. We done everything intimate apart from actually doing it. We have said we‚Äôd go for food before she goes back next weekend and we even spoke about me going to Cyprus in the next few months to visit her. 

Since last seeing her I cannot stop thinking about her. She is so perfect and her body is unreal. I genuinely think i‚Äôve caught feels very quick but it feels right. 

But I‚Äôm just so anxious and doubt myself that she won‚Äôt want to see me again and won‚Äôt like me. Even though she‚Äôs been keen since and showed no sign of not being interested.

18w3sma,Anxiety,2024-01-01,My personal (no medication) quick relief for anxiety/depression periods.,"Backstory.  I suffer with really bad anxiety, depression and runination. It gets crippling from the end of December until late Feb like clockwork each year.

I usually bend the knee and take citalopram but the first 4 weeks are always hell on earth. This year I did not prepare for the winter so I ignored the signs and didn‚Äôt start. Lo and behold the day after Christmas I am bed bound, heart racing, sweating, feeling of impending doom keeps adrenaline pumping through my body.

I knew this would not go away without my meds but the issue is the initial side effects from my meds make me more anxious so I am in too deep to start.

What I did instead. I took ashwagandha gummies twice daily. Once first thing in the morning and the other around 4-5pm. I also drink 4-5 cups of green tea (taste like a muddy puddle) every day. When I tell you that the effects of doing this for 3 days was like day and night I mean it! It feels like I have been on my normal meds for months and feel human again. 

I also took melatonin for the first few nights to make sure I didn‚Äôt lose sleep as that just causing more anxiety.

Has anyone else tried this? Because I honestly feel the most relaxed I have in years!?"

18w39r9,Anxiety,2024-01-01,Ways to Use Self-Talk to Improve Mental Health,"How to Use Self-Talk to Improve Mental Health

Mental health is not shaped solely by the tangible forces surrounding us but also by the intangible forces that dwell within. 

The thoughts we cultivate, the conversations we hold with ourselves, and the words that echo within our minds all wield an influence far mightier than we often realise. 

As the sage Lao Tzu wisely said,
‚ÄúMastering others is strength; mastering yourself is true power.‚Äù

Self-talk is the gateway to mastering oneself, the linchpin of inner strength. Studies also suggest that self-talk has a beneficial impact on our mental well-being.

In this article, embark on a journey inward into the depths of your mind and discover how the dialogue you maintain with yourself can contribute to mental health and well-being. 

Beyond the strategies that we‚Äôll delve into, there exists an entire universe of potential within the realm of self-talk, each technique offering the promise of self-empowerment, resilience, and personal transformation.

We will traverse the landscapes of self-compassion, positive affirmations, and gratitude practice. 

We‚Äôll learn how to confront negative thoughts, set realistic goals, and channel our inner dialogue towards problem-solving. 

We‚Äôll explore the delicate balance of embracing self-acceptance and prioritising self-care. 

And we will delve into the importance of seeking support, understanding that vulnerability is not a sign of weakness but a testament to our strength.

This journey is an acknowledgement of the profound interplay between the mind and our mental health. As we venture into the world of self-talk, we‚Äôll discover that the most potent force to shape our mental well-being lies within our minds. 

It is a realm where thoughts transform into action, despair can be replaced with hope, and the battles we fight are often against our doubts and fears.

1.Practice Self-Compassion

Self-compassion is about extending the same kindness, patience, and understanding to yourself that you readily offer to friends and loved ones. 

When practising self-compassion through self-talk, think of it as an inner dialogue of comfort and support. Instead of being overly critical or judgmental when you make a mistake or face difficulties, your self-talk should sound like a reassuring friend. 

For example, if you fall short of your expectations, tell yourself, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs okay; everyone makes mistakes. I can learn and grow from this experience.‚Äù 

By adopting this approach, you not only ease your emotional burden but also build resilience in the face of life‚Äôs challenges.

2.Challenge Negative Thoughts

Negative thoughts can be pervasive and damaging to your mental well-being. 

To combat them effectively, use self-talk as a tool to critically examine these thoughts. 

Ask yourself whether they are rooted in reality or based on unverified assumptions. Challenge the validity of these thoughts and replace them with more balanced, constructive affirmations. 

For instance, if you catch yourself thinking, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a failure,‚Äù question that thought with, ‚ÄúIs this thought accurate, oram I generalizing from one experience? I may have failed at this task, but that doesn‚Äôt define my overall worth. 

I can learn from this experience and do better next time.‚Äù This practice helps in maintaining a healthier and more positive self-image.

3.Cultivate Positive Affirmations

Positive affirmations are powerful, personalised statements affirming your positive qualities, beliefs, and capabilities.

They can address specific needs such as self-esteem, confidence, or emotional well-being. 

Using self-talk, you can incorporate these affirmations into your daily life. Repeatedly stating these affirmations helps rewire your brain to think more optimistically. 

For example, if you struggle with self-esteem, integrate self-talk like, ‚ÄúI am confident and capable. I believe in myself and my abilities.‚Äù By doing this, you gradually build a more positive self-perception.

4.Set Realistic Goals

Self-talk can play a pivotal role in setting and achieving realistic goals. Instead of striving for perfection, use self-talk to remind yourself that progress is a continuous journey. 

Encourage yourself by saying, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm setting achievable goals and taking one step at a time to reach them.‚Äù This self-talk emphasizes the importance of acknowledging your progress and celebrating small victories along the way. 

It‚Äôs not just about the destination but the journey and the personal growth accompanying it.

5.Manage Stress and Anxiety

Stress and anxiety can take a toll on your mental health. 

Research suggests that self-talk can be a powerful tool to regain control during stressful moments. Employ phrases like ‚ÄúI can handle this‚Äù or ‚ÄúThis too shall pass‚Äù to center your thoughts and emotions. 

These affirmations remind you that you have the inner strength to cope with challenges and that difficult moments are transient. By using these positive self-talk techniques, you can maintain composure and focus even when faced with adversity.

6.Express Gratitude

The practice of gratitude through self-talk involves taking deliberate moments each day to acknowledge and appreciate the positive aspects of your life. 

This self-talk shift redirects your focus from dwelling on negativity to embracing the blessings you possess. 

By regularly recognizing and appreciating the good, you can cultivate a more content and optimistic mindset. 

For instance, you might say to yourself, ‚ÄúI am grateful for the love and support of my friends and family. I appreciate the opportunities that life has given me.‚Äù Expressing gratitude in this manner can significantly improve your overall sense of well-being."

But, my health anxiety has gotten WAY worse recently, and I was looking at a white wall yet again at my sisters house yesterday when we were painting, so I was really focusing and I noticed it again. I had an eye examination with my regular optometrist on the 30th of December, so a little over a week ago, and her words quote were ""Alright, your eyes are young and healthy as they should be. I'll see ya next year!"" I tried not to freak myself out, but after Googling and seeing all kinds of crazy stuff, I'm kind of spirling. I've always had visual snow, floaters, black spots, etc. Like literally since I was 6 or 7, and I'm 28 now. I wear contacts/galsses due to an astigmatism, so yearly exams are non-negotiable for  me. Even with all the crazy things my eyes have always done, I've always been given a clean bill of eye health from multiple optometrists. I read that high blood pressure and diabetes could cause eye issues, so even though I'm anxious as heck, I checked my bp, which was 139/88 with a hr of 97, then it went down to 131/83 with a hr of 76 after sitting breathing about five minutes, once again, I was VERY anxious. My blood sugar, which anxiety can't affect to my knowledge, was 100, and I had eaten about 2 hours prior to that. I know that with anxiety, you're HYPER aware all the time and notice every little thing. Has anyone else ever done this?"

18wjp5o,Anxiety,2024-01-02,I don‚Äôt know if I should take this job or not due to my social anxiety,"Hey so I (25F) interviewed for a sales associate job at this clothing store a couple of weeks ago. I got a call on Friday asking if I‚Äôm still interested in the position - I think they want to offer it to me. I‚Äôm apprehensive about taking the job though since I have bad social anxiety.  I‚Äôm now worried what if I take the job and get overwhelmed or have a panic attack? The clothing store is located in a mall and it could get busy on the weekends. 

My anxiety is pretty bad and I feel like I get overwhelmed easily. I especially have bad social anxiety, usually when I socialize, my heart starts racing and I feel like I‚Äôm freaking out inside. I do really need a job though, I pretty much applied for the job out of desperation. I currently live with my parents who are extremely verbally abusive and having a job would help me earn enough money for an apartment. Plus it‚Äôs at one of my favorite stores. But I‚Äôm also wondering if maybe I should turn down the offer and look for different, non people facing jobs, like as a dishwasher?

I‚Äôm also dealing with some health issues at the moment like insomnia, high blood pressure, gastritis and high cholesterol. A part of me is wondering if maybe I should work on those first and then look for a job but I don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs a smart decision given my home environment and the fact that the longer I put off looking for a job, the longer I will be living at home.

I have a therapist that I could talk to about this but I don‚Äôt see her until this upcoming Friday. She‚Äôs also pretty crappy and I‚Äôm currently trying to find a new therapist. I might try calling her just to see if there‚Äôs anyway she can talk to me about this before Friday but I doubt she‚Äôll be able to see me before than."

We‚Äôll hang out and talk for hours, they‚Äôll invite me out, and they‚Äôre excited to see me. And yet, without fail, almost every time after we have a good moment, my brain tells me they secretly hate me. 

It‚Äôs a horrible feeling that makes me feel so sick to my stomach. It‚Äôs overwhelming and it hurts so bad in my chest. I know this is a form of anxiety and self hatred, but I don‚Äôt know how to think about when this started, or why. The feelings get so intense I either need to seek reassurance or, I dunno, cry. I always give in to seeking reassurance and trying to make the feeling go away.

18w2mc5,Anxiety,2024-01-01,Anxiety about making a life change.. how do I cope with this?,"My freshman year of college I was doing so much and I had barely time to think or process. In the 2nd semester I experienced much more anxiety, specifically social and health anxiety and I had general drama with friends that was sooo stressful. 

Then the summer came and I was burnt out, and this carried into my sophomore year which is where I am right now. This fall semester it all hit me that I‚Äôm spending 4 years at college, away from home, on my own..and that made me panic. 

After experiencing debilitating anxiety I started medication in November and it‚Äôs helped in some ways, but it won‚Äôt solve my situation of being away from home. I also feel like I need to work on my mental health which feels much harder when I‚Äôm away from home.

18w1dxw,Anxiety,2024-01-01,Help... im very anxious about rabies,"Sorry, i tend to be hypochondriac at times.

Just last week Wednesday, i petted stray cats at a park.The park is famous for having a community of friendly cats. All i did was just massage their fur at their head and back. All was fine until i caught myself involuntarily picking my nose shortly afterwards.

I realized, ""oh shit, this was the same hand i used to pet the cat""

And now I'm scared i might have risked myself from getting rabies since nose contains mucosal membrane

I wasn't bitten or scratched or licked on an open wound or a mucosal lining. Plus the cats i petted are not acting unusual or aggressive. None of the cats i petted are drooling or acting rabid. My cousin was also there petting them too.

But my anxiety is still affecting me. I keep asks myself this, like what if rabies virus are found on fur after the cat groomed itself?

Im planning to make an appointment with a gp doctor tomorrow so he can weigh in his professional opinion and decide the step forward, but my dad said that it would be a waste of money cause the risk is low.

I really don't know."

18w157c,Anxiety,2024-01-01,I'm so lost,"Sorry this is going to be a long post but I have been going through it for the past 6 months or so and am at a loss at this point. Back in July I was learning to weld at my job and was a bit moody and irritable nothing to severe at all but didn't like it so I decided to take some lexapro I had left over from last year.  Not long after I experienced what I thought was a panic attack, i got tingly all over and dizzy and felt like I was going to pass out. I then went to my primary care doctor and he put me on effexor which only made my anxiety worse and then within a week I was on prozac which after a little over a week landed me in the hospital. I was to the point where I was constantly feeling dizzy and couldn't be around anyone, I was breaking down crying uncontrollably and I had never felt so hopeless in my life. After getting out of the hospital I had told the new psych Dr I met that I wanted to try no meds because I was fine before all the meds and he diagnosed me bp2 and said that's why i was having such a bad reaction to the ssris. He then put me on lamictal and I was only on that 6 weeks it made me feel like a zombie and more fatigued I got up to 100 mg and before I came off had cut down to 50 mg for 2 days and he said I could just stop. I went 8 weeks without any meds and the impending doom started to lift after a few weeks, but I started getting very intrusive thoughts i had never experienced before, I was scared I was going to snap and lose it, then I was to the point that when I would get around anyone I would get tingly and feel like I was going to pass out.  I saw a trauma therapist who said this sounds like panic disorder to her and suggested I see a doctor through their company and ask for something strong acting to help with the panic attacks. I met with another doctor and this doctor told me she doesn't believe I am bipolar at all just sounds like some severe anxiety and panic with some mild depression which is expected. She then put me on prozac and told me I would get something fast acting for the anxiety,  I tried clonidine, buspar, hydroxyzine and none have helped. I have been a little over 2 weeks on the zoloft and I am not feeling any better,  I did see a new primary care doctor who gave me .25 xanax to help with the anxiety but I am very skeptical because I am in recovery and don't want to get hooked on these. I don't understand what has happened to me,  I can hardly leave my house at all for months now,  I can't stop feeling like I'm going crazy and i have never in my life been like this before. Last week after meeting with my therapist she couldn't help but wonder if this is somehow physical because I am constantly dizzy, randomly feel tingly, feel off balance all the time. So  I got a new  primary doctor and askedif we could please see if there is something physically causing all of this and I have my blood results from my old doctor back in August which showed my vitamin d is 23.6, my ferritin is 15, my b12 is 46. I'm not understanding how I was literally fine before all these meds and now I can't seem to get back to me, i am so tired and I know this isn't who I am but I don't know what to do. I miss going out with friends, I miss enjoying spending time with my partner, I am very self aware and have worked through a lot of trauma and stuff from my past but I have never in my life been like this before. Can anyone relate???"
18w1058,Anxiety,2024-01-01,"As someone with anxiety, I don't understand how I'm supposed to function in this world.","I'm constantly in one massive panic attack, to the point where I don't really remember what being calm feels like. 

Absolutely everything triggers my anxiety, but especially things having to do with the law, so driving is out of the question because I'm afraid of getting pulled over, working is off the table because messing up my taxes is illegal.

It just feels like all I'm good for is sitting around and doing a chore or two, and playing my video games. Everything that is ""normal"" for someone my age (18M) to do, like working, getting a credit card, shit like that, sends nothing but panic and fear to my brain. I've gotten to the point to where I'm not even interested in living a normal life anymore, I've panicked about everything for so long that it's broken me."
18w0o62,Anxiety,2024-01-01,Are these symptoms similar to yours? (Share your experience please),"To preface for the rules: I'm not asking for a diagnosis, nor reassurance. I'm merely trying to get an idea of what anxiety really is like at this level that doctors are saying I have, and if others have experience similar to mine.

Possible triggers: Anxiety symptoms, doctors being dismissive

I'm gonna try to keep this relatively short: I've never been an anxious person. I've been stressed, and I can have outbursts, but even my outbursts are usually maintained and never directed at anyone, but more of a venting strategy in which I get angry at the situation, and never the people.

But I've had what I considered panic attacks in the past that I went to the hospital for, because I thought they were heart attacks. The symptoms were: A 'dropping' feeling in my chest, high heart rate (140-160+), chest pressure, and waves going through my entire body. They deemed my heart was fine.

But on the 22nd, I went to the hospital because I had a non-stop fight or flight feeling in my chest for about 4 days straight at that point. They gave me some medicine. I took the medicine when I got it on the 24th, and had a bad reaction to it (hydroxyzine). I went back to the hospital and they did their treatments. Then they kept me for 3 days, where I had multiple panic attacks (similar to above symptoms. I'm explaining this because the symptoms change later) and constant anxiety feeling in my chest. They did a stress test with x rays. They found a few minor problems with my heart and changes in my ECGs, but they said it's nothing urgently serious, so I'm following up with my cardiologist in a few days. Spent 3 days in the hospital.

So that means I spent 24th-26th in the hospital. The feeling in my chest was so bad, I couldn't get up from laying down for days. Then I started feeling better, so I started getting up a bit more, playing games, and resuming my activities with some breaks to laying back down when it got bad again.

Then today, I'm feeling a bit in my chest again. I go to lay down on my back yet again. I'm doing my deep breathing to keep my heart rate and anxiety low. However, my arms and legs start tingling really bad. It kind of goes away, comes back, goes away, etc. Then my throat and neck start tingling as well. This is new to me. It's always been my limbs tingling.

Then all hell breaks loose from nowhere. To be clear: I am not anxious about anything. I'm not panicking, I'm not worried. In my mind, I'm pretty relaxed. But then my chest SINKS. IMMENSE pressure. All of my limbs immediately feel like they're being tased. They go numb, but I can still feel the tingling as well as an INTENSE vibration, like I'm holding onto one of those carnival machines that massage your hands or whatever they're supposed to do. I start having trouble breathing, my thighs lock up COMPLETELY to the point that I couldn't walk if I wanted to. I start seeing spots in my eyes like I was losing small dots of vision. My heart rate soars.

I went back to the hospital. They did an ECG and a blood test (That's all they did) and said I was fine, and it's anxiety. As I tried explaining things, the doctor just said ""yea that's anxiety"" which felt dismissive, along with other doctors having done the same.

If this is anxiety, it immediately just went to severe levels for no knowable reason in the last week, and keeps happening with worse symptoms each time. They hospital had prescribed me .25 mg of xanax until I see my primary care physician on the 10th, and cardiologist on the 4th, but I'm worried about taking it because of my extreme reaction to 50mg of hydroxyzine (which yea is likely silly, but I'm starting to feel like my body can't take much more).

Has anyone had symptoms similar to mine? Or went from never being anxious to all hell breaking loose and not stopping being anxious? I'd really like to hear some of your stories. Because of what I've read so far, this seems like some of the most extreme symptoms of anxiety, and there was no ramp-up to it. I just have these symptoms now whereas the day before, for my entire life, I was perfectly fine outside of an extremely few panic attack incidents. I mean, I literally couldn't walk and my thighs locked up for hours.

And to say it again: I'm not asking for a diagnosis, medical help, or reassurance that I'll be okay. I'm doing everything I can do to find out what's happening to me and get it taken care of. I'm just asking if other people have had similar experiences."
18w0jm2,Anxiety,2024-01-01,Do you tell people you have anxiety when they notice your behaviour?,I was diagnosed with anxiety last year but I still don't know when and if I should tell people. I particularly suffer from social anxiety. I feel like I would tell close friends but to be honest no one feels close enough to tell at the moment. Sometimes as part of my social anxiety I lose my appetite when I'm with a group of people and there's an expectation to talk during the meal or whatever. For example I went on a college trip this year and there was no one going on it that I knew beforehand. When it was time for dinner I just stayed in my room because I knew I wouldn't be able to eat and I didn't want to explain it. Someone who I had been talking to noticed and I put it off as feeling a little unwell. I just suppose I'm just wondering how do people react when you tell them and how soon you would do it.

18vzj67,Anxiety,2024-01-01,Medicating for anxiety that isn‚Äôt acute but is still impacting your life?,"I rarely get acute anxiety symptoms but I‚Äôve realise that my avoidant behaviour is insidiously ruining my life and it‚Äôs rooted in anxiety, specifically fear of commitment, fear of failure and fear of rejection. Such situations can elicit some physical anxiety symptoms but they‚Äôre usually not too intense.

So perhaps it‚Äôs more to do with self esteem and self talk 

 I‚Äôve been recommended anxiolytic medication as an antidote to these issues (by a non expert ) but I don‚Äôt see how they will address the core issues and change my outlook. 

Also I‚Äôm hesitant to take any medication like that because I‚Äôm worried they‚Äôll either slow me down too much or I‚Äôll become addicted to them or reliant on them.

18vzhvg,Anxiety,2024-01-01,"Symptoms For 3 Months, Do I just Give In?","I need serious help ins someone rationalizing my thoughts and fears. This is a long read since it me venting as much as it is a genuine post so I'm sorry. I'm 28. Male. For the past 3 months, I have had some very varying levels of symptoms and if you want to see me going insane you can check my post history, along with ones that have my labs I've taken so far.

2 ER visits when the symptoms first started, and 3-4 clinic visits later and a bunch of labs that still my the GNP at my PCP's clinics and virtually have had kind of been spoonfed talks about my physical health activity-wise, and get spoken to like my months long symptoms are extreme anxiety/stress/grief induced...

EKGs, chest X-rays, blood panels, lipid panels, random UR(ine) test, hepatic panels, eGFR healthy readings... But yet

I have had: 
- Tension headaches that are more pressure than actual pain (top, sides, forehead, back of head)
- Fast heartbeat (First month)
- Cramp like pains, limb pains, joint paints (Throughout)
- Insomnia/terrible sleeping patterns due to 3-5 hours at a time
- Upper left chest pains/sometimes right
- Rib pains, sensitivity, 
- Neck/back between shoulder blades pain 
- Constipation/Nausea/Diarrhea (Varying)
- Stomach/Abdominal pains/activity
- Slight memory/mild confusion problems where my thoughts process sometimes just murks up slightly, or I cant pinpoint where my internal thoughts are going. Reading sometimes feel like I gloss too quickly over words now and misread.
- Recently the last weeks, STABBING pains that seem to be JUST under my rib line. Mostly right sided. Almost as if it's my diaphragm.
- My increased awareness of my body has resulted in me observing myself more, finding moles that weren't there years before. Or thinking there were changes in others in size or color consistency. This makes me worry about cancer.
- I AM low in Vitamin D at 10ng/ml, from one of the resulting tests
- Yellow-brown pale stools after constipation

I've been suggested/prescribed:
- 50,000K IU Vit D weekly, since a week ago (only 1 months worth)
- Was taking 5K IU daily Vit D until above prescription ^
- Magnesium Oxide (Switched to Glycinate due to diarrhea) since 2.5 months
- Culturelle Probiotics, 5Bil Count since 2.5 months


I feel like sometimes I notice a difference but then sometimes not.



I know I have health anxiety, but, this is only because of my symptoms showing up kind of suddenly back in October. These past 3 months have been hell and extremely crippling, and every attempt at a ER or clinical visit, I have been deduced it was anxiety yet I've experienced all these symptoms for some time now.

Some have changed, some of them lessen in severity, some of them have gone, some of them have come back after a month or weeks. In the end of November/mid December it seemed like I was starting to feel better but then it just went back to it.

I am mentally dismantling myself due to their persistence yet advocating for myself is so difficult. I'm so close to throwing in the towel and just... Letting it be what I suffer with and say it's just anxiety.

Googling symptoms to rationalize fucking sucks. It's led me to thinking blood clots or embolisms back in the beginning, to liver/kidney problems, and now I worry about straight up cancer especially if it has resulted in me paying attention to my body after years of barely even thinking to establish a medical professional safety net.

 But yet it feels like the symptoms sticking around for so long deserves my attention when it's been THREE months, but yet the Internet is so double sided because I see people say it can be extreme anxiety or stress- OR -a serious condition or outright cancer.

It's a vicious circle and I've never had a period of time as long as this one where I had a mystery ailment. Maybe a week or two or so maybe one time every one year or so for the past 5ish years but yet never like this and it begs the question if this is progression of something serious rather than ""just anxiety"". But all the big bad things that I COULD have lie under the murky waters of my PCP clinic taking their time and believing it is anxiety/stress. I haven't talked about my newfound mole, or changes in existing ones yet, but that was because I have an appointment tomorrow amongst a handful Ive already had between actually noticing them.

I need help, and at least in part of anyone can tell me opinions or any sort of similarities between anyone and I. I'm at the end of my rope, honestly, because trying to go to professionals only gets me. 

Do I advocate for myself harder?
Do I give into the ""you have high anxiety""?
I lost my mother 2 year ago and now since it's on record they won't stop bringing it up, either when it comes to stress and anxiety.

 But my symptoms persist to a degree that I just... Can't ignore when the waiting isn't doing anything to remedy my issues."

18vz9ko,Anxiety,2024-01-01,Switching from xanax to klonopin,"I was previously on 1.5- 2 mg a day of Xanax for anxiety. My dosage was 1mg XR in the morning and 0.5 mg XR at night. I also have the regular 0.25 mg I can take 3 a day. I never take 3, usually just one or 2 of those if I have to go in a store or something. Terrible agoraphobia. 
Anyway my new doctor asked if I‚Äôd like to switch to klonopin because the Xanax aren‚Äôt helping anymore as I‚Äôve gained a tolerance and I just don‚Äôt want to up my dose. 
He prescribed me 0.5 of the klonopin up the 3 times a day. So yesterday I was reading that they are equal to Xanax and it scared me that if I didn‚Äôt take all three pills I might have withdrawal. So I felt okay and no panic after the first pill. About 8 hours later I started to worry about withdrawal and took the second. It knocked me on my butt and made me feel high.. 

I guess I‚Äôm asking any advice from others who have switched did you keep them same dose? 
He also still prescribes me the regular Xanax 0.25 but I really don‚Äôt want to take those. I‚Äôd rather just be done with Xanax all together. 

Edited to add I have been on different doses of Xanax for over 10 years. This being the lower end and I‚Äôve been at 1.5-2 mg a day for at least two years. Also I‚Äôm aware of the addiction, memory loss, and all of that."
18vyyx3,Anxiety,2024-01-01,Propranolol possible causing diarrhoea?,"Hi all,

I‚Äôve just started taking propranolol for panic attacks (on day two) and I‚Äôve noticed I‚Äôve been having some (minor) diarrhoea. I know this could be caused by the medication, but does it ease off?
Apart from that, I‚Äôve not noticed any other side effects thankfully. I‚Äôm also not 100% the meds are causing it, I do get anxious tummy issues, but in case it is, it would be great to hear other people‚Äôs experience.

Tomorrow is my first day back at work and I will be taking it before I go as I get severe anxiety anywhere outside of my house (I suffer from agoraphobia). 

Oh and I‚Äôm only taking 10mg as and when needed. 

Thanks in advance for any input or advice."

18vy3k6,Anxiety,2024-01-01,I‚Äôm so tired of my health anxiety and I‚Äôm so worn out,"2023 year has been the hardest year for my health anxiety and I‚Äôm so sick of it. I knew 3 people die of cancer this year so I have been fucking terrified of cancer and every little thing I feel is off, my IMMEDIATE thought is ‚Äúcancer‚Äù.

I‚Äôm 31 years old male. This year I‚Äôve had like 5 blood tests done for hepatic function, metabolic, urinalysis, colonoscopy and endoscopy, like 4 ultrasounds. All have been fine. 

I thought I had lymphoma and it turned out to be a benign lymph node. Thought i had a clot and it turned out to be a non vascular cyst. Colonoscopy and endoscopy was all fine minus a minor hemorrhoid. All my blood tests came back fine.

Thought I had prostate or bladder issues. Went to my urologist and was told I‚Äôm fine and said I had the best urine he‚Äôs seen all day and he LITERALLY told me to stop worrying and go drink a glass of wine üòëüòë. I told him my primary care ordered a prostate blood test and was like ‚Äúwhat the fuck?? Why would she order that?? That‚Äôs so stupid. At your age??‚Äù

I went to my primary care so much that I‚Äôd be like ‚Äúhi Doctor *name*!! I‚Äôm back again! üòÖ‚Äù and she told me that she ordered it to give me some peace of mind. 

Thought I might have lung cancer and did a chest x ray and everything was fine. 

Now I‚Äôm feeling something in my stomach again and I‚Äôm like ‚Äúoh no it‚Äôs liver cancer or something.

I‚Äôm just so so fucking tired. Feel like this year has been wasted because this anxiety has kept me in a state of depression and frozen in time.

I can‚Äôt even enjoy the food that I used to enjoy because healthy eating. I feel guilty when I sip half a glass or juice because ‚Äúsugar‚Äù and diabetes becuase HbA1C was highest it‚Äôs been this past year at 5.3. Still below even prediabetes level but I got spooked.

I‚Äôm just unhappy.

I want to stop worrying but my fear is that as SOON as I stop worrying then something bad will happen under my radar. "

190agpv,Anxiety,2024-01-06,Here to help,"Currently in bed after university, wrecked! 

This year I begun studying holistic counselling &amp; psychotherapy, it‚Äôs been a dream. 

You see, for the last 5 years I have been dealing with generalised anxiety disorder, panic disorder and undiagnosed depression. 

I suffered beyond comprehension, words will never do justice. 

I used to scroll through this forum, looking for the answers every minute of my waking hell that was life. 

I searched high &amp; low for the answers, and all I was left with was further hopelessness, and ultimately the only thing that seemed in my control was when I chose to leave this world. 

One day arose where something changed. I had an urge to fight back. I said to myself I‚Äôm already in hell, let‚Äôs see how much I live despite this all, and whilst doing this let‚Äôs see if I can get my life back to some degree. 

I stopped looking externally, and dove into the last place I thought: Myself. 

It all changed when I looked within, everything changed. 

Fast forward to today, 0 panic attacks, anxiety is up and down, but I am here &amp; I have a purpose. Losing mum two years ago wasn‚Äôt easy but I added it to the fire that fuels me everyday. 

You see you can either be a victim or a victor. 

This is life, it‚Äôs beautiful, it‚Äôs horrifying, but it‚Äôs all perception. I had a sad beginning, but that is not the end. In fact I‚Äôm not even a quarter of the way through the book!! 

So if I was to say anything to you tonight it would be, impossible is nothing.

I am with them over the holidays, and she triggers me so much, I just think she looks horrible, worn out, tired and ugly, in a way that gives me anxiety. I have very negative feelings towards her. I am also depressed and unwell myself, so that makes it stronger, and she is also worried about me. But I cannot stop thinking terrible things about her and feel bad about that. She was often sick and unwell mentally when I was a child and emotionally abusive, shouted a lot, exploded, was aggressive and abusive towards my father, so I guess that plays into how I see her. And of course that triggered me having mental issues as an adult, and she knows that, and we just developed this horrible dynamic, to be honest I cannot stand her, although she tries and wants me to be better. Just her whole presence is so heavy, the way she speaks, how she coughs, just very unpleasant. And then that makes me behave like an a-hole, and probably I should just not spend time with her, I don't know.

18vx2af,Anxiety,2024-01-01,Am I Enough?,"The Radiant Star

Once upon a time, in a land filled with doubts and insecurities, there lived a radiant star named Luna. But Luna often questioned herself, wondering, ""Am I enough?""

One day, as Luna gazed upon the world, she realized her true brilliance. She shimmered like the sun, casting her warm light upon the earth. In that moment, she knew the answer: ""Yes, I am enough!""

Luna understood that she didn't have to please everyone. Like the sun, she couldn't brighten every corner at once. But her light was powerful, capable of touching hearts and illuminating paths. Embracing this truth, she released the burden of trying to please everyone.

Sometimes, Luna's mind played tricks on her, filling her thoughts with self-doubt. But she discovered that these thoughts were not her reality. With a courageous spirit, she learned to let them go, setting herself free from their grasp.

Luna realized that comparing herself to others only dimmed her light. She was unique, special, and rare. Each person she encountered had their own journey, their own dreams. So instead of comparing, Luna celebrated her individuality and embraced the differences that made her shine.

In the company of others, Luna remained true to herself. She understood that no one could truly know the depths of her thoughts and emotions. So she chose to be authentic, allowing her genuine self to radiate like a guiding star. And in doing so, she discovered happiness and freedom, living her life with zeal.

Luna recognized that her thoughts were within her control. She could release the ones that caused distress and hold onto those that brought peace. With the power of her mind, she became the master of her own thoughts, bidding farewell to anxiety.

With every realization, Luna's confidence grew. She knew, without a doubt, that she was more than enough. She not only survived, but thrived and soared to unimaginable heights. Her light became a beacon of hope for others, inspiring them to believe in their own worth.

""Yes,"" Luna declared, her voice resonating across the universe. ""I am enough and more!"" Her spirit ignited with passion, fueling her determination. She embraced her true self, a radiant star bursting with sunshine, joy, and peace. And as she released her worries, her heart danced with a melody of contentment.

So, my friend, remember Luna's tale. You too are enough, worthy, strong, and tough. No challenge is insurmountable, no dream too far. Believe in yourself, let your light shine, and make your heart sing. For within you lies a brilliance that can illuminate the world."

18vw7c0,Anxiety,2024-01-01,Benefits of Laughter,"Laughter has various health benefits. Physiologically, it triggers the release of endorphins, the body's natural feel-good chemicals, promoting an overall sense of well-being. It also reduces stress hormones, such as cortisol, which can contribute to anxiety and other negative health effects.

Psychologically, laughter can improve mood, increase resilience to stress, and enhance social bonds. It fosters a positive mindset, helping to shift perspectives and cope with challenges. Additionally, laughing often involves deep breaths, promoting better respiratory function and increasing oxygen flow.

Socially, laughter is a universal language that strengthens connections between individuals. Shared laughter fosters a sense of camaraderie and can improve communication. Moreover, the act of laughing together promotes a positive and enjoyable atmosphere, contributing to overall mental and emotional health.

In summary, laughter is a multifaceted activity that positively impacts physical, psychological, and social aspects of health, making it a valuable and enjoyable component of a healthy lifestyle."

18vv2ul,Anxiety,2024-01-01,Some advice about hypochondria?,"I made an account only to write this. There's a chance that I'm making this worse by making this post but health anxiety stops me from enjoying anything and I need to put it out somehwere.

I am a very anxious person overall, if something exists than it probably stresses me out. But being stressed out about my health is absolutely the worst. 

I've had a few episodes with hypochondria in my life. I am turning 23 this year. When I was very young I would often watch some programs about diseases and then I wouldn't be able to sleep at night because of them. 

It got calmer until about two years ago I noticed a weird mole on my skin and I was terrified that it could be melanoma. I went to doctor and he told me that it's nothing serios and it's just a mark, but for some reason I couldn't believe him and I contacted another doctor. He confirmed what the previous one said. He also sort of ridicouled me for thinking  that it was melanoma, but in a comforting way and that really helped me. 

It was calm for two years until in September I drank a little bit too much caffeine for one day and my heart was racing. I googled it and of course I found something about it potentially being a heart attack. Since then I have been living in fear. 

Cardiologist told me that I can't really have heart attack but I'm worried about something else right now. About a month and a half ago I noticed a that I have noticed headache. Not sharp or severe one, it wasn't bothering me initially, and It doesn't hurt all the time (mostly when I think about it) but few days ago I thought to myself ""what if it's some sort of cancer?"" I went to doctor to check this, and I think I didn't describe it well enough, however she ordered me to do blood tests. I did and everything was in norm except for one test and I am now freaked out because of it. Couldn't deliver the results of the tests yet because the clinic is closed until tomorrow.

I know that many people struggle with hypochondria but the thought of being this one unlucky person who really has a disease stresses me out so much. I know everybody goes one day but I don't want to do it yet. I am constantly searching for comfort and I talk to everyone about this and I think that they are getting annoyed with it. This pain could even be caused by me hitting myself on the head and not remembering about it (because that's how it feels btw.) but I can't help thinking how is it to be dead and how my family would react to me being sick. 

In hindsight I am thinking that maybe I shouldn't have went to doctor this time around and sooner or later this would disappear. Now I am even afraid to even eat anything that isn't fruit, vegetable or bran and to drink anything that isn't water or juice.

Some distractions like music, working out or being around people work but at times it isn't enough. 

If anyone had a similar experience I would appreciate if you shared it with me. I am sorry for this post being so long."

18vu4ab,Anxiety,2024-01-01,Health anxiety triggered by post-viral complications,"Hi everyone,

Before I start, I've read the community rules, and understand that frequent reassurance posts are not allowed, however this is my first and only post here, as I don't know where else to post and who to talk to.

I'm a 27 year old male and I recently had Mono (glandular fever), and for the last 2-3 months or so I've been dealing with post-viral fatigue (unable to exercise like I used to, random breathlessness, tired all the time, general fatigue) and it has unusually affected my mental health (I've been told that Mono/other viruses can cause this). I used to be fairly physically active before all of this (gym 3-5 times a week, going on frequent walks, etc. and used to train Muay Thai and other martial arts before that for years). I should also mention that although I've vaped here and there, I am not a smoker, and don't really drink at all.

Ever since my symptoms I'd spend big chunks of time on Google/Reddit reading about anything and everything related further (although very low chance) complications such as Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, etc. and got myself worried. I ended up in hospital ER twice a few weeks back due to the fatigue and breathing issues, thinking I was dying, and have also seen a heart specialist. All test results have shown that my heart is 100% healthy, and lungs look fine, and have been told that I just need to rest and let the fatigue pass.

Today it is the 1st of January, and honestly when I woke up, I kind of started feeling anxious again as it is a new year, and it made me think of the fact that I'm aging (creeping up to 30), as well as potential future health complications.

I started reading about people with thicker waists being at higher risks for heart related issues, and read multiple places that if your waist is 40+ inches, you're high risk. So I measured my waist and it was just over 40 inches, and that obviously worried the hell out of me.

Some context; although I have a thick waist (due to my previous gym diet of eating high calorie numbers for weight/muscle gain) I do feel like I am generally fit elsewhere, i.e. arms, chest, legs, having more muscle mass/looking more fit, etc. And also, I was about 103kg (at 6ft height) a few months ago, and am now down to 97, so cutting the weight down somewhat fast.

Anyway, I guess what I'm looking for here are maybe some comforting words, because as silly as it sounds, I'm now stuck in an OCD loop of thinking because my waist is about 40 inches, there is no hope for me at this stage, and I'm bound for health complications, namely strokes etc. as I've made the mistake of reading some horror stories online. And because I'm dealing with post-viral complications, I can't really exercise right now, other than light walks, to help cut down the weight. :(

Any help/advice will be appreciated more than you'd know. &lt;3

P.S. Very sorry for the poorly structured post, my brain isn't really working at the moment.

Edit: I should also mention that I am currently in therapy, however I've only had about 3-4 sessions, mostly online, and I feel like I haven't really started to get anything too effective out of it as of yet. I understand that it takes time and patience."
18xs3nu,Anxiety,2024-01-03,Anxiety and overthinking,"Looking around my room while i was listening to YouTube and an add popped in with some wierd radio sound or idk how to explain (a song in a ""radio on the other corner of the room"") . It gave me anxiety and that keeps happening and i dont know the cause . 
Something that gets me scared is depersonalization and sometimes i think i have it but in reality no and when im lightheaded same thing , anxiety"
18x38w3,Anxiety,2024-01-02,Kinda blocked in this loop,"I'm 17 , since a kid i was complexed with everything around me and i always had a bad mood due to stuff that happened. 3 months ago i had my first terrible panick attack induced by me vaping and my vape dying . (I was very addicted)
Next day decided to quit nicotine forever and i can say im very very proud to be 3 months nicotine free .
I felt very out of this world and had crazy mental health issues because of the addiction and quitting it .
Now im somewhat stable but , life changed , i feel different , people around me feel different and when i refuse to think about stuff too much to not tigger a panick attack even though in the past it was never a problem.
My question is : how can i escape this loop , be happy , feel good with myself and have motivation?
I have to mention the biggest trigger for panic is fainting or the fear of fainting which will be triggered everytime i feel lightheaded ornat the gym which also wasnt a thing before"
18w28vi,Anxiety,2024-01-01,How can you ease an anxiety flare up after being anxiety free for so long?,"i managed to get my anxiety under wraps months ago and my mental health has never been better, i‚Äôm happy. however, there were some events last night that seem to have triggered my anxiety to come back.

being new years eve i reflected on my year and it made me think of my ex and the times we had together. it made me sad, which was weird because i‚Äôve been over him for about 4 months now and want nothing to do with him, but the memories really got to me. the night got worse as a family member was attacked by our ‚Äúfamily friend‚Äù (for no reason) and was given a broken nose, broken eye socket and is unrecognisable. it‚Äôs hard to see and not get upset. 

those things understandably made me anxious and upset but it was a shock to feel that way regarding the first thing, as i haven‚Äôt cared in so long. of course the second thing is distressing regardless. but, i‚Äôve noticed that things are bothering me again that usually wouldn‚Äôt. i had to share my bed last night which i usually don‚Äôt care about especially when it‚Äôs someone i know and am always close with, but i woke up feeling unclean (the person is perfectly hygienic), every little stupid thing is setting me off today and it‚Äôs worrying me. i have taught myself a lot since my breakup and my anxiety had pretty much vanished, i hope today is a one off and it doesn‚Äôt come back :( "

18x5312,Anxiety,2024-01-03,Recovering from massive breakdowns,"The first breakdown I ever really hadWho's my 1st day Of high school and I was so excited I wanted to see my friends and wanted to try my best in school and I was just all over just energetic. I was  Me I was myself I realized I meant to help probably wasn't the best butI was dealing with it really well Despite not having that much support .  This breakdown was caused by my mom just saying wrong thing"" How come you can't do this you're in what grade I can't believe you"" That is what I got when I asked for help on my  Math homework.It sounds stupid but it's seriously sent me into a downward spiral andMade me realize I didn't know what times tables and I was starting high school how was I ever going to make it in the real world.I couldn't sleep I couldn't go to school this was online and in school since it was 2020 And the 1st day I went into school I went to my math class I only got a problem in and I went to my next class and I had a mental breakdown and had to go home. I was that scared And it seriously f***** u* my life and I couldn't go back into school unless I was in one room Or else I would have a panic attack.I remember I would literally ask my Google Assistant how many days I had leftBecause it felt like I was going to fail and I was going to become home this when those days We're up. The next breakdown I had last year in February Basically I thought I was a horrible person and other people knew that  And I basically went on a apology  Ram page. If I remembered anything that was even slightly bad I would apologize to people it didn't matter how old it was I needed that forgiveness and if I didn't get it I would throw up. This led to me having anxiety so bad that I would throw up because I  Genuinely believed that people were going to find out how bad a s***** person I was and hurt me or publicly reject me. It was just not a good year And it took me this full year to recover from it And I was just sitting in class today  Spiraling again. I've been living under the mentality of make the most out of these years because these are probably the most fun you're ever going to have because you're not good enough for anything else. Basically I want to know why this has happened and does anyone have any coping tips because I'm starting to lose my mind here."
18x4els,Anxiety,2024-01-02,Fear of being left out,"f17) things are tougher than i expected them to be and i'm having a really hard time with feeling left out and alone. Due to anxiety of betrayal and just not so great interactions I don't trust my really close friends or I'm jealous of them . The  jealousy was about th4em being better than they were but now that I have processed my feelings I think it's mostly about feeling like I have to do all these fun things before I leave high school. I Turned 16 last year and I completely Didn't want to get my  Permit. I believed I was so stupid that I was going to hurt someone on the road and I just didn't really see a point in getting my Driver's license. Now I feel like I'm being left behind. All my friends are doing all these cool things and driving places Growing up And I feel like I'm just going to be stuck forever. I basically went to high school just to set my mind to have as much fun as you can because come see you're here you're not gonna know what to do with yourself. So I think that's why I couldn't hear you being Jealous of people. If they did something good that means they have a better opportunity than me, they're more hard-working than I am, and they have a better chance at a good  Future. If someone's really passionate about art I wish I was that passionate so maybe I could earn  Money and do what I love At the same time. That's the root of my jealousy. All these kids have these opportunities that they deserve and I don't have any opportunities because I don't deserve one. I think that's why I feel so down But it feels good to figure it out. What do I do now though? How do I deal with these feelings cause they're not just gonna go away."

18vtavc,Anxiety,2024-01-01,Why did I used to complain a lot when I was a kid?,"Hey guys, Happy New Years 2024! I wanna talk about a thing but I don‚Äôt want you guys to think I was a terrible human but I kinda complained a lot during my childhood especially when I was  in High School. I remember it was usually about the teachers I had in school. I made a post about teachers so if you wanna check, go ahead and tap the link. Things happed a lot during my 2nd semester of 10th grade. I kinda remember the reason why it became such a hellish loop is because I used to go to a go to a cram school to study from end of  8th grade because I had a entrance exam for High School so I joined there, pass the exam for my High School and it was the time for my first summer break in High School. We had snacks we are able to eat in my cram school as a reward for studying hard and being focused but that day, there wasn‚Äôt so many kids so me and the young staff were talking that soo many snacks are still left and I made a joke I could eat all because it could be a waste if you throw it to the garbage can and the young staff overreacted my joke and started to say something weird and I wasn‚Äôt able to say back because it was a young lady and I respected ladies more than men‚Äôs and didn‚Äôt want to hurt her feelings so I just kept still but my 2nd Semester just became a living hell. The teachers bossed me around like ***, I met lots of crazy people in the train of in the bus and lots more but I had quite a bad time that time. It was painful, depressing, and sometimes I thought I wanted to just give up. Luckily, I was able to finish the 2nd semester but it was extremely stressful so I became extremely frustrated and complained a lot. I didn‚Äôt complain on purpose but it came out during having a conversation with someone. I was like extremely anxious during my holiday from school for the whole time like counting down the days I start school again and meet the teachers there again and listening their insults. I think the other reason is that the holiday was short so I really didn‚Äôt liked it but I think my fear of teachers was probably extreme because I complained a lot about them. I don‚Äôt know but I think low self esteem, lack of confidence, or depression connects to extreme complaining."
190dgcd,Anxiety,2024-01-06,How More Couples/Women That Keep Choosing To Be Childfree Could Cause Humanity And Society To No Longer Exist Is A Bad Thing,"How will the existence of humanity, the existence of public establishments and the existence of parenthood be able to survive if more couples/women keep choosing not to procreate.  
The effects of more couples/women that keep choosing not to procreate could cause the existence of humanity, the existence of public establishments and the existence of parenthood to be at a risk of no longer existing anymore.  
The existence of humanity, the existence of public establishments and the existence of parenthood are all very important things for the future because  
1. Humans (including women) were created to reproduce in order to keep the human race existing for many years to come.  
2. Humans have gotten the chance and ability to create and invent so many unique and useful things ever since the human race began.  
3. Public establishments were meant to allow humans to have access to them and were only meant to be operating in an environment where humans are around.  
4. Parenthood was meant to be seen and created as something that is beautiful, delightful, rewarding, important, fulfilling and meaningful for a married couple to choose to experience.  
Since the existence of public establishments are included, Here are different types of public establishments that could be affected which are  
1. How places of business (like jobs, companies, corporations, and manufacturers) could be at a risk of no longer existing anymore if the amount of new people that choose to apply for jobs at businesses, companies, corporations and manufacturers and the amount of new people that buy items from manufacturers keeps decreasing because of more couples/women choosing not to procreate.  
2. How places of education (like schools, universities/colleges and tutoring services) could be at a risk of no longer existing anymore if the amount of new people that choose to apply for jobs as teachers/professors by teaching new students at schools and universities/colleges, the amount of new students that choose to go to universities/colleges and the amount of new children that need to go to schools and tutoring services to get an education keeps decreasing because of more couples/women choosing not to procreate.  
3. How places of healthcare (like hospitals, medical centres/clinics, dental clinics and pharmacies) could be at a risk of no longer existing anymore if the amount of new people that choose to apply for jobs as doctors/healthcare workers by recovering new patients at hospitals and medical centres/clinics, the amount of new people that choose to apply for jobs as dentists by recovering new patients at dental clinics and the amount of new people that need to get treatment at hospitals, medical centres/clinics, dental clinics and pharmacies keeps decreasing because of more couples/women choosing not to procreate.  
4. How places of retail (like malls, shopping centres/districts, stores and e-commerce retailers) could be at a risk of no longer existing anymore if the amount of new people that choose to visit malls and shopping centres/districts, the amount of new people that choose to shop at stores and retailers in-person and from online and the amount of new people that choose to apply for jobs at stores and for e-commerce retailers keeps decreasing because of more couples/women choosing not to procreate.  
5. How places of transportation (like airports, subway/LRT stations, and bus stations) could be at a risk of no longer existing anymore if the amount of new people that need or choose to use airports, subway/LRT stations and bus stations to go their destination keeps decreasing because of more couples/women choosing not to procreate.  
6. How places of sports (like recreation/leisure/aquatic centres, gyms, fitness centres, parks and playgrounds) could be at a risk of no longer existing anymore if the amount of new people that need to exercise or choose to spend time at recreation/leisure/aquatic centres, gyms, fitness centres and parks and the amount of new children that go to playgrounds keeps decreasing because of more couples/women choosing not to procreate.  
7. How places of tourism (like museums, movie theatres/cinemas, entertainment centres/venues, amusement parks/carnivals and water parks) could be at a risk of no longer existing anymore if the amount of new people that choose to go to museums, movie theatres/cinemas, entertainment centres/venues, amusement parks/carnivals and water parks keeps decreasing because of more couples/women choosing not to procreate.  
8. How places of hospitality (like restaurants/food establishments, hotels/resorts, and daycares/childcare facilities) could be at a risk of no longer existing anymore if the amount of new people that choose to dine at restaurants/food establishments, the amount of new people that need or choose to stay at hotels/resorts, and the amount of new children that need to go to daycares/childcare facilities keeps decreasing because of more couples/women choosing not to procreate."

I think I'm going to have a heart attack,"I'm (20M) I discovered I had depression at 14, I started seeing psychologists but I never took any medication, at 16 the panic attacks started, I started taking several medications for anxiety, depression, and anti-psychotics such as fluvoxamine, escitalopram and quetiapine. I took it until I was 18 and stopped because I felt like a zombie, I couldn't do anything ''cool'' with my life while taking the medication, I stopped therapy and stopped going to the doctors and started focusing on myself. \]

It's been resolving for 2 years, but now, out of nowhere the panic attacks started, I've been having chest pain for about 2 weeks, almost eternal, but they gradually get worse at night, shortness of breath, I feel like ''pins and needles'' in my chest . Earlier today, New Year's Eve, I started to get dizzy and lose my balance, I don't have any heart problems other than the arrhythmia, I monitor it every year and my doctor says that anxiety is always to blame.

I'm doing everything, what I've always done without medication, and nothing is helping, I stopped drinking and using drugs 1 year ago, I eat well, I do heart exercises every day, I had regular sleep until this started, I try occupy my mind so as not to cause any type of anxiety, but none of that seems to work. I feel like I'm going to die at any moment from a heart attack or heart failure, die in my sleep, or have a painful death. I haven't been able to sleep well for days, and today, coincidentally, I can't even sleep. I don't know what to do to improve this, I would go back to taking my medication in peace but where I live it's a holiday and there's no way to make appointments because of the ''New Year''.

then there's the anxiety about having to sit through a 6 hour class. i have anxiety when i get hungry bc of trauma and it can to the point of a panic attack, and i also get anxious if i can't use the bathroom because i feel trapped. i know it sounds crazy but it can be really debilitating. if i pass out or something from hunger it might mess up the class and then i might not get my certificate of completion. idk. im packing food and stuff but i just don't know how much freedom ill have to come and go and it makes me rly nervous. add onto all of that that im a recovering agoraphobe and being outside of my house at all makes me feel unsafe. it's rly just not a fun time.

i know that in reality, ive been able to handle similar things before and i should be able to do it again, but im so afraid of HAVING anxiety that it's GIVING me anxiety. that seems to be what's making me the most anxious rn. breathing exercises don't really seem to work that well for me, so i don't know what to do to calm down. what can i do to be less afraid of having anxiety? i have SUCH a hard time coping with pressure because im terrified that ill have an anxiety attack and mess everything up."

It‚Äôs not healthy for someone to have this mind for years, my heart isn‚Äôt supposed to be fucking beating this fast for years. it‚Äôs really hard to explain all of this in a paragraph. I took a long drive after my class a couple days ago and was just thinking about, all of this.

&amp;#x200B;

Long story short, always been anxious, never had a panic attack or anything like it before june of last year. Since then, it's a constant battle with everything I feel from the arm, the neck or the chest. It's slowly making me go crazy. I know I won't have a heart attack. It's normal to feel your heart. It's normal to feel it go faster when you move, digest your dinner etc etc, but man, my brain doesn't give a single F about this. 

''I feel something'' Must be a problem. Oh! He doesn't react, let's make it harder to resist and then BAM! I feel a little pain in my arm or my neck or a little chest pain. My cardiologist told me that everything was alright and I know that my problem is more and more deep in my mind, but it seems that after 7 months even with a therapy to help me controls my emotions, it doesn't work.

What is your story. Ever felt this curse?"
18zkwq7,Anxiety,2024-01-05,Healthy anxiety,"Hi, please help me Reddit strangers.

I will preface this by saying I had a year of intense therapy to deal with everything I‚Äôll blurt out below but that was about 4 years ago now. 

Basically, I am mid 30s. I have had over 50 surgeries and procedures because of my Crohn‚Äôs and now have a permanent ileostomy. I have a wonderful husband and the sweetest 4YO son. 

My health anxiety is just at an all time high. I am terrified of something happening to my son or my husband - specifically bowel cancers in my husband and just anything I read about children and unexpected death for my son.

I‚Äôm terrified I‚Äôm going to die early or that I have cancer. I‚Äôm scheduled an MRI and have had some blood work done because my Crohn‚Äôs is pretty rough right now (vomiting, pain) and I‚Äôm just terrified.

I don‚Äôt want to live like this but I don‚Äôt know how to shake it. I‚Äôm just so scared - usually at night - I have no idea what to do next. I can‚Äôt afford my old therapist again. I know I have taken all the steps to sort out my current health issues and just have to wait. I am on anti medication but because of my high output stoma I am wondering if I‚Äôm having issues absorbing the full dose which may be impacting me.

Any suggestions would be well received! I‚Äôve never posted on anything like this before so I feel a bit ‚Äòlaid bare‚Äô as I think in real life no one would expect this of me!"

18yggsy,Anxiety,2024-01-04,Concerned about my health,"So back in August 2022 I developed agoraphobia and stopped leaving the house. That led to me not being very active and pretty much just sitting around all the time. 

I gained about 30 pounds from November 2022 - April 2023. I‚Äôm very concerned about this weight gain. I wouldn‚Äôt have really considered myself to be very active before I got agoraphobia, I may have gone out more meaning I was getting some steps in but I never really worked out. I held steady at the same weight for 2 almost 3 years. So gaining 30 pounds in such a short amount of time seems really odd. I wasn‚Äôt eating any different than I normally do to be honest. I wasn‚Äôt eating good, I would eat out and all that. But that‚Äôs kind of always how I‚Äôve always been. Not only did I gain all that weight I have purple stretch marks around my belly button area and a little further down. Those are also concerning me. 

I‚Äôve changed my diet and eat so much better now. Less carbs and sugar, no eating out. I don‚Äôt eat pasta, bread, or rice (too high in carbs). I haven‚Äôt lost a single pound. I had some lab work back in August and everything came back normal but I‚Äôm concerned I might have something hormonal going on. My mom has hypothyroidism and hormonal issues runs in family, every woman in my family has a hormonal issue. My doctor said it was stupid to check a 19 year olds hormones because I‚Äôm ‚Äútoo young‚Äù. My mom had to have surgery for endometriosis at 19‚Ä¶ so I‚Äôm definitely not too young. 

I just don‚Äôt know what to do. I haven‚Äôt felt like myself at all either. I don‚Äôt feel my emotions like I used to. I just feel off. I wish my doctor would take me seriously because I just feel like something is not right. Also all this extra weight is making me feel disgusting. I genuinely hate myself which doesn‚Äôt help with the agoraphobia. I already didn‚Äôt like the weight I was at and this extra weight is killing me."

I genuinely feel like my brain has broken. The ruminating thoughts never stop, I‚Äôm always scared. Everything feels unreal / strange. I cannot connect with anything or be present, my mind just spins all the time. I can‚Äôt focus or be present. I‚Äôm exhausted all the time.

I was diagnosed with complex ptsd but don‚Äôt know how to heal. I‚Äôve lost all my emotions and feelings. Therapy will help temporarily but these thoughts never stop. The feeling strange and like I want to jump out of my skin never stops. The fear of being unsafe never stops.  

I‚Äôve become severely numb to the point where just getting through the day feels impossible, but somehow I grit my teeth through it. I never even knew feeling like this was humanly possible. I was on Lexapro for a year and it wasn‚Äôt helping, now I‚Äôve been on Zoloft almost 2 months, it‚Äôs helped turn down some of the intrusive thoughts but they still torture me daily. I also get hopeless thoughts about how living life where you can‚Äôt feel is pointless, and it‚Äôs pointless to feel like your mind is at war with reality every single day. I had a happy and great life before this, this last year has been such hell mentally. I just want myself back, it feels like my brain is fried and doesn‚Äôt work like everyone else‚Äôs.

I understand why it exists but why is it so goddamn irritating? there's no way I can do this another year. Why would you start school  halfway through the week after winter break and expect everybody not to come back tired and annoyed. Why not just push it to the next week? Why do the teachers act like they're the shit and pretend like students can't make mistakes?

 Thinking of school makes me physically fucking ill the thought of waking at 6am just to get ready and stay at a place idgaf about for 7 hours straight and the only break I get is at lunch. Why is school the best place to find fake ass friends?

 Why can't I never stay on track even when I slept hella early the night before? Why are all the students carbon copies of each other and have a lame attitude towards some people? Why do all the sport kids have an attitude, they act like they're better than every other bitch at school? Why are there fights every 3 days? Like wtf type of planet is this? at the end we all have no choice and were  work machines for the government and it makes me so mad.

18wsnne,Anxiety,2024-01-02,How to get over being told off at work?,"For the first time in my life I'm actually pretty comfortable with my job (other jobs I would constantly dread going in because I was terrified of being sick and/or passing out in public). I get paid well, like my coworkers and boss, etc. It's a small family business so it's nice even though I've only been there since October.

I'm an alarm handler (for alarm systems, NOT 911), which sounds stressful but it's actually the most chill job I've had. But today I came into work and was told I handled a fire alarm incorrectly. He'd printed out the records of the alarm where I'd called dispatch, received a restoration, and told dispatch so the fire department wasn't actually sent out. He just told me to dispatch anyways in the future and not tell the operator that the alarm restored (with the idea that the alarm panel could've been affected by a fire, though this particular one was a frequent false signal known to the site and other operators).

That was it, it was such a small thing, but I still just feel so bad and anxious about being in trouble. I already know I'm gonna be up at night thinking about this for a while. Does anyone have any tips (or commisseration lol) about getting over it?"

18w5h1o,Anxiety,2024-01-01,A Surprising Turn of Events: Overcoming Fear in an Unexpected Solo Adventure in San Francisco,"During Christmas 2022, I found myself on a solo adventure in San Francisco, marking my second visit to the U.S. but my first solo journey. As someone grappling with Generalized Anxiety Disorder and hypochondria, I've always been unnerved by sudden increases in heart rate and blood pressure.

On a whim, I decided to experiment with weed, choosing a strain with low THC and high CBD, hoping it would ease my anxiety. Unfortunately, the experience went south. While in a cab back to my hotel, the effects of the joint hit me ‚Äì my heart raced, breathing became difficult, and I felt trapped in my mind. The language barrier with the Chinese cab driver compounded my panic, as I couldn't convey my urgent need to get to a hospital. Stepping out of the cab, I frantically sought help from passersby. A woman, seemingly overseeing a porta-potty, came to my aid, trying to reassure me that it was just a panic attack, not a heart attack as I feared.

The situation escalated to the point where paramedics were called, despite the woman's concerns about the potential cost for what she believed was just a bad reaction. Dehydrated and anxious, I was prohibited from drinking water due to some protocol until I reached the hospital. In the ambulance, the paramedics reassured me it wasn't a heart attack, frequently checking if hospitalization was necessary.

Curiously, I started monitoring my heart rate and blood pressure, observing their fluctuations. Engaging in a mental game to control my heart rate, I unexpectedly confronted a long-held fear. For years, I had avoided any medical checks of my heart rate or blood pressure due to a past traumatic episode. This harrowing experience, albeit dramatic, surprisingly helped me overcome this fear.

Ultimately, I insisted on going to the hospital, which resulted in a bill of $1,000 to $2,000. Reflecting on the ordeal, I'm grateful to the strangers who didn't judge a panicking foreigner and to the paramedics and the woman who earnestly tried to save me from unnecessary expenses. This bizarre, anxiety-filled episode turned out to have a silver lining after all."

18vpoqy,Anxiety,2024-01-01,Anxious that social circle ignores me for no reason 22F,"For the past 3 years, i've (22F) been living in a small town without a single real buddy. I moved here because my old city statistically wasnt good crime wise, thinking i‚Äôd be in for a better life here‚Ä¶Ever since moving here, i‚Äôve made a huge effort to create a social circle of pals, mostly with fellow women my age. I‚Äôve been attending lots of social gatherings in town, events, joined local community groups, facebook social groups in my area, but literally nothing has worked when it comes to meeting new people. I‚Äôm always the one having to gently approach these people and strike up a conversation, or else nobody speaks to me. I smile at every one, i dont have a mean look on my face, i dont smell bad, i enjoy making every person feel welcome, yet i‚Äôm ignored. I present myself well in a classy yet laidback manner, i have respect for everyone, and i truly enjoy making people smile with compliments that arent creepy or overbearing. Yet, it seems like this just isnt enough for them. I wouldve thought fellow women my age in this town would like to speak with me or would be open to a new gal pal, but no. Its really suprising for me.   
I do my very best to talk &amp; strike up a conversation, i like making every person feel included. But when the social gatherings are done, they dont speak to me at all afterwards &amp; completely ignore me. I‚Äôm never spoken to, i‚Äôm never text, never invited out, or given a damn about by these people. I‚Äôm always the one having to invite these people out places, or else they dont invite me out at all &amp; i feel like i‚Äôm stuck in my room. I love going out to fun places and living life, but its hard always being the one asking people to go out or else they dont give a hoot to invite me anywhere. I‚Äôm always just ignored by these people.   
Whenever i add ‚Äúfriends‚Äù on my facebook i get no conversation, no nothing. My messages inbox is totally empty. Nobody ever texts me first, asks me how i‚Äôm doing or how my day has been, nothing. I‚Äôm always the one having to text first, then they dont ever text me again when i literally did nothing wrong. I post pictures of myself often (i‚Äôm a makeup artist too so i enjoy dolling my face up &amp; dressing nice when i go out), yet nobody comments anything nice on my pics not even a compliment, when i compliment them on their photos.   
Let me add, i‚Äôve done absolutely nothing, literally nothing wrong whatsoever to make people want to avoid speaking to me or have any reason to dislike me. I am not being full of myself at all, but i do take care of myself well &amp; take pride in carrying myself well, i have a small business doing nails, i enjoy dressing nice &amp; doing up my hair n' makeup, so i will admit this has attracted lots of jealously from people. I never show off, i‚Äôm always very inclusive &amp; i welcome everyone with open arms. So it breaks my heart i‚Äôm constantly being treated like i‚Äôm invisible.   
I thought i did have a buddy whom i met on facebook not far from my town, she would comment nice stuff on my phtotos and would text me‚Ä¶Until completely out of nowhere she began cancelling plans when we never met in-person before &amp; only kept asking me for money, then wouldnt speak me to when i was unable to give her money. So i got tired of her constantly only asking me for my money then ignoring me when i couldnt give her any, so i blocked her off &amp; that was it. Since then, my social circle has been so unsuccesful and i know for a fact its not my fault at all.   
I am tired of always being kind, always being kind, and having so much qualities to offer, yet always being treated like a ghost in return.... I really wish i had a buddy but i truly feel so anxious, depressed and let down always trying to meet people but ignored like this.   
Its been years since living in this small town &amp; at the moment i‚Äôm unable to move out, or else i‚Äôd totally be out of here. I wake up with awful anxiety every morning &amp; a huge contributor is what I'm going through with not having any buddies. "

Whenever my shift starts i get over the anxiety im feeling and i end up feeling good at the end of the night but when im at home, im stressing all the time over the next time i have to show up. my brain knows theres nothing to be anxious over but my body doesnt care. I think its a multitude of reasons, being away from my home and family for so long so often, or working late so whenever i do finally get home, everyones asleep, or being so far that i feel so disconnected from what im used to and it makes me homesick(which is a problem ive always had, as a kid i couldnt even stay at a house just across the street overnight"". Im sure itll go away with time as it has before with every single job ive had, this anxiety being the reason i quit all but 2(this job included) jobs. I just dont know how long itll be til i feel better or until i cant take it and quit. This is exacerbated by the feeling of not being able to quit and having to deal it, i say feeling because its not fact, i know i can quit if i want to but i feel personally obligated to commit to a job again. I talked with my mom and even she said that if i need to quit then quit because mental health is more important than any job. but regardless i get anxiety to the point where im crying on the way there because i feel alone. it feels embarrassing to say out loud why but i need it to stop as soon as possible and i havent found any natural remedies that work. i cant even play games with my friends without the lingering feeling in the back of my head, body, everywhere. which is wild because playing with the boys got me through worse things like my breakup. i know itll all go away if my brother gets scheduled so we can go to work and home together, but they havent given him a training day or even a login email for the work app, but they did say he should get a day this coming week so thats good at face value. i just cant get my hopes up on them following through so i want to get past this feeling myself just in case and i dont know how yet"

18vlpzn,Anxiety,2024-01-01,Anxiety after eating?,"Hi everyone, I'm 22F. I've suffered from anxiety my whole life. I've had a very good handle on it for a while, but ever since I had covid recently it's been worse. I've had covid before about 2 years ago, and this didn't happen then. This time around I did end up vomiting one night, and i've done it plenty of times in the past. Of course it's not pleasant, but it happens. 
Ever since then, any time I eat I start having a panic attack after I'm done. I'm not over eating or anything, I'm actually eating slower to make sure I'm not. I'm just wondering if this has ever happened to someone else? I'm losing sleep over it now as it doesn't go away for a while. The panic attacks are bad enough to have me seated in front of the toilet in fear i'm either going to vomit, faint, or blow out the other end. 
If it helps, I'm also on 10mg lexapro. 

Any advice greatly appreciated!!!"
18vlk8b,Anxiety,2024-01-01,How to get over Regrets about specific things I didn‚Äôt do earlier,"So I don‚Äôt know what to call this other than anxiety abt small things or ‚Äúmicro-anxiety‚Äù, but yeah I could use some advice on kicking it. It‚Äôs gonna sound really stupid

Anyway for context I (19M) seem to keep thinking about, and getting bugged, annoyed even upset about the fact that I hadn‚Äôt watched specific shows or listened to certain music that‚Äôs good in my taste earlier in my tween/teenage years. (Ex random examples wishing I had watched Game of Thrones earlier, I recently started it, or had actually listened to Radiohead more earlier). A big part of the reason for this is when other people my age know about/already enjoyed these things and I feel behind, left out, like I missed out.

I know or at least think it‚Äôs small and insignificant but it keeps bugging me, and it spirals into a broader issue where I wish I could or would have done things differently in the past, and general regrets I have about my whole last 7 years of life. I question my identity based on not doing certain things earlier. Then of course I have more serious life regrets to. 

In general what are good strategies and just a new way to think that‚Äôll help me move beyond big and small regrets? I know meditation, spending time in nature, hobbies, and especially journaling about the specific things I regret helps me, but even after doing these things the thoughts come back, what should I do?

I have OCD btw so I know I can continually have obsessive thoughts abt things and it‚Äôs best to just kind of let them happen.

TLDR: How can I get over small and big regrets? Be more present and worry less abt the past and future."
18vlife,Anxiety,2024-01-01,my mind is blank,"Hello, all! I have been in therapy since around May 2023. What caused me to seek therapy was anxiety, with some specific focus on driving anxiety. As therapy has progressed, me and my therapist have identified that I have a general fear of failure and the unknown, as well as said driving anxiety. My main issue is that in the earlier sessions we would use a sort of CBT framework to try and crack my anxious thoughts, but it seemed like there were none. Like, when I'm anxious, I'm not thinking, I'm just anxious. This was interesting to my therapist, and after a bit we came to the conclusion that something is really guarding my anxious thoughts, and that I dissociate quite a bit as well when emotion comes to the surface for me. Additionally, I seem to have poor awareness of my own anxiety until it is very intense. For example, I won't realize something is making me anxious until I'm super close to having to do it, and have a more intense anxiety response to it as it gets closer and closer. Whenever I'm prompted to come up with the thought behind my anxiety, it feels like a guess. It doesn't feel like I'm saying something accurate to me, per se, and instead it just feels like I'm creating a thought that I assume would be an anxious thought. This created roadblocks in using CBT, and we have since done more of an exposure therapy thing focusing on driving, which seems to work better, but leaves my other anxiety themes unaddressed. This is further complicated by the fact that I can't even really feel that I know what my own anxiety is triggered by, and I feel like my mind is blank. My internal monologue isn't anxious, and I can only create a hypothesis to why I'm anxious if heavily prompted. I don't have any spontaneous anxious thoughts, or really much spontaneous thought at all. It literally feels like I'm just coasting on autopilot until my therapist essentially makes me confront what could \*possibly\*, \*maybe\* be making me anxious. I am not sure if this really makes much sense at all, or if anyone relates. Honestly I don't even know what my goal in writing this was - I guess just to write down something that has been quietly nagging at me for a while. If you have any insight as to how I may increase my awareness of my anxiety or even just a similar experience I would love to hear!"

18vkf9y,Anxiety,2023-12-31,A problem I have,"Try to be quick with it.

I tend to make new accounts for social platforms all the time and try to avoid looking at anything I texted or did in the past. It doesn't matter if it's 10 minutes or 10 years. I get a lot of anxiety looking at anything I have made and especially others people's reaction to it.

Real examples:
1. Make a new Instagram account and posting couple pictures and not being able to ever look at them or look at my profile and making new account and the loop continues.

2. Messaging a friend and next day trying to cover my past sent text message so I can't see them

3. Doing a big school project and delaying it as much as possible because I can't look what I have done already.

4. Can't look at my posts on reddit and their comments at all without major anxiety and discomfort.

I think I tend to regret everything I do even if it's good or bad. Anyone else feel like this or has advice?"

i (23M) since i was 13 i have been though a lot of trauma.. i have been though severe depression a social anxiety , loneliness, overthinking, insomnia..
that made me realise my life won't change and i won't get what i want i knew it won't get better for me i knew my life won't change to be better i knew my limits that I can't change my life and all that at a young age.

so i tried to be more social since im intervort and i had social anxiety i wanted to make friends so they could help me at the hard times but they weren't always there for me i felt always alone i felt hopeless i didn't know what to do. 

so i decided to end it at a young age but i remembered that im so young and my life is just at its beginning why i would do something like that i don't have enough knowledge about this world i gotta grow up and meet new ppl and make new acquaintances and specially friends close ones that can help me though life also to have a goal a dream that will give me hope makes me want to live and leave everything upsets me behind why i bother myself with something that already happened.

so i moved on with my life giving myself a hope my life would change i used to listen to this motivational quotes tomorrow will be better , there's light at the end of the tunnel there's hope..

i did want to believe it i did want to change my life to be better though i knew deep inside it won't so I tried to be more social i tried to be nice with anyone i tried to be more positive I hopped for better tomorrow at the end..

i couldn't achieve anything not a single thing i was alone depressed realising that it only got worse for me my social anxiety couldn't let me get close friends i was even ignoring any social encounter my loneliness didn't change a bit less even i think i was wasting time lying to myself it will get better..

After adjusting I‚Äôve been really tired, even more than on 25mg. Stool has been awful and then just discomfort in the stomach. Fast forward to yesterday were I was just really tired and spent most of the day in the bed, I at night felt really hungry and hadn‚Äôt been eating well earlier (or in general, I‚Äôm really bad at it) and it may have caused a little low blood sugar and mixed with anxiety, it really just went into a shitshow. One of the worst feelings is of course the feeling like you are about to faint and headache. I did then get to sleep and today have been soo weird. Woke up so confused and like out of my body (but not quite) and hungry. I spent most of the day in the bed, thinking and feeling bad about myself and crying - really went into a dark spiral. I thought was going insane or something. While also being hungry, sad, heavy headed and the feeling you are about to faint / pass out, it just got too much and I cried for so long. Was feeling down, useless and unwanted, stupid and all of those things. I did initially call the right people and talked with some really nice people. She reassured me those symptoms mentioned (feeling out of mind, about to faint and the heavy headed) was such common symptoms. I am more relaxed and calm, but that really made my day. I was so afraid to go or be insane and be mentally ill (or what you call it - different person).

18vimgy,Anxiety,2023-12-31,Gabapentin &amp; L-Theanine cause anxiety?,"Hi all. So, question. I was on gabapentin for about a year to treat pain from a physical issue, and during that time my suicidal thoughts skyrocketed. I can't remember exactly how bad the anxiety I experience was while I was on it, but when I stopped taking it (didn't taper, obviously should have), I experienced pretty extreme rebound anxiety. I couldn't go on a walk more than half a block from my home without having to call my husband to come get me. This kind of extreme anxiety lasted for several weeks. A few years prior to this, I had tried taking L-Theanine for a few months. When I would first take it, I experienced lowered levels of anxiety, but then as it wore off, they'd be higher than ever. It was like the anxiety baseline rose dramatically. I actually had my worst ever panic attack while on l-theanine, resulting in my not being able to sleep for a little over 48 hours, with my heart racing the whole time. Needless to say, I got off of it. But with both the L-Theanine and the gabapentin, it felt like I had residual panic for almost a year after quitting each one. 

It just feels like the things that are supposed to calm me down actually make me worse, and take a very long time to work their way out of my system. I've had mixed results with taking chamomile, sam-e, and 5htp, and some luck with tryptophan. When I talk to my healthcare providers about it, I feel a little dismissed, or maybe as though they view me as a hypochondriac.

Has anyone else ever had supplements or drugs that are supposed to help quell anxiety actually make it so much worse? What has worked for you? Has anyone else had residual panic from supplements that lasted a long time after they stopped taking them?

I am curious about possibly taking something long-term to help with the anxiety I experience, but I'm very put off by my past experiences."

18vhi0j,Anxiety,2023-12-31,Does Anxiety Ever Get Better? Does Therapy/and or Medication Actually Help?,"Hello, everyone.

This is somewhat of a rant, though I am curious if anyone has gotten better after going to therapy and/or beginning to take medication for their anxiety.

I am a 32M and I've had anxiety for as long as I can remember, though my worries have changed over the years. I was always worried about different things growing up, but it wasn't until I turned 18 that my anxiety took a turn for the worse. Between the ages of 18 - 24, my anxiety progressed into agoraphobia, which resulted in me not leaving my house for this stretch of time (there were stretches of time during these 6 years that I couldn't even leave my bedroom). I don't know what happened, but one day I just stopped worrying about going outside and went out. While agoraphobia took 6 years of my life away from me, I've since lived a productive life. I've achieved my Bachelor's degree, got married, am successful in my career, bought a house, and my wife and I have two wonderful children together, but my anxiety is still there, just in a different form..

Since my wife and I got married, my anxiety shifted to health anxiety, primarily the fear that I have cancer. Over the past 8 years, I've convinced myself that I've had every form of cancer because I feel achy in a certain area, or I feel a bump. For the past 2 years, my primary fear has been testicular cancer as a family friend died from the disease in his 20s. As a result, every time I feel achy down there, I immediately think I have this form of cancer. I also keep doing self exams to the point where I get sore down there. I never feel any lumps, but if I don't find anything I think to myself, ""I must have done it wrong. Let me check again."" or I'll check an area that feels a bit sensitive or tender (the latter possibly being from checking so much) and I'll immediately begin to panic. I keep telling myself that I'm fine, I have no pain down there (aside from the sensitivity and or tender feeling every now and then), but never any actual pain... and no lumps.... but I can't help convincing myself that I have testicular cancer. And whats annoying as hell is that if I wasn't worried about testicular cancer, I'd be worried about another form of cancer, constantly checking for that one.

While my health anxiety is enough to deal with, I also have severe white coat syndrome, as well. While I'm petrified of there being something wrong with me health wise; I'm even more afraid of going to a doctor and for them to actually confirm that there is something wrong with me, and then putting an expiration date on me.  The last time I went to the doctor for a physical was in the Fall 2015. Everything was fine then, but I haven't been able to push myself to go since. Since the Fall of 2015, I've only been sick twice (not including the seasonal common cold), both times with COVID. I check my temperature regularly and during that time, I've only had a fever twice, both times coming when I had COVID. Aside from needing to lose a little bit of weight, I'd say that I'm in okay health, and I'm constantly trying to tell myself that... but it doesn't work most days and I'm just fed up with it.

I do live a productive life, though a lot of it comes as a result of me pushing my anxiety down during the day. I have to work, take care of my family, etc... so when I'm busy with that stuff, I push my anxiety down to where I can only focus on the aforementioned tasks. However, when I have a moment to myself or some free time, my anxiety consumes me and my worries (at this point, my health anxiety) to where every free moment I get is just me sitting around worrying and its becoming upsetting. I think a lot of my health anxiety stems from my time with agoraphobia. Agoraphobia took 6 years of my life from me. Now that I've got my life on track and I have everything that I've always wanted, I fear that some disease will take it all away from me. That said disease will make it so I can't grow old with my wife, to watch my kids grow up, etc.. I don't know... at this point I'm just rambling.

So if you've made it this far, thank you for reading my rant. Now comes my question:

Does therapy and/or medication actually help? In 2024, I want to try and tackle this anxiety. To start, I want to begin talking with a doctor that specializes in treating anxiety, then I want to go and actually get a physical to put all my health anxiety worries to bed.

With therapy and/or medication, did you find that it changed your life? I want to be able to just stop worrying and feeling like this when it comes to my health. I want to be one of those people that actually goes to the doctor instead of not going out of fear that something may be wrong. If I did find something on me (i.e., a lump from a self exam), I want to be like one of those people I've read about where they book an appointment the next day to get it checked, rather than avoiding it entirely as the fear or knowing outweighs what it could possibly be. I just want to stop worrying and feeling this way. I just want to live a normal life.

18vgwul,Anxiety,2023-12-31,Shortness of Breath 24/7,"Hi everyone.

I'm hoping for some input and possible help in terms of finding out what's going on with me.

Around 6 months ago I had sudden shortness of breath around 2 weeks before a holiday I was going on. The night before the holiday I had a bad episode where it felt like I couldn't breath and had the paramedics out.

They concluded that it was a panic attack and that I was fine (they ran oxygen tests and whatnot). I went to my GP after my holiday and he prescribed me PPIs under the assumption of Silent Reflux. 

The PPIs didn't help really and the second batch I began taking made me ill so I stopped them. I'm currently on more which are better for my stomach but still getting bouts of SOB.

I've come to this subreddit because for the last month I've had really bad social anxiety about going outside and I've got it in my head that a cause for all of this could just be that I was anxious originally. 

I've always been an anxious person but not to the point of breathing difficulties. 

I'm an avid Airsofter so I enjoy going out and doing sports. It seems that the shortness of breath disappears when I'm not focused on it

Can it just happen out of nowhere and can it be a constant even though I don't feel anxious? Or could it be reflux related instead. 
(Don't think it is as it came out of nowhere)

Sorry for the long read. 

Thank you."

I've been feeling like this for a while, actually ever since my life got more stable. I have this feeling that something bad will happen to me because why would I deserve to feel good and stable? I've met with an old friend yesterday who's going through a lot in life and I just felt so ashamed of myself I avoided saying that things were alright, and again I got hit by that feeling of impending doom.

Recently I've also been thinking about death and seeing signs of it here and there, and it's a subject that generally scares me. My SO had a dream about it, the same friend I saw yesterday mentioned an acquaintance of hers who recently lost her partner, and this gave me a huge panic attack yesterday. I took it for a sign that something will definitely happen to me or SO soon and this just destroyed me.

For those who went through these feelings of doom and close death, did something actually happen? Was it intuition or mainly irrational fear and anxiety?"

After all these years and I myself having the monkey of monkey minds what I have learnt is that the key is focus on the feeling of your breathing and not focusing on trying to not have thoughts.

So I would do coherence breathing

https://youtu.be/ATyEtrjS4dw?si=16kKrCsCMX3GhVWH

For me this helps me get into the meditative state far more easily than doing no thought.

Physiological sigh

https://youtu.be/kSZKIupBUuc?si=PDw12IOf7hfpXc_L

Also I have done a Vipassana 10 day silent meditation. The first three days are all about feeling the sensation of the air going in and out of your nose.

For 10 hours. You focus on your breathing.

When I get people to do breathing exercises and breathwork. It becomes far easier to do meditation. Over time of course.

 Ive dealt with anxiety disorders since i was 12. 

I posted a few weeks ago about having a small health problem (constipation that hurt and gave me hemorrhoids) and freaking out after searching online for some suggestions on dealing with it because my wife passed away from colon cancer a couple years ago and the internet makes you think you have everything. Then when i was starting to feel at ease, I received an unsolicted Cologuard test in the mail( i am 49), and it srnt me over the edge. I went to urgent care, and she saw the hemorrhoid and perscribed stuff and i felt a bit better. 

The problem I'm having is that my stomach hasnt been perfect since. I concentrate constantly on my bowel movements (which have been ok overall) and any little pain i feel on my stomack or lower back and panicking. 

I have had GERD and diabetes for years, plus my family has always had stomach issues and ofcourse have dealt with stomach problems before but i can't get myself to relax and realize everything is probably fine, just my nerves making it worse. When i am not thinking about it, i tend to feel nothing wrong, but when i do think about it. I get gassy, feel little pains all around my mid section , etc..

I have an appt with my GP this week and hopefully she'll b e able to calm me down a bit."

18ve7rx,Anxiety,2023-12-31,Stuck in DR,"
I'm really struggling. I have OCD.  I've experienced dpdr several times before, and I usually came out of it within 2 weeks or so, but this time feels so real and so alarming and I cannot shake it. 

I had a panic attack last Friday (before Christmas) that started my derealization feelings. I have tried to accept the thoughts (maybe nothing is real,maybe it is) , I have tried to challenge the thoughts (if nothing was real, then how could _____ happen?) , and I have tried to sit with the anxiety caused by agreeing with the thoughts (okay fine. So you made it all up. What now? What's the point?). 

I can't even get through a grounding exercise without the thoughts intruding. For example, I'll start with touch and think ""I'm touching the seat in the car. That I made up. This isn't real. How do I even know this grounding technique will work? I made that up to. I probably made up OCD and all the coping mechanisms I've ever tried."" 

Part of me knows somewhere deep down that this is just one of OCDs many tricks to stick around, but I cannot see a way out of this. 

I am on Zoloft 200mg, and I've been taking Vistaril 2x a day, but I know the anxiety is still high because even laying here and typing this my feet are sweating like crazy. I don't know what to do. I feel trapped for good this time.

The minute I try to do things, even talking to my kids or husband, I'm like ""omg I made all this up, what is the point if it's all stuff I made up"" and it fills me with panic."

1. Have edibles (namely the indica or purely CBD blends) elicited a similar calming response to clonazapom/benzos?
2. Are there any other medications that have worked for you in addition to  an SNRI/SSRI such as an antipsychotic that reduced your general anxiety and illicited that ""sedative"" effect?
3. Are there any other options i should consider, i should add that I am open to nearly anything at this point.

18vcpqk,Anxiety,2023-12-31,Zoloft causes anxiety in autistic teenager due to increasing norepinephrine,"My son has autism. He had self-injurious behaviors since age of 3y. We tried many drugs and supplements but nothing helped with that until we started Zoloft at 25mg at age of 9y. It was a miracle drug. The SIBs stopped and the mood stabilized. In recent years, we tried different ADHD meds to improve his attention, starting with Focalin, which worked moderately well, and then switching to Qelbree earlier this year, first at 100mg and then raising it to 300mg. Qelbree worked well at the beginning, making my son calmer and more focused. He even stopped flapping his hands, which never happened before. We had to wean him off Zoloft per doctor advice. About 4-5 months into Qelbree, our son started complaining about racing heart, chest pains, and intrusive negative thoughts. He couldn't focus on anything because of preoccupation with his negative thoughts. Any school demand would stress him a lot, causing anger outbursts. The school psychologist defined it as anxiety. We weaned him off Qelbree. He slowly became happier, but low threshold to stress continued. SIBs and hand flapping came back. After 5 months off Qelbree and slow improvements in mood, we decided to try Zoloft again, at 25mg. The first 2-3 days he was OK, became calmer, deeper thoughts, more meaningful conversations. And then racing thoughts, anxiety and inability to focus came back as  on Qelbree. I found out that Zoloft, besides being an SSRI, also blocks norepinephrine transporter although not as potently as SERT. This effect is similar to Qelbree, which is SNRI. I found an interesting article ""Norepinephrine-deficient mice lack responses to antidepressant drugs, including SSRIs."" The researchers found that ALL SSRIs except Lexapro need norepinephrine for their action. That includes Zoloft too. It appears the culprit of intrusive thoughts and increasing anxiety in my son is increase in norepinephrine. But on the other hand, it helps his calmness, cognition, speech and deeper thoughts. I am stuck. I like everything about Zoloft except it turns my son into a stressed teenager preoccupied with his intrusive racing thoughts and unable to focus. Has anyone been in this situation and found a solution to anxiety due to high NE levels?"
