193dyzk,Depression,2024-01-10,I’m a tired mom,"What’s new, right? I’m exhausted and I feel like I can’t do this anymore. I don’t know how many times I’ve told my husband that I need professional mental health and he doesn’t do anything. He sees me crying all the time. I told him I’m going to find a “cry for help”. I said “I don’t want to be here anymore”. He says he wants to help me. I just want to be put in an inpatient facility so I can have a break."
193dx4s,Depression,2024-01-10,Doing better but the demons always return,"Last year was the best and worst year of my life. I grew more than ever before after going through a relapse that ended up in my arrest, a divorce and truly turned my life upside down. Despite that, I’ve gotten better mentally than ever before. I’m happier than I’ve ever been, and am optimistic about the future…. Most days. 

Then there’s days like today where I wake up and it feels like there’s a knife in my heart, chest and throat. I’m lonely and don’t see any point of moving forward, because of the demons telling me I’m worthless, I’m hopeless and am just going to screw up again. I know it’s not true — or so I hope — but man, today is rough."
193dvxk,Depression,2024-01-10,How to deal with Weed and trying to understand its pros/cons,"I have been dealing with depression for a while now, and unlike alcohol I have always craved weed in my life. I am sure others of you have a similar experience, but it gives me a sense of purpose and ""life,"" that I don't feel day to day. Right now, I don't know if I should dive into smoking (maybe once a week) or quit entirely. I am fearful for the effects of de-personalization, and feeling even more dull in my day to day life. However, I am able to experience life so much more vividly which then does give a bigger purpose to me. I am sure you guys relate to this ordeal, and the effects of marijuana and I would love to hear how you deal with the cravings. "
193du0s,Depression,2024-01-10,I want to kill God.,"I just turned 30 a couple of weeks ago and I absolutely despise the reality he's damned us to.  I utterly loathe working.  I've been a cna for the last decade and I'm fucking done with it.  It's all I know how to do though.  I don't want to be a nurse because most nurses I know are fucking miserable.  I just want to stay in my fantasy world.  I just want to do my art, watch movies, play video games etc.   This world will never be as beautiful as the fantasy worlds of video games/anime or film.  I hate wearing a uniform and being on a time clock taking orders from someone else.  I don't want to die in a work uniform.  My house burnt down a year ago.  It destroyed THOUSANDS of dollars worth of action figures and merch.  A lot of custom figures I done myself were destroyed and are almost irreplaceable.  I wake up everyday with a seething anger in my heart.  I hate God so immensely I would kill him if given the chance.  My aunt was a devoted Christian and was an absolutely amazing person who would give you the shirt off her back.  She had to hate or wrath in her heart for anyone and that objectively make her a better person than the God she prayed to.  Yet he gave her lupus, diabetes and various other illnesses just to make sure she was always suffering to some extent.   I absolutely despise reality and I want to slaughter its creator.  He took everything I busted my ass for and I already hate working.  I hate the concept of getting up and going to some place I don't want to be doing shit I don't want to do.  God is a wreched beast and should be slain for his sins against humanity."
193dpw8,Depression,2024-01-10,How to get out of bed?,"The last few weeks I’ve been isolating.

193d5l3,Depression,2024-01-10,Welp. I've excercised- still depressed,"""Even small doses of excercise can help fight depression"" they say.

Well I've been exercising for 2 years now. I've gained 3st and am now a healthy weight. I go for walks (tho I did this before anyway) I lift weights, I sleep, I eat less sugar. I have VISIBLE muscles now.

Guess what? I'm still depressed and fatigued. 

Now I'm depressed and I need EXTRA naps to overcome my gym fatigue. I'm still depressed I just eat more eggs and force down protein I don't even want. 

I hate this. Why is there literally no reward. Why do I bother doing anything when I know that nothing changes."

193ctw7,Depression,2024-01-10,Am I depressed?,"I've been going through some stuff lately (as a student). I lost my only friends last year and now I only talk to a person or two every day. The loneliness affected me a lot, because up until last year, I had a support system at school, I had teachers I could entirely depend upon. I chaged schools. Now I've been this useless machine, who keeps replaying what's not there anymore.

Been a brilliant student all my life, but now I'm stooping so low where I know nothing a day before a scholarship test. I can't recognize myself in photos, in the mirror. It's as if the loneliness is taking the better of me... I cant believe the thoughts in my head actually belong to a body who's looking back at me in the mirror. When I'm at school and such, I have this weird feeling that I'm the CCTV camera at the edge of the walls, looking at kids studying with actual zeal. As if I'm not real.

And everything's gone haywire, I'm not doing none of the things I'm supposed to do as a good student. I'm overweight, I'm a disappointment, I don't have anyone to talk to. My problems seem so petty, which is why I've never gathered the courage to say them out loud. I'm probably catastrophizing, but can't seem to stop.

Can someone help? I don't want this to turn into depression, which Im so scared it'll eventually turn into. Or is it just a phase of me being sad?

Sorry for the rant."
193ched,Depression,2024-01-10,Is there any hope for a relationship when one partner is going through depression and becomes completely detached/isolated from the relationship as a result? Is it salveagable?,"As the title says. My girlfriend who has otherwise always been an upbeat, warm and caring partner has suddenly withdrawn and may be depressed. She is going through a difficult time in her family (dealing with a parent who has a potentially terminal illness) and it has hit her hard. She has become distant and detached as a result. 

She has confided in me the details of everything she is struggling with, saying that she can't focus, doesn't feel motivated to work, is sleeping more, her room is a mess, she is forgetting things, will have random spells of crying during the day, and feels like she is going through the motions.

As a result, she has become severely and uncharacteristicly detached from me. She told me she needs some space and we haven't spoken for a week. It's hard for me to not take it personally, because truthfully I genuinely don't fully understand what she is going through and why this is happening. For people who have been in these kind of situations before, is there any reason for hope that our relationship can survive this period?

193cbee,Depression,2024-01-10,Dealing with intrusive depressive thoughts,"Having developed depression recently, I’m struggling to navigate this mess. I’ve dealt with poor appetite and lost weight to it, am experiencing some hair loss, and I haven’t been out the house as much as unless I need to.

I’ve feared depression heavily prior to getting it, and now that I have it, I can’t help but ruminate on it all. I’ve dealt with intense and extreme intrusive thoughts, and felt ways that I never thought I would ever feel.

The feelings of being stuck, feeling hopeless, feeling like the weight of the world is too heavy, is truly a disgusting feeling.

However, stressing out over this has caused me a lot of negative physical changes, and I need to manage that better somehow.

My goal is figuring out how to deal with these waves and intrusive feelings and thinking. I seen a lot of people say they get comfort from thoughts of wanting to die whereas I get really anxious and stressed out.

I wish I had greater insight to tackle this shit, because I can’t keep feeling this way and let it break me down. I know that it’s like 2 sides to one coin, where one moment I feel optimistic and able to take on a task, and the next moment later, I feel as I’m I’m about to collapse.

There are times where I feel those feelings to truly be irrelevant, but they don’t feel that way when I feel them.

How do I feel them to be irrelevant always? This makes no sense to me"

193bxrr,Depression,2024-01-10,I've been defeated. Life won.,"I don't know what to do. I don't have any idea how to keep going. I feel like I was only born to lose and be miserable. For most of my life I haven't had any real friends. And when I finally did I ruined it and lost them. They meant everything to me and they were the only reason I cared about my future. I feel so numb and everything I loved means nothing now.

I've been told that sometimes we need to hit rock bottom to grow but it feels like everyday is a new rock bottom. They were supposed to be in my future. They are why I wanted to go to college and get a good job. They are why I wanted to live. I wasn't supposed to make it to 18. I was supposed to kill myself before I turned 18 but I chose to live because of them. I've tried to think of the future. I've tried to find the hope of a good life but I can't. I'm trans and my family is against that so I had planed to cut them off when I went to college. The thing is that I want a family. I care about my brother and I don't want to lose him but he would never accept me. So I either come out and lose my brother or I keep my brother and live a miserable lie.

 I have no motivation anymore. I can't do school work or care about my job. All I do is watch youtube or play video games but even that doesn't bring joy or escape. I don't want to be awake or asleep. I hate dreams because they shoe you a life you could have had then you wake up and it's all gone. I don't want to live or die. I just wish I didn't exist. Evergtime I struggled I found comfort in my dogs. When they died I thought it was all over but I found a way forward through my friends. But know I lost them and there is nothing else. I feel like I've actually lost everything. I've always tried to be a good person but I'm not. I've only ever hurt those I care about and I'm selfish. I hate myself. 

I wish I could kill myself. I have letters and a plan but I can never do it. I'm too weak and I hate that. There is nothing left for me. My whole life feels like regret after regret. And I don't want to regret the last thing I do. I don't know what to do. I can't live but I can't die. I'm really tired of being sad and angry and alone. I don't know how people can love life. I can barley do another week let alone several more years. I've always had a plan. Something that kept me moving forward but now I don't. I just don't know what to do."
193bsvf,Depression,2024-01-10,I’m tired and I don’t know what to do,"I (18F) came out to my parents 6 months ago about me liking girls and that I am currently in a relationship with one. It’d be an understatement to say that these 6 months have been pure hell for me. My parents are very conservative Christians and believe their beliefs are the “absolute truth” as my mother and father would tell me in their countless lectures to me about how I’m simply being “misguided by the devil” and that the life I have chosen will “lead to destruction”. They’ve bombarded me with threats of kicking me out of the home (this was when I was 17 and still a minor) and they refused to pay for my college tuition (after some talking they agreed to pay for it, but I have to pay them all of the money back later because I have hardly enough money to pay for a couple semesters). 

With all this stress and the constant arguments with my parents at home, I usually run away to my girlfriend’s house, only returning to my own house to sleep at—lest I get kicked out of the house. And I feel like this has created a bigger distance between me and my family. But honestly, I feel like it’d be better for me to move out, but I have no funds and I’m thinking about taking out a loan to dorm at my college, but for some reason I have been very hesitant about it. I’m not sure if it’s the right decision, and I don’t even know if I’ll stay in college. With the way I am right now, struggling to complete my school work and finding the motivation to show up to classes, I feel like I might be wasting my money. I am working a part time job but it’s difficult for me to balance school and work already with my declining mental health. The money I make from my job is hardly enough to cover a semester of college after about 5 months of working.

This situation I’m in has been taking a really bad toll on my mental health. I’m having breakdowns nearly everyday and my girlfriend really tries her best to be there for me, but lately she’s been having to sacrifice a lot of things for me and I can tell it’s taking a toll on her too. I knew what I would be dealing with by coming out to my parents, but I suppose I was too foolish and naive to think I could handle it when in reality, I really can’t. And now I’m breaking down because of it. I’m currently doing therapy at my school, but I just started and my next appointment is in a week so I haven’t really progressed much with my therapist yet. Some days I feel like ending it all would be better, but obviously I know it’s not the answer. Perhaps it’d rid myself of all of my problems and suffering, but it’d create more pain for others and I don’t want that.

I’m just really tired of all of this pain, but I don’t want to give up on my relationship and neither does my girlfriend. I really want to change and break away from my family, but I’m struggling to and I don’t know if it’s because I’m so attached to them. Before I came out, my family and I used to be a really loving family who spent time together all the time and to have that all vanish and have my entire family turn their backs on me… maybe I’m  still in shock. I can’t accept the fact that my family will never love me the same way again so long as I choose to love a girl. Because of this flaw of mine, I’m unable to do anything. I’m unable to change and become the person I want to be. And I’m extremely frustrated with myself for being this way. My girlfriend told me she’ll wait as long as she has to for me to get better. But I’m just really stuck. I can’t envision a future anymore. Whenever I think about it, I can’t see anything. Every time I try to change, I’m just met with more pain and regret. I just want to give up. But I don’t want to either. I truly want to live a life that I’m proud of and to show my family that I’m happy with who I am despite what they think. I just don’t really know how to get there and right now I’m feeling pretty hopeless."
193bird,Depression,2024-01-10,I want to isolate myself from everyone I know,"I go to a very competitive and rigorous boarding school, and all my friends are super smart except for me. I feel so stupid every single day and I want to isolate myself from them because they're all such incredible people and I feel unremarkable next to them. I'm socially awkward, not as smart as them, and not as funny. I do envy them but I would never want them to feel bad (because they are all very kind), so I obviously keep everything to myself. I don't understand what they see in me. They even threw me a surprise birthday party and I don't understand why they'd possibly want to do that. I just feel alone all the time and like I'm always on a treadmill, trying to do the next big thing, but I'm never enough, I feel so tired all the time but I have no real reason to.

193baqs,Depression,2024-01-10,I need some advice.,"I’m sorry, I don’t post much and certainly not about my mental health but I’m in need of some advice. 

So I’ve been depressed since I was in my teens and I’m now in my early 30s. I was diagnosed with Dysthymia (PDD) about five years ago. It sucks, but I live with it. 

Since just before Christmas though, something has shifted. I’m struggling to find the little bit of hope I had. Im very worried that in addition my dysthymia, I might be fighting MDD as well, something google informs me is known as “double depression”. My only real doubt of this is I’m not actively planning anything final. I’m not really shying away from the possibility but yeah. 

My questions are as follows: could it still be MDD even though I’m still functioning, albeit struggling?
And how does one begin to navigate this in the US without complete financial ruin? I make decent money but my insurance at my relatively new job (just &lt;1 year) is so bad that I had to stop seeing my psychiatrist and taking my meds. I just couldn’t afford it. My partner got laid off in early COVID and didn’t find a job for nearly two years and now makes about half what they did before. All of the bills have been on me for a few years. I have $3 in my bank account. I can’t stop working but I’m also feeling like my entire reason for living is financial responsibility. 

Sorry if none of this makes any sense, I’m just having a really hard time."

193apko,Depression,2024-01-10,Wondering how adding stimulants can help with procrastination (chronic depression/anxiety),"Background: I've had GAD since I was a child, and my first episode of clinical depression in high school. (I'm middle-aged now.) I have taken anti-depressants off and on over the years, but have only just realized that I never got increased to a ""therapeutic dose."" One side effect of my depression and anxiety (and, tbh, past trauma) is procrastination. 

I stopped taking my antidepressant this summer for about three months as I wasn't feeling like it was doing anything and I was tired of taking pills. I didn't feel depressed and was not in a clinically depressed episode. After 3 months, I realized that I wasn't ""ok"" - not depressed but really feeling overwhelmed - and resumed taking my previous dose. After talking to my therapist, she recommended talking to my doctor about increasing my dose. Before doing that, I also talked to some pharmacists I know who specialize in psych and pharmacogenomics and then took their recommendations to my GP. GP was in agreement with the recommendations (titrate up to double the antidepressant dose and consider a low dose of stimulant if that's not enough).

I'm doing well on the increased dose of antidepressant - not feeling as overwhelmed and have actually been doing some crafting instead of doomscrolling. However, I am still really struggling with procrastination. Is this something that a small dose of a stimulant (Abilify) would help with? I do not have ADHD, but do relate to it. I haven't been on the increased dose for 6 weeks yet, and certainly want to give that time to see what its greatest impact will be before making any additional changes, but I wanted to get feedback on how adding a low dose stimulant might help and maybe some personal experiences."

I don’t tell him any of this, I just my depression is worse, I have sick leave from work and I have absolutely no idea how to be a good partner cause I don’t even know how to look after myself. Maybe it’s my abandonment issues dreading him leaving me, maybe I’m jealous (I definitely am) that he has friends and I have absolutely none.

I know you guys aren’t therapists, I just needed to express this, I told my doctor that everything is getting worse and I’ve started lashing out on my boyfriend when I can’t control my anger and he reassured me and said he knows I’m a good person.

193a73i,Depression,2024-01-10,I've been suicidal since the last year .,"I 20(f) , will turn 21 soon and I've been in depression since the last 2 years and suicidal since about 9 or 10 months now . 
It all started when I failed my university exam by 4-5 marks or so last year and despite numerous requests to be ""PASSED"" as an exception , was denied and told to repeat the whole year again . 
I've  been doubting my abilities and the entire point of my life since then , I've asked my parents to seek psychiatric help  for me (as I'm still living under their roof, and under their care ) . Last month counts the 7th time of me asking  them to do something about my mental wellbeing and everytime I've  been ignored or denied immediately on the spot . I don't  feel my home is my safe space anymore. I feel like  all of my life has gone downhill , my mental health has been decreasing day by day and I can't  seem to get myself back up on my feet. I've been having this feeling of un-alive-ing myself since a long time but I'm  too scared to act on it , it seems like I care about my family too much that I can't hurt them like this but they don't  seem to give a shit about what I going on with me . 
Idk honestly what is going to happen , all the talent I had , I've  lost and I'm  not able to find it back again .
It feels like I'm screaming on top of my voice in a room full of people but all they can hear is a whisper, ig they're not able to hear that too . I could have gone to therapy myself but I don't  have any money on me and I don't  want to lie about where the money I take from my parents is going ."
193a5mo,Depression,2024-01-10,Is this possible with depression?,"I’ve had depression for over 20 years on and off and at different levels. The recent one has been very bad and I’ve had it a month now. It started by extreme rumination and anxiety triggered after getting a bad flu which severely lowered my mood. 

I confided in the doctor some personal things from a long time ago , he reassured me but I’ve felt slightly paranoid since as it leaves you feeling vulnerable 

It’s irrational, but I feel a bit paranoid when out in public, I feel extremely serious with a lack of humour and my sleep is poor, in spite of doing excercise, and even though I feel shattered my brain isn’t switching off and I’m awake 

Can depression make you feel a bit paranoid and fearful?  I’ve never been paranoid, it’s more of an uneasy feeling when In public at least . Have you experienced it too and how did it manifest for you?"

1939rb7,Depression,2024-01-10,Drowning,"I, F28, was diagnosed with depression since Oct 2022. I was on Sertraline for 6 months, now i have stopped taking it as i was doing better and managing my symptoms well. My depression was mainly fuelled by burnout as a someone in healthcare myself. 6 months ago, i quit my full time job and am now working part time, aside from trying to sit for exams that would allow me to work in another country with better work-life balance. For the most part I have been doing so much better, and take good care of myself. However, i will admit there are extremely low mood days, and I have been struggling for the past month, since mid december. Mostly it feels like im having an existential crisis almost everyday, withdrawn, crying spells, and pure lack of motivation to prep for my upcoming exam. The brain fog is so thick and my mind is just scattered. I am still able to focus while i'm at work, but it just feels like i'm constantly at war with myself. I am in therapy but i just feel like i'm constantly drowning and reaching for air, but somehow I'm not able to surface and keep getting pulled down."
1939r3p,Depression,2024-01-10,Need advice,I've been so depressed that I've been skipping school and going to work is such a hassle. How do I stop doing this? Does anyone have any tips that have helped them?
1939ite,Depression,2024-01-10,I think my depression has ruined my relationship and I feel like a failure.,"I (40F) have been dating my boyfriend (45M) for 7 years, living together for 2 1/2 years but I spent most of the time at his place throughout the years. I have always been depressed during this time, sometimes it was better but it was always THERE. Things have been generally good but we have had quite a few rough patches and both of us have done things during those times that we're not proud of. We have tried couples counseling a few times but it did not go well and neither of us felt like it helped. Over the weekend, we probably had the most intimate and productive conversation we have had in a long time. We both agreed that we did not need to be together but neither of us are willing to fully pull that trigger at this time. We discussed what we needed from each other for our relationship to have even a smidgen of a chance. His needs focused on my depression and how it has become exhausting for him (which I completely understand). What he needs from me is what I've always wanted for myself so it is not a ""change for me"" type of situation.

I have significant but mostly functional depression and CPTSD. I have always been able to work a full time professional job but have been fired once due to my depression symptoms. My depression usually manifests into impulsive rage fits that end with me crying to the point of a panic attack and/or no motivation to do anything, including work, eating, things with friends/bf, etc. I have become so insecure/anxious and have no confidence. I have lost friends due to my symptoms. I had a traumatic childhood and was really good at masking symptoms for a long time. I think as I've gotten older-I just can't mask anymore, even to myself. 

I am in therapy once a week and do EMDR, take medication although I don't really know if it's doing anything but tbh I'm not sure any of it ever has, and have an appt. to see a psychiatrist in February. I have a gym membership and have spoken to a personal trainer but have not actually made the move to go to the gym. Currently I have two good friends and one of them lives 4 hours away and the other one, I'm worried if I go to her with every little thing she will soon tire of my shit. I have no SI (although there has been some in the past which he has been party too)-I'm just really sad and insecure. 

Saying all of this, I know my relationship will probably end. It ending will also open up a whole new set of problems related to moving that I will be anxious about. I feel like my depression and how I have let it take over my life has reduced me to this shell of a person. Even with us talking about everything this weekend, I still can not help but dissect everything he says and does-or doesn't do and I hate it. I don't know how to live in the present and appreciate things for what they are. I know I need more human contact but making friends in your late 30's, early 40's when you don't have kids is insanely hard. I'm not sure what my intention was in writing this post, maybe just support and knowing I'm not the only one that's been a complete shit to someone that loves them and it turned okay. "

19392bi,Depression,2024-01-10,I’m fighting it,"I know I’m depressed right now. I just tuned 34m on Sunday the 7th. The holidays then new years then my birthday usually doesn’t effect me too much either way but this year I keep finding myself deflecting serious negative thoughts. I’ve had it pretty tough so far considering both my parents died one month apart from each other back in 2017. They weren’t the best parents I’ll just say that. I’ve struggled with substance abuse and survived opiate addiction and have been sober for 4 years. I don’t feel happy. I know I’ve gotta be bipolar a little atleast   I just keep fighting the most terrible suicidal ideations. I won’t ever kill myself. All life’s problems can be fixed. That’s a permanent mistake. A lot of my friends and family have committed suicide and I know it just hurts everyone else. So I have to live. I lost my job in November Ive invested a lot of time into one trade and im good at it so job searching is going well although being off work for 2.5 months. I had some money put up and my girlfriend works so it’s not even money that’s making me feel like this. 

I feel like I have to exert so much effort right now just to BE. Getting dressed, eating, moving, chores, watching tv, nothing really brings me joy. It’s almost like I won’t let it. I feel useless when I’m not working. Since I know I don’t want to just die and give up it’s like I have to start from step 1. It hurts to look around me and see how successful everyone is. But I don’t wanna die. It feels like my first day out of hs all over again. What do I do with my life? I have no kids. I don’t really own anything anymore. I don’t even know what I love really. I want to love myself but idk if I can. I don’t wanna die but I don’t really know how to live. I guess I just expected I wouldn’t have lived passed 30. This is really hard."
1938xbz,Depression,2024-01-10,I don't enjoy things anymore but I don't want to stress anyone out further,"I have been getting help for my ed which has stripped me of all happiness, but I might be lying to myself when I say ""help"" because my own brain doesn't want me to get better. I'm still a student so my ed has forced me to miss a substantial amount of time in school and I constantly feel guilty that my mum has to argue my case to them. Don't get me wrong the school puts massive importance on mental health but attendance always stays the priority. I've always been academic, even while my ed was developing, but lately the thought of staying there makes it feel like this is all my life is ever going to amount to be. I'm afraid that all my mental health concerns will stunt my learning, and that I'll never be able to live a life outside of school, just going in, studying and going back home to sleep. What makes it worse is that I surround myself with incredibly toxic people. They call themselves my friends but they message each other about me, not even caring that I can see. The reason why I haven't stopped talking to them I think is because I'm so desperately trying to cling on to the feeling of being happy and social and enjoying my teenage years. They invite me to hang out so that they can boast their big friend group on social media, even though we all mutually dislike each other. I first started noticing my feelings of emptiness when I was in the depths of my ed and I would never feel joy while talking to anyone while I was out, like an out of body experience. 

I've been waiting for a vacation for a few years now. I spent all the days leading up to it only thinking about how excited I was, because of that each day seemed long and meaningless. When it finally got to the day of when I was leaving to go on a vacation, I was so confused and mad at myself for not being in higher spirits. Now I'm in my hometown visiting family, but I don't have the energy to talk to them or go out for plans that I thought I was so excited for a few months ago. My ed has stemmed or morphed into new territory to the point where I'm not even sure what it's classified as. It was my mum's birthday yesterday and I tried my best to enjoy it but I coudn't even find the energy to get dressed up like I usually do for parties. My mum takes a whole new approach when it comes to helping my ""recover"". I think that she expects guilt to have an effect on me, constantly screaming at me that I'm breaking the family apart by never being present and wanting to stay in bed the whole day. I can't even remember what life felt like when I wanted to go out and enjoy myself. When will I  What happens when all this is over and I go back home to my usual cycle, do I admit myself to a mental institution ( I didn't previously mention this but my physical state is incredibly poor and I've been threatened of being put into a ward)?

1938jhb,Depression,2024-01-10,Depressed partner advice,"I (33f) and my husband (31m) have been having problems off and on since our first child suddenly and unexpectedly passed away right after her birth. This was in March of 2021. He has struggled with depressive episodes even before that though, just not nearly as common as it is now. 
We had our second child, our son, about a year ago. My husband has been having some problems at his job this year which he attributes to mostly causing his current and worst depressive episode. 
I thought our relationship was doing better lately but last night we had a conversation where he said that he doesn’t know if he’s cut out to be a husband and father and it’s too much. He said he’s not getting anything out of it. He was even talking about divorce and separation.
I guess I just want to know if a very depressed person is telling you they want to cut you out of their life, do you take them at their word? Or once he starts feeling better (he did just start a new medication) do you think he will change his mind? I don’t want to go through the process of divorce if it’s mostly his depression talking. I just don’t know how to know."

I don't want to do homework, i dont want to hit the gym like i used to, all i want is to stare at the ceiling 24/7. My classmates don't like me all that much, I only really talk to one person, and he doesn't care much either. No one ever texts me, no one ever asks me how i am, except for maybe my parents, but even then ive grown so distant and now i barely talk to them. The moment I get home i just try to lose myself in computer games or YouTube videos and it even helps sometimes, but i still feel that feeling in the back of my mind if you know what i mean. Sometimes Im actually better for a few days, then it comes back. Everything is so exhausting. When i try to recall my day i feel like someone slapped a yellowish filter on my memories. Going through the day knowing that no one's there to cheer you up when you're down, no ones there to give you a helping hand, it hurts. Especially when i see others do that for each other. Sometimes i think I've been like that most of my life. Lately it's gotten worse. Now im about to sleep, then wake up, then commute, then sit in school for 8 hours, alone and sad. Repeat for 4 months.

Before I could easily distract myself from my depression for some time during the day.Now it’s impossible to the point where I often have mental breakdowns about waking up tomorrow again before sleep.
I’m totally losing it.I became super sensitive towards everything that has to do with society even tho I don’t participate much in it.Lots of stuff that I could not be so effected before triggers me tremendously.

I just see the world as a very bad place therefore that keeps me isolated.Ofc I have moments of gratitude and love towards the world but all that’s negative overpowers it so much that I don’t know how to not pay attention to that and pretend everything is okay.

I'm not sad, or IDK. It's just that I feel so down, sad, unmotivated feeling lonely. I don't talk about it cause I know there's no one I know who will probably understand me also because I tend to overshare things that makes no sense, I'm really bad at speaking my mind.

My close friends are busy people, and I know they're all dealing with their own shits. And none of them could really understand me, I know, because I've always been their support system.

I'm jobless at the moment, nothing to get busy with. This usually happens after a night out. It's like a really bad hangover but instead of headaches I get really depressed.

19386vq,Depression,2024-01-10,I did something stupid,"1 week ago I was going out with 2 friends, and my father saw me driving a friend's car, he got pissed and told the guards of the gated cominuty to block that car from entering it ever again.
When that happened I felt guilt for my friend and anger for my dad, so I cut my wrist and when my father saw I SH, he instead of trying to calm me only got angrier and started yelling at me.
That made me freak out even more so I SH in front of him, I cut deep like I never did before, I left several small poddles of blood on the floor and my mom drived me to the hospital, I got seven stitches and 2 days later the same friend was abble to get in with his car, with no issue whatsoever, then I realized I did all of this for no reason."

Around 19-20 I was able to catch my strive and was able to land a job at a fast food place, which enabled me and my fiancé to move out of my grandmas house, which  was insanely cramped because it was 5 of us in a 2 people house. That’s I think when my depression worsened. Had I gotten a job and was able to keep my fiancé,my mom and I, and at our old house I truly think so much of life could be different but who cares the past is the past. Once we moved our we were I think the happiest we’ve ever been as a couple, end that says a lot since we met at 13-15 online ten years ago on Gaia online. I stuck with the fast food job, until an incident occurred that made me search elsewhere, which led me working for a gigantic retail chain. From March of 2019-  September 2019 , though short I was able to increase the stores revenue.l I was fired in summer and a friend helped me get on at a movie chain. Within six months I was a server there. Making insane Money. A friend that worked there passed, and I became bitter.. to be continued when I am less tired I am about to pass out"
1937vxr,Depression,2024-01-10,Do I have depression? I'm emotionless,"I started to have lack of emotions when I was a kid. I was in three relationships, but it was a bad experience, I was manipulated for money, I pushed them away, I didn't know how to take care of them, and I even abused them. My energy has been extremely drained due to school, getting 4 to 5 hours of sleep a day, having to do my homework which takes me like 4 hours to finish because I have bad grades. I used to be a bully, and didn't treat my friends like ""friends"". Some of my friends even manipulated me for the things they want, they were toxic as well. Till to this day, I am a bad person, I'm a person with shit personality, and when someone complains about it, I deserve it. I used to whine a lot which made me a pathetic crybaby.  
  
I became emotionless it's because I want to camouflage my weakness, I wanted to stop crying, I just had enough. Now my eyes are like 60% open, and I rarely (not a lot, but sometimes) smile. Now everyone around me is afraid of me because of my face, they think it's scary or something. Some of them even asked if I was depressed.  
  
I made some posts about this on other subreddits. Some people were telling me it's because of depression, but I don't feel any sadness inside of me.

1937uuj,Depression,2024-01-10,Isolation Is My Life,"People often wonder why im so quiet. Truth of the matter is, I'm afraid. Afraid I'll say the wrong thing. Afraid people won't like the real me. I'm a coward, and I have very little to show for my life. I wish I could be stronger, just not give a flying fuck, but the fear I feel is so debilitating, i'd rather just quit trying to fix my problem altogether. It just snowballs.

I've not maintained even one tie with anyone from high school. I've had friends before, but I've always let the fear of judgement, or seeming 'abnormal', from the 'normal' push me away from them. Or, maybe I felt above them in some way. Don't really know, or care anymore. All I know is that, whatever I am, I'm utterly pathetic.

However, I'd like to think I'm a compassionate person and feel genuine remorse for my inconsiderate actions, whether it was through my ignorance or just not caring. I want to be better, but I'm always... still me, at the end of the day. 

I'd have offed myself long ago if I knew it wouldn't hurt anyone too close in my life. Life, quite frankly, doesn't seem to be worth my time. Yet I drag myself to work in a shop every day. I tell myself I do it all for my brother, the person i love in life the most, to give him the best possible shot at life. But even he doesn't seem to understand that. I work with him. He's told me before, all the other guys think I don't like them because of my introverted nature.

I'll probably die relatively young from years of mistreating my body through improper diet and inactivity. Even though I'm not currently suicidal, I still get the thought every now and then. I just wish I could love myself, make my stay here somehow slightly less miserable. But with each passing day, month, and year, that seems less and less likely. It took a lot of courage to make this post because I feel like maybe I don't deserve to suffer anymore. Maybe I'm not such a piece of shit. Maybe I deserve better. Then again, maybe not. I'm just lost.

1937ozq,Depression,2024-01-10,I want to restart my life,"
I’m 21 M from the UK and have nothing going for me. When I finished school my parents moved us away from the place I grew up, completely separating me from everything I knew. For the first year I tried to keep all of my connections in contact but after a while I started to notice that all of my friends were going down a path I did not want to follow. So now I have no one in my life that I can relate too or have a connection with, I’ve never really had similar interests with anyone in my family and now I just feel like I’m forcing myself to like stuff so I don’t feel alone. Im just so miserable all the time with no purpose and I just feel like I don’t fit in anywhere I go. I’ve been working since I left school, so I have met a lot of new people but I just don’t connect with anyone!! I just feel like I need to restart my life somewhere knew but I have no idea on how to do it, I don’t want to discuss it with my family because I know they won’t understand and perhaps unknowingly judge me idk. I’ve always thought about moving to Australia and starting fresh, but I have absolutely no idea on how to do so. I also just don’t know what it is that I want to do with my life, a wise man once said “An aim is the only true treasure you can find in life” but I am massively struggling to find that. I just feel disconnected from everything and idk what to do, I don’t even know why I’m doing this tbh, hopefully to find answers to my pointless existence. Hopefully this all makes sense lol"

Like the anger is a phantom pain when every other part of me is numb. Sometimes when I realize I feel like that I try to bring that anger to the forefront, because it never feels like I'm truly, genuinely feeling anything, but it falls flat, and the numb part becomes to feel almost louder.  


It doesn't happen every single time, but it's become enough of a usual occurrence that I feel like it would be good to ask for any insight anyone has on this kind of thing."
1937g4y,Depression,2024-01-10,Chronically secondary in the lives of all the people I cherish the most,"Has anyone ever had this curse? Ever since I was born, I was never anyone's primary friend or most important person. In school, my 'best friends' would always consider me just a normal friend or even an acquaintance at times; just someone nonoffensive to fill a space at a lunch table or talk to in a class with nobody else sitting near them. I wouldn't be invited to anything, be that some kind of party or event or anything, nor would I be prioritized in any respect when I wanted to do something. 

Now in my adult life, the same patterns pop up again and again. My best friends probably consider me an important person but certainly not a priority. One only sees me as an available person to play games with, and is currently ignoring all my messages as he plays with people who explicitly rejected me. Another has such an involved and vibrant social life that I am rapidly degenerating to the point of the hangers-on; our commonalities of mental illness and loneliness have rapidly been erased as they establish relationships, stable friendships, heal mentally, while I continue to rot and my personality continues to be the loser who wants to die; a buzzkill who ruins the mood. And how could I hate someone genuinely improving their life? Yet, it still hurts.

In both of these cases I would say that these are my best friends and irreplaceable social links, yet their lives would presumably be unchanged if I announced I was getting on a train to Albuquerque and living off-grid for the rest of my life. And also just like school, I'm forced to lie to my parents about how valued I am in order to deceive them into the belief that I'm socially well-adjusted. Hell, my mom is one of my best friends and I sometimes talk to her more than anyone else; yet she sent me a glitter bomb for Christmas and simply found it funny while I silently broke down on the other end.

The curse of being a secondary person to your most important people is the fact that it hurts, but it is also impossible to stop. You will always fear the potential pain of loneliness more than the real pain of whatever the hell you call this present social existence. Humans need connection no matter how painful or saddening, thus for the rest of my life I will presumably be stuck as the least important important person in the lives of my friends."

my depression has gotten worse since college winter break. tbh my first semester i wasn’t so depressed in fact i was way happier tbh with some depressive episodes here and there, as i wasn’t home with my mother and near my dad as being around them makes me even more depressed. me having undiagnosed adhd makes it even worse since it makes me feel like something is just wrong with me. i’ve also been feeling really avoidant and i barely have any energy. my room at home is a mess and all i do is play video games (spider-man 2 currently lol) and scroll on my phone in bed. i never feel like making food/eating either it’s fucking infuriating. I already hate my weight and want to gain to where i originally was at but the lack of energy is making it impossible and i’m loosing way more weight which makes me insecure as fuck and  hate my body from time to time. 

Last time i showered and did my skincare rountine was a few days ago which makes me even more depressed too bc it makes me feel disgusting plus i feel a little better after i do shower + skincare  but it’s so hard to get up and have the energy to take one. my room is actually a hell hole. it’s not THAT bad but bad enough for me to be upset about it. i’ll clean it once then it’s immediately a mess the next day for a while :/. 

i just want to breakdown and cry. i don’t really enjoy texting my friends that much anymore other than like 1-2 of them and i fr just want to be left alone. also, i feel like sometimes being dead would be so much better but it’s something i wouldn’t do myself as i would be afraid too but if i got in a car accident or something and died that would be fine with me. this shit us just so hard and it’s just been getting worse bc i’m home. 

i’m thinking about going up to 50mg because i’ve been taking 25mg of zoloft for like 3+ months now and i think i’ll probably feel a slight improvement like i did when i first started taking zoloft if i go up a dose. this all just really sucks"

1936yvv,Depression,2024-01-10,I've been crying for several days almost non-stop and I'm so exhausted,"I have a great life, a loving partner, my relationship with parents is decent, I study at a prestigious university, but I'm always sad and I always feel like shit. I've had depression for a long time with its ups and downs, recently it got so much worse and now I can't stop crying even though everything is okay. Yesterday I was crying while commuting, today I had to sit through a class with tears streaming down my face. I went to a convenience store weeping. I don't know what to do, I have this very heavy and unpleasant feeling in my chest that doesn't go away. It's just like several years ago when I was at my worst, I also cried non-stop. Suicidal thoughts are coming back as well. I don't want to put my partner through this, they deserve more than a person who's perpetually sad. I'm venting here because I don't want them to know how bad I feel, there's only so much bullshit they can take from me before they leave me. This mental anguish is so unbearable, I have no idea how I'm gonna get through this week. Thank you for reading this, even if you aren't planning on replying, I just needed to let it out."
1936sjk,Depression,2024-01-10,Last night I attempted for the first time in about a year.,"For context, I'm a transgender boy in my teens. I'm on Zoloft for my depression. I've had it since 2020, but it went undiagnosed until last year. Recently I've had a lot of stress in my life (failing classes, broke up with my boyfriend, and drama)

I was especially upset about my boyfriend. He said he's not ready for a relationship. I still love him. I love him so much. We're still friends but he said he needs space. I'm bad at that because there's a huge likelihood that I have Borderline Personality Disorder (I have every symptom and grew up in a bad household, I'm working on getting a diagnosis). I have very severe attachment and abandonment issues.

But the reason behind the attempt last night was drama with someone. Long story short he made rape jokes about people in the friend group and said he pictured us naked. We dropped him last week due to that. He decided to snitch on us for shit that we didn't do and now we might get in trouble at school. 

Now that you have context, here's what happened. I'm prescribed 50mg of Zoloft per day. I'm fairly small (5'0 and around 100lbs) 200mg is considered overdose. I took 4 pills which is equal to 200mg. I wrote a suicide note in my notes app to the people I love. And I put on my priv story and in my dc server that I took 200mg and I love everyone and hope someday we meet again. Within 5 minutes my phone was blowing up, and within 10 my neighbor who's like a big sister to me was holding my hair back as I threw up the pills. She saved my life. Without her I most likely would have died. I'm so greatful for her."

1936d4i,Depression,2024-01-10,Scared of letting life pass me by (and other thoughts),"It's already 10 Jan 2024. But I shouldn't be surprised should I. Every day is the same. For the past year all I have done is wake up, stare at my phone and laptop and then go back to bed. Screen time literally takes up 50% of my life. Imagine that. Imagine 20 years going by and 10 years of it spent on my phone. I am so upset with myself. I am a fraction of who I used to be. People look down on me now and I can't seem to pick myself up. 

But apparently when you journal you have to be kind to yourself. I am having a tough time. It is expected that I would turn to cheap dopamine sources to compensate for my lack of happiness in general. I feel like I am paralysed.

How am I supposed to convince myself that I deserve better? Because isn't it hard to say who deserves more and who deserves less? Society has made it such that people who deserve happiness most are the ones who think they deserve happiness most. But there was once a philosopher I believe who once said something along the lines of "" You can't will what you will."" What if I am doomed to not want anything better for myself forever. I dont wanna be blackpilled for the rest of my life. How does one find the motivation for anything."

1935w8e,Depression,2024-01-10,Looking to share my story for the first time.,"Hello, I'm a 16 years old highschool student living in Ontario and  I'm experiencing depression.

During my Grade 9 year of highschool my mother passed away from a lung cancer and it hit me like a freight train. It came out of fucking no where. She went from being diagnosed with a ""pneumonia"" to hospice care and on her deathbed in two weeks.
After this situation it was just me, my younger brother (who is still in elementary school) and my father who are left in our household and the stress of having to manage the house and to parent my younger sibling is starting to make me crack. 

I used to have a large friend group in school who I would be the most sociable one in, I used to be such a charismatic person and happy person, I use to put effort into the things I did.  Now I don't even care about my personal interests, friends. My favorite hobby now is to be bedridden any chance I get and to rest most of the days I come back from school.

This is the first time I've ever shared this story because after my mom passed I put up walls around myself because I thought I needed space, but now I have drifted apart from friends so hard that there is no one that I'm comfortable to speak to. It has been around 2 years since she passed away and I thought I would have been over it by now but the pain and grieving I feel never stop. 

For those who are still reading this thank you so much for hearing out my story because I've had this bottled up for so long and no way to vent them out and no one to converse with.

People who have had similar experiences with me, could you give me advice on how you found you're way out?"
1935s65,Depression,2024-01-10,Suicidal thoughts,"I just failed another exam. It's my first year in university and I'm already failing all my main subjects. I've been on the edge the entire time and today my patience has ended and I want to kill myself. Not doing it because I'm not home alone, literally the only reason. Yesterday I was talking on a suicide hotline,  but I still felt terrible after. I have been told by many people to not be depressed, to pick myself up, to study hard and put effort but how can I do all this when I'm feeling so low. It's not as easy as that. I've had enough, this life isn't for me and I completely failed it. If you're curious, yes I prepare well for all my exams but on the last day or minute I panic and have mental breakdowns."
1935opw,Depression,2024-01-10,How can I help my friend who might have depression?,"My friend is 23(M). He is at a very low point in his life from 3 months. He is feeling very lethargic, has no energy to do anything, can't sleep, feeling hopeless persistently, wants an escape, is having suicidal thoughts, apathetic towards his well-being, guilty, feeling like he is a burden to everyone generally and also when he asks for help, has lost interest in daily activities, socially isolated, having racing thoughts. There might be more symptoms too. 
I am trying to help him in every way I can. I talk to him daily. Today, I checked-in, asked how he is feeling. He said that he just wants an escape. I asked him ""Take just one day at a time, does that help you?"" He denied. I gave him reasons to live. I listen to him without judgement. He feels better after talking to me, but it's just temporary. I can't be physically there with him all the time, although I want to be there. Nothing is really helping him. So I suggested him to seek professional help, he told me that his parents will not allow him to do so. I provided him resources to seek help, and said I'll pay for his treatment. 
But he has no energy to do anything, he is not pushing himself to do anything, which I understand. I don't want to come across like I'm forcing him. I don't want to put pressure on him. I don't want to lose him. How can I help him? I am usually just empathic while talking to him, but I don't give him much advices because I don't know what could help him. When someone is in depression, in my opinion, only professional help can be a solution, because depression is an illness. 
But he has no access to professional help. Please suggest me what can I say or do to help him. Also, he has informed his parents about some of his symptoms, like feeling sad or hopeless all the time. They commented that he is just being lazy. As a result, he felt more hesitant for opening up about suicidal thoughts."
1935o7l,Depression,2024-01-10,Why do I ruin everything,"Why do I ruin everything? I'm such a failure at life. When it comes to making a decision, I always make the wrong one. I try so hard but I hurt everyone. My brain doesn't work right and I can't fix it. I try to keep things to myself because I don't want to make people mad or frustrated with me. I let people take advantage of me because I can't tell the difference between someone genuinely being nice and someone being nice to get something. I'm an oddball. I'm a joke. I want to crawl in a hole and die."
1935i3y,Depression,2024-01-10,Feeling bad,"My sleep quality is bad. I don't fall asleep easily or for long. I'm tired all the time and I can get no relief.

I'm stressed to the max about my finances. What I'm doing isn't working and I don't know how to make this better.

I can barely function in my life. My home is becoming more and more of a disaster every day. I shower maybe once every three days and I barely brush my teeth anymore. I eat once a day. Not by choice but because I can't motivate myself to eat. 

I'm feeling trapped. I wake up everyday wishing I hadn't. I pray for something to just happen so that I wind up dead. 

I can't even express this to anyone in my life. I tried last night with a friend but I couldn't get the words out. He just got frustrated with me. 

I don't even think if I was to do something about this that it would make a difference. I've been living with this for a long time, many years. It gets better sometimes and then worse again. The bottoms seem to be getting lower. Medication doesn't help. Therapy doesn't help. 

I guess I'll keep going until I self-destruct. This is me.

She leads a normal social life, excels in her higher education, and is independent, while I've faced multiple failures during my first year of college.  
  
I feel very inferior, almost like a nobody. My struggles in maintaining relationships with others, coupled with my academic setbacks, intensify these feelings of inadequacy.

1934vfv,Depression,2024-01-10,I’m so tired,"I just wish something would kill me, give me a quick and relatively painless death. 

There is no hope in my life. Just sadness, depression, fear, burdens. Things just get worse, one way or another. I am just grudgingly trudging through one day and then the next,

It tortures me when I see people around me being happy (and yes, this makes me feel petty).  Sometimes it doesn’t take much to stir up my envy - just the fact that they have healthy family members who do not require their care, who do not cause them immense stress and anxiety. 

I never really had a life of my own.  Not even when I was a young person. There was always something (I still have difficulty divulging this - but to put it simply, I grew up with a disabled family member). Meanwhile, my needs were not really dealt with (asd, depression, anxiety, etc). I was ""normal"". My family needed me to be ""normal"".

Now that I am in the throes of mid-life, it horrifies me that I have fallen into the role of the spinster daughter. My mother is now 70, and sadly not as fit as one would have hoped (her own mother, my grandmother, was v fit at the same age). It’s a funny age - many are still fit as a fiddle (including my boss who is 74), but some suddenly age quickly. 

Growing up, my plan was to earn enough to look after my family. I thought I would be a career woman, who would be able to afford good care for my family, meanwhile not having to make huge compromises to my own personal life. That didn’t happen. I live with my mother, I sleep in my childhood bedroom. It frightens me and I am constantly in denial, but I fear that I would have no choice but to be a hands-on carer at some point.

Writing all of this makes me feel very selfish. I love my mother. Whilst she didn't help me with my mental health/asd, etc, I fully acknowledge that it was a different era, and she did what she considered the best she could do. She is a good and kind woman, despite the disappointment and suffering she faced in her life. But I can't help feeling sorry for myself, for how my life turned out. I have no friends, no spouse, no partner, no career to speak of - it seems that the only ""point"" of my existence on earth is to be here for my mother. No one else cares for me, likes me, or would miss me if I am gone."
1934n86,Depression,2024-01-10,I hate myself and my country,"I hate myself and my country

I live in a third world country going through a war and I don't see a future for myself anymore, I was struggling with uni and was planning to change my major until this war started and ruined everything for me, on top of that I don't see a future for my family either, I have a brother also going to the same uni as I do and this war has ruined everything for him as well, my mother desperately needs surgery and my father is working as a doctor, yes, but it simply doesn't pay enough and he's quite old by now, he should be on retirement, if only I hadn't messed everything many times in uni I would be working outside of this shitty country by now and bringing money to my family, I'm still in my first year despite being 22, I'm such a failure.

I sometimes dream about killing myself, about how everyone would react, would they grieve for me or would they be happy?

University one, first year. Already felt hopeless, pissed and suicidical during school days. When I found out I will have free ticket to study to university, I got some sort of light, something to achieve even tho, that being hopeless didn't left. 

Today it was my report discussion. All I hear is just negative, no footnotes, no ""full"" content. And that's it, that's all they have to say. I been interested in doing that, did projects and people like it, because it was simple for everyone.

Best part about this, when I left, other student work was being just positive, no details just positive in general and that was for like couple other students as well.

Now I guess I can go back to my old habits, start cutting myself again. Never thought that being a least a little positive in this short amount time can be ruined in couple minutes."
1933umr,Depression,2024-01-10,I fucking hate it,"I used to be okay. I could talk to people about how I felt, and I'd genuinely listen to them. But now, it's like I'm just going through the motions. I hate my job, and I can't seem to feel anything. There's no joy after a kiss from my girlfriend, no happiness in a simple walk. It's frustrating because I remember a time when I could feel things.

My house is a mess, and I can't muster up the energy to clean or eat healthy. I used to love cooking, but now it's all about ordering fast food. Today, going back to work only made me feel more empty. I'm just sitting in a corner, waiting for the day to be over, so I can go home, sit in the shower, and not think about anything.

You know what? I fucking hate it, to be forced to work to pay my fucking Bills, going to a job i hate, having no possibility of changing it for a while because of some problems i had, it makes me sink even deeper, all my fucking friends disappeared, i only have my girlfriend and my dog, and i love them very much, but sometimes even listening to my girlfriend is difficult.


Some days, I think about just getting a plane ticket and leaving without telling anyone. But then I feel guilty, wondering why I'd even consider it. I'm not sure where I belong in this world, or maybe I'm just not looking in the right place. 


I don't exactly know why I wrote this post, maybe just to talk and see if anyone is in the same boat as me"

2) Had stomach cramps and diarrhea the whole night. Couldn't sleep either. 

3) Had to take No Pay Leave from work as I was still on probation. 

4) Dented the carpark gantry when I accelerated too much while waiting for the barrier to lift for me.

Like this is the SHIT that I have to deal with on a daily basis. "
1932lfv,Depression,2024-01-10,I just don’t know what if I disconnect from myself,"Hi guys,

It’s hard for me to say or to describe myself right now.
All I can say is depression hit me really hard on September. Too much pressure I had to suffer on that period. Then one day, I feel… nothing.

I can’t have a feeling or emotion anymore. I think the old me is dead. I was really sensitive and subtle before and I could do anything instinctive. But then… no more.

And right now I think it’s too hard for me to tell you what I feel. What’s so wrong with me… I don’t know"
1932kpw,Depression,2024-01-10,i think im going crazy,"I feel empty headed on a daily basis, i struggle to have any original thought , kind of just like an empty vessel , my head feels clouded and it interferes with my daily life , i sometimes just dont know what to say in conversations, im in college and i have a hard time actively learning and retaining the information i learned. I tend to just zone out and it makes me feel like im losing myself , like im becoming a shadow of myself. I have no desire to connect myself to other people and the world around me. I feel like im in a shell and i just dont know what to do with myself anymore. Im just numb. I talked to my doctor and it looks like i have OCD and ADHD. I dont know how to combat this , i wish there was a reset button and all this could go away !"
1932jd4,Depression,2024-01-10,"Hey everyone, I never thought I’d say this","Hey everyone I’m 23 M and my birthday is next month. Maybe it’s the shitty turn of events or my stupid decisions or even just the time of year but I’m really contemplating on just killing myself. The only thing holding me back Is my girlfriend and she’s so great. I don’t know how to really start this so I hope you guys can manage to read the entirety of this post. But in October I got let go from my job, I mean it wasn’t too bad at first but I knew I would struggle financially. I’m going to school or well I did go to school but I’ve been losing motivation on things, one of the things that’s kept me going is Photography. I have been trying for a while to try to make some cash on the side to help my mom with bills but there’s way to many bills, I’ve applied to jobs but Indeed is kind of ass because I haven’t heard anything. School is expensive, and it’s also a lot of energy, energy which I don’t have anymore. I love the people close to me so fucking much but I really don’t know how long I can keep going. I’ve worked so hard to get where I wanted but I’m starting to have to sell of things, things I wanted for so long. I’ve been full of rage towards my previous employers, even toward my own girlfriend even though she’s just trying her best to help me. I’m losing weight but I think it’s because of the depression and my lack of appetite. I was never like this not even in high school  during a stupid heartbreak. I always saw myself as seeing past these things but when I try to see past it I really just get reminded how much of a fuck up and broke person I am. I feel hopeless, I wanna help my mom but I can’t. I want to kill myself to just end this fucking cycle of rage and depression. Everything is so hard and it’s insane because how is one supposed to live a life in this world. I seriously feel like I died in October and since then I’ve been trying to survive but I’m losing my motivation to just survive. I’m in Debt, I have no motivation for school anymore and even if I did it’s not like I can go because I have to work to save money, but how am I supposed to work if no one is hiring. I’ve tried to get commissions for photography but it’s really hard, I either don’t get any inquiries or It’s just like one or two people but it’s not enough. Guys I’m really trying my best to keep going but the sound of just me saying good bye to everyone and every little issues I have  sounds way better. My girlfriend knows about my thoughts and it broke me when she said she doesn’t want to lose me. She’s already lost her best friend during high school due to suicide as well, I’d hate to put her through that and I don’t want to be a coward if I did that to her or anyone I love. I just want to be happy guys. Why is that so hard. Why does the world make it so fucking hard. What happened to being human, what happened to my innocence I was a kid now I’m an adult who’s seriously contemplating suicide. I’m Scared at thought of leaving and the initial reactions of everyone but it’s so easy if I Just let everything go."

19327xn,Depression,2024-01-10,My brain is not looking forward to the future,"Tax, betrayal, death of loved ones… the past feels like blissful ignorance, the future feels like pending pain and my presence feels numb and empty. 

I spend my time trying to seduce girls that are slightly out of my league thats the only thing that gives my brain a dopamine rush, that’s the only time I feel accepted, because women truly do what they want, so if a woman is spending time with me it’s because she wants to…

The downside is, I pretend to be… actually I don’t pretend to be confident but I only show my confident side. My confidence comes from the fact I feel everyone in life is faking/ lying so they’re no better than me… HOWEVER I feel if I show my vulnerable side they won’t be interested in me.

Which brings me back to square 1 

My brain is not looking forward to the future… wife.. kids… responsibilities… holidays? 

Maybe meeting new people? I don’t know man this world is fucked"
193245w,Depression,2024-01-10,Just dropped my one winter semester class. Feel like a failure,"I've taken a winter class before so I know they're fast paced but this one was just too overwhelming. 

I feel like a complete failure. I was in a program that covered my tuition but now since I'm not keeping up with the required amount of credits I'll be dropped. My depression has gotten so bad lately, still trying to get a new psychiatrist. I feel so stupid because I'm being overwhelmed by community college. I'm not even in university. I'm never going to use 95% of the classes I need to take for my major, this all feels so pointless. I don't know if I'm cut out for college but I need to get a degree to pursue the career I want.

I'm so embarrassed I don't think I'll tell my therapist or my mom that I dropped the class.

I want to end my life so bad. I can't keep up with school, work, and outside responsibilities all at once. I'm lazy and can't handle basic aspects of life. Thanks to social anxiety I also feel incapable of having simple interactions. I feel so worthless. I'm really sorry for going on a rant, just needed to get this off my chest. 

Any other depressed college students on here who can either relate or discovered how to manage?

Even at home I feel left out I feel like barely anyone notices or cares about me and from the people who just acts like they care I don't wanna hear this sick lies anymore day by day I feel like my life is falling apart I just wanna give up but there's something deep inside me that keeps me from giving up sometimes I say to myself just ignore them but I can't..

   i hate this and i know all of this is wrong. i think if i focus on all of these flaws and problems im facing and think they are standard, it will only drive me further into them. however, knowing they arent normal makes me feel stressed all the time. overall it just feels difficult to go out and do things"
1931yja,Depression,2024-01-10,Can you be high functioning and still have depression?,"Stupid question yes I know. 

I know there is high functioning depression. 

My psychiatrist had diagnosed me with MDD, GAD, and panic disorder in my medical records

And so did my primary care doctor 


I def have GAD and panic disorder. I was diagnosed by a psychologist at 17 with PTSD also. 

I just am not the type of person to be “sad” though. 

Like I go to the gym, I go on walks, I do good in school. But I also notice I lay in my bed with my bedroom door closed and scroll on my phone a lot for hours on end, my room is often messy at times but it eventually get cleaned. Etc. 

Recently I’ve been feeling down / disassociated / not a lot of energy, but I also have been dealing with some outside circumstances for sure. So that plays a part."
1931wsz,Depression,2024-01-10,Any tips to fix foggy brain? Is this from depression?,"I feel really foggy most of the time. It feels like my vision is out of focus. It’s not, I can still see everything if I try. But everything feels blurry. I don’t know if this is a depression thing? I also get dissociation but I think it’s a bit different. With that it makes me feel like the world isn’t real. Like maybe I’m dreaming or something even though I know I’m not. Like I’m not actually here. Sometimes it feels like everything’s blurry unless I really try hard to focus on something. But even then it’s just that one object that comes into focus and the rest still feels blurry. I’ve had my eyes checked and they are fine. 
It’s really unpleasant and bothers me a lot. I feel like it makes things worse. 

Does this sound like a depression thing?
Any tips for how to help it go away?
Could there be other health issues causing it that you know of?"

I get it, they are all extremely talented and gifted, and don't deserve any failures, because they are unlucky. I on the other hand don't really see the world that way and haven't really thought of myself as unlucky or unfortunate. That must mean that I'm actually extremely lucky and fortunate. Despite this, I have no talent and result to show for it. I am truly the worst kind of person; not unlucky, therefore lucky, yet have nothing to show for it."

There’s nothing like competing in front of a thousand people to get your blood pumping. I haven’t felt alive in years. Got injured and lost all my scholarships. I feel like sports were the only thing that got me out of bed in the morning now I can’t find the energy to do anything I dropped out of college(flunked out really) quit my job and moved back in with my parents.

1931ofz,Depression,2024-01-10,I knew how this was going to end since elementary school,"I knew everybody was lying to me then. With their fake ass stories, and scripted ass birthday parties, and fake school activities.

You are a town full of hicks, and you might as well own it. Idk why you got offended at me hating the fuck out of that place. Your role in that town was completely different from mine. It was put on me for as long as I can remember.

Even when I made them smile or laugh - they never once considered the fact I deserve to have the truth. I was always going to be left in the dark.

I refuse to make the decision to live life. I will make that decision every day. No more gym, no more restraunts, I’ve cut off family, I’ve never had real friends, I won’t even leave the apartment unless I have to.

It’s because of elementary through college. I give up. You win.

Idk if I’ll get my license and gun in a few months like I wanted to. But I’ll get there at some point. It’s the only thing I’m working towards.

Everything is secondary to that.

I’m pretty sure everyone irl think this is for attention or me just trying to prove I’m at rock bottom so I can justify getting help.

I’m never getting help, because it won’t help. My problem has always been too many hicks made it a priority to lie to me. They already fucked my life. My Brain is already fried.

It’s cool though, maybe they can look back in 20 years and think about how much of a huge fuck bitch they are."
1931lvj,Depression,2024-01-10,Feeling so lost,"Man, life really fucking sucks sometimes. This might be more of a vent than anything, but I felt I needed to say it out loud to some kind of an audience. 

So lets start a year ago, life was pretty good. I had a job i took 3 hours away, but near my moms place as my wife and I were looking to move out that way anyway. I would stay at my moms during the week and come home on weekends. It was rough, but doable. It actually helped myself  and my wife to do a lot of self-development and focus on ourselves for a bit instead of each other all the time. I spent my days working, and my time off work doing side jobs to save as much as possible to buy a house. Cleared our debt, had a nice stack in savings, planned a vacation for the first time since weve been together, things were looking up. 

Next thing i know my dads cancer came back, my wife gets promoted and doesnt want to move anymore, and now I put in my resignation to be back home with my wife after 13 months, and to be closer to my dad. I see things starting to come down around me but try to be as optimistic as possible. Still debt free and money saved, still alright. I figure well why not give a go at starting my own business, since i had been making good money on side jobs anyway and have always loathed having someone else profit off my labor more than I even do. Plus, that will allow me some freedom to spend time working towards a long time goal of mine. You may think im insane but I have been trading off and on for 7 years now and doing pretty well. I thought having the freedom to be able to properly prepare for the market, journal, review my trades, etc. would help get me closer to my goal. Seems like a good plan! 

Wrong. Oh so, so wrong. 

It started out decently. I was making enough working for myself to keep up on bills (Im a mechanic btw). Had my time to work towards my goal. Then things start gettting tighter as work started to slow down, and then the vacation was coming up. That vacation ended up costing twice as much as originally planned. This was mid october. So bam, here i go watching those savings i worked my ass off for over a year to save, just start getting demolished. Alright, time to apply for jobs before this gets too bad. 

HUNDREDS of applications and 1 interview that was the biggest bait and switch i ever experienced. Meanwhile work gets slower and slower, savings started going faster and faster, card balances start going up and up again. Then i get a little break with trading, get a few payouts and i can breathe a little. But not enough to replace an income, so still draining savings and running up cards. Still putting in applications everywhere, following up, applying for jobs im overqualified for, and yet still fucking nothing. 

Now cards are maxed out, have a whopping $250 in savings, lost my funded trading account accidentally by breaking the firm's trailing drawdown rule, and still fucking zero calls on any jobs.  Oh AND i may have MS now as well, on top of all this. I feel like my life has just been a spiral of which i dont know how to stop anymore. I dont know what i can do if i cant find employment. Jobs ive been doing are few and far between at the moment, mainly due to colder weather people dont call a mechanic out to lay on their frozen driveway for hours. While trading was going well, its not something you can force into fruition on your own timeline, and it takes time to pass an evaluation for a funded account again, and i dont have the funds to trade my own capital, clearly. 

We are just scraping by. I dont know what else i can do. Im pulling as many jobs as i can, applying everywhere, said fuck trading for now to focus on jobs, pinching as many pennies as possible, but i cant stop this spiral. 

I feel like ive yet again destroyed what took me years to build. Ive failed at the goal i shot for, failed at working for myself, failed to provide, just failing at everything right now. Even my health is faultering, not to mention my mental health clearly. I love working on things but i fucking hate doing it for money, and even more so for someone else. Im really talented at my job, but doing it for money makes me hate it. So now i question my whole identity because i cant even do what Im good at unless someone else profits off my slave ass labor. And nobody even wants me as their employee evidently, which is also completely new to me. Never had any issue getting a job before. 

Its like at this point, what the fuck is the point anymore? What the fuck can i do? Either im depressed and broke, or depressed working somewhere i hate, or depressed failing at a goal i set for myself. No matter what i feel like its just failure upon failure and more depression. It makes it even worse how bright everything looked a mere 5 months ago and how excited i was to get to work towards the things i wanted. 

I just feel so lost and feel the darkness slipping in that ive worked so hard to get out of before. This time feels worse because everything is just crashing around me at once, and no matter what im doing i cant make it stop. I cant make someone hire me, i cant make myself magically good enough for another trade, i cant stop bills from coming, i cant achieve my goal right now, just cant quite do anything except watch everything i worked for so hard for continue to evaporate in front of my eyes. 

Im could never off myself, ive seen the effects of that and know it is a permanent solution to a temporary problem. But i do find myself lately idealizing death as a solace from watching my life crumble. I just want something to clog the gears of this decline somehow, fucking throw me a life vest man.  

I feel like an idiot now too because i know so many people are so much worse off than myself, but god damnit if this isnt painful. 

Thank you for being my audience."

 I recently experienced some domestic violence concens at my neighbor's house. The husband left and the wife is now safe. But this unexpectedly brought up a lot of childhood memories. 
I'm doing all the right things, have a therapist, have a referral for a psychiatrist for medication review. 
But all of the ground techniques, compartmentalizing, and using previous methods to help calm my mind are not working.

I think weed induced my depression, anxiety and schizophrenia. Even when i knew it wasn't doing anything good for me i still did it to fit in, and i have no one to blame except myself. I seen how good of a life my younger brother is having and i think ""I wish i had his life"". He's in high school and has good friends that he hangs out with, which i never reallly had. His life is lively and i notice how mine wasn't. I wanted to have good friends but i was never really close to them. I wouldn't hang out with them outside school, i always wondered how to become better friends but it never really happened. I'm gay and sometimes the boys would notice that and they would make fun of me, which made me hate myself. I notice that i let myself go the last few years because of depression, anxiety and schizophrenia. And it passed by so fast, just thinking about it like it happened in a blink of an eye. My therapist told me to be nice to myself, but it's hard to when i knew what to do. Almost everyday i look to my past and feel regret, sadness and frustration that i wasted my time in negativity. I know i can only look forward but a lot of times i feel like just breaking down and crying it out, even though i cant really cry."
1930s40,Depression,2024-01-10,There's seemingly no hope even when I try,"I've been trying multiple things just to maintain a basic level of sanity, but it's just not working. People in my life aren't making things any easier in most ways either. I'm tired of having to deal with other people's opinions and baggage. I have been diagnosed with major depressive disorder and generalized anxiety disorder since I was 13, now I am 21. I think I might have OCD as well. I've been trying different things and nothing works except for my meds which I wasn't able to take for several years. That was because my mom thought I wasn't taking them when I was 14. I didn't get back on them until recently, some months ago. But my depression has constantly been getting worse and worse with time, it can't even remain at a manageable level. In 2021 I tried taking a cannabis edible to see if that would help with the depression and anxiety, but it only made it way worse. It caused me to start feeling depersonalization and derealization even. I have been getting numbness tingles on and off for about a year and a half to two years now. It's only recently gotten better within the past few months, but I ended up feeling it again a few days ago.  
  
I've been trying to get help by taking my meds and talking to my parents, and they got our family a therapist. But in one of my one on one sessions with her she basically said that I can't be that depressed if I am still getting up to go to work and school. This is a prime example of how therapy has just never worked for me, my therapists usually misread me and I rarely ever get anything that I really need out of it."

I was so happy to graduate and start a full-time job because I have a strong passion for my industry and city I now live in.

I’ve been working for over half a year now, in my own place in NYC, and mostly supporting myself. My family is very loving and will give me rides and supplies even though they are 2-2.5 hours away. All in all, I am happy now, and very motivated in my career. 

However, I can’t seem to move on from the depression sleep habit. I arrive at work 15-30 minutes late because I can’t seem to wake up earlier. I’ll sleep around 16 hours on the weekends if I don’t have plans to go out. Then take a nap after I eat and check my phone. It feels like I can sleep anywhere anytime. I unwillingly trained my body to go into deep sleep because I was used to using it as an excuse to not feel and not do my responsibilities. I’ve always been a heavy sleeper but sometimes it feels like I’m waking up in the middle of my cycle and can’t function even if I sleep all day.

I’m about to adopt 2 cats, hoping it will help motivate me in my home life and give me a stricter routine. But even as I am so excited to welcome them home, I’m in bed staring at all the boxes of supplies I need to set up. 

This is partially a rant, I know if I slowly work on a routine it should get better. I’m just annoyed at my body.

TLDR: I’m not depressed anymore but I still sleep as if I have something I want to avoid."
192zoww,Depression,2024-01-10,no point,"i've been off my meds for a few days as i'm waiting for a refill and these depressive feelings have crawled up and started to haunt me so awfully the past 2 days. 

  
nothing in life feels like it has any meaning anymore, even if i make a list and completely agree with wanting to do all the things on it i feel like i have no energy too and will feel NOTHING for doing them. i feel like my life will just be a constant chance of money, dopamine and anything else to fill this void in my heart and i'll only just end up dead and never satisfy that endless hunger. i feel like willingly relapsing and stopping trying to quit my addiction because if the result is the same then why would i take the long and hard way instead of just doing what comes easy? my body has just been acting on its own doing things it knows i ""should"" but mentally i just don't want too. i don't see a point in anything. my life means nothing, my family means nothing, my friends and my partner mean nothing. it's all just the same people copy and pasted everywhere and i'm just another one of them living it out for no reason at all. no one's ideals of a ""good life"" sound appealing to me at all, it just sounds like distractions from death.  


i'm not going to act on my desires to cave and i'm still trying my hardest to stick this feeling out and see what comes of it (refilling my meds soon and going for my second therapy session in 2 days) but i needed to let this out, i don't even know why. "
192zllz,Depression,2024-01-10,It's back :),"So my life was going pretty well up until the end of this summer. I had a really rough time as a teenager, got caught up in a lot of bad things, was messed up enough for a while to get various bug infestations in my room, etc. But I had mostly put that behind me. I had a steady girlfriend, was starting sophomore year of college with a high GPA, and the first month was glorious. I woke up with coffee and oatmeal outside, went for a walk, then did some work and went to class. Lots of time with friends, started a club, good times all around. Probably the best times I'd had in my everyday life, possibly ever.

Then I heard that my ex girlfriend, who I'd been with for a year right before I started college, and whose life had not been going in a good direction, had killed herself. It wasn't a surprise, but it really fucked me up- for that time, we had been the closest people to each other in a lot of ways, lived together, etc. Our relationship was frankly terrible, but it was also very intense, and she was a really special person, and had a pretty major influence on the person I am now. She taught me to drive (I was 18 when we started dating, hadn't learned yet because lockdowns), to speak up, to be more myself, and I tried again and again to keep her from hurting herself and help her get her life on track. I still listen to her music, and I always will. 

I was trying to get back on track after this, but unsurprisingly, I think, not doing that well.

And then the girl I was with at the time, who I thought I was going to marry, dumped me on Thanksgiving, over the phone. Oh, and I got a speeding ticket, which I deserved, but which I am still worrying about now because my home state will suspend your license for most speeding tickets, so I need to get a plea deal or else I'm fucked because I go to school OOS. My family's well off which helps, but without the ability to drive myself I am in a very bad position, especially because my school is in a small town an hour away from any major airport. 

After that I pretty much became a recluse for the rest of the school year, not wanting to see her around for the last few weeks and not wanting to go out in general. I ended up doing well grades wise, but I've been laying around doing nothing all break, save for the family get together, which sucked because my grandfather is slowly dying of Alzheimer's and my grandma is taking it out on everyone else, and an interview for an internship this summer. I really need to get my shit together before school starts, but I'm in a fog, and while it's nothing like my awful teenage years, it's rough, and I'm worried. I took some of those online tests and they confirmed that yeah, I'm not doing so hot anymore.

Anybody have advice, or sympathy, or something? I've had trouble really going into how messed up I am over everything to people I know, outside of a few incidents, because I don't want to spill this on people if I can help it."

I dont even want anything but why do i have to still suffer in this world. Every small things for others and big deals for me.. It makes me anxious and gets crazy...There's no one to help me..they just judge everything like and complaint about everything more than me, I never say a word about the pain in my head, maybe I should tell them..but i know it doesn't matter, somehow they knew I needed help but they think I'll get over it someday. I wish I could too, but I'm just weak..I'm just a girl with a dream that never get to be realistic, maybe this is it, this is my life..maybe I should've wanted less...."

so i’m a (20m) and i live alone in a 1 bedroom apartment with me any my cat, and i’m in need of some help

so lately these past couple of months my life has been extremely boring, i go to work, come home for a few hours and just hangout and really just do nothing all day since there really isn’t much for me to do, i go back to work and rinse and repeat, i only have very few friends and i’m not in a relationship currently and i’ve kinda just been sitting in my room and doing nothing

i used to have a good amount of hobbies i used to do such as drawing, journaling, video games, hiking, reading and so much more but due to different mental illnesses i’ve been diagnosed with and living with loneliness on top of that too, i honestly just feel empty, i want to start drawing again and picking up past hobbies i used to do and i would like to find some new hobbies and try something different, i want to make some friends and meet new people, i want to be able to wake up everyday and have something to look forward to or have something to do to keep me busy throughout my day.. something exciting 

basically what i’m trying to say is.. there is so much i wanna do but i just don’t know what to do if that makes sense? i wanna travel more, i want to pick up the hobbies i formerly used to do in the past that made me happy, i want to meet new people, try new things, go to different places, i want to move out of my home state again and live somewhere like alaska or canada maybe? i don’t know yet, and i also want to improve my mental health and get better again but either way to whoever may see this, if there is anything suggestions you might have rather it be new hobbies or something, or what i can do to change things or to point me in the right direction, let me know, please and thank you"

192z4hd,Depression,2024-01-10,i hate life,"Its 4am and i cant sleep. I rarely post anything on the internet but i have no one to talk to. I hate life. I wake up every day to go to school, trying not to fall asleep. I put on a smile, make people laugh, and talk to friends, ear plugged in, listening to music all the time, even in class. I can’t share these thoughts with my friends. They would think that it is corny. They know that i am always happy and telling jokes. I hate the real world, it is miserable. I am graduating soon, I feel stressed. Just turned 19 a coupla days ago. I am sleeping all day, binge-watching animes, and thinking “that world is so much more beautiful than mine”. You are probably thinking that it is so corny to say that. You are right, but i dont care, thats what i think. 

I feel like that my life has been nothing but stress and sadness since i turned 16. Ive been dealing with depression since then. The constant cycle of waking up and doing nothing (although i have several hobbies) is just so miserable. I dont know what to do. I hate my life and myself. I have attempted suicide on my birthday last year. I am so lost. 

I’ve been feeding these dumb thoughts to myself that my life will change somehow. Maybe somehow i die and i can finally rest or i get to live in an another life. Maybe virtual reality will become a bigger thing. I dont know. 

I dont want to hurt and burden my mom with these thoughts. Or my friends. It is kind of laughable really. There are people who invent new amazing things every day, or people who are constantly fighting for our future, and there is me who will be working a 9-5 and will make no progress in life. I am just another human really. I am not important for the future. No one would choose me in a room full of people, not even my mom. 

sorry for the long text. i didnt really know what to say so i was just writing the things that came in mind. thank you:)

ps.: english is not my main language, and i havent been sleeping recently, so i apologise if my words make no sense."
192z45m,Depression,2024-01-10,I hate my life,"So growing up, all I remember is being depressed. As far back as I can remember. In my 20s and 30s, I was always alone. No one wanted me. Hardly No friends, no girlfriends, no dates, no sex... nothing but loneliness. I finally met someone who paid attention to me in my 40s. I settled and married because I was desperate, lonely and depressed. But I married her for the wrong reasons. Turned out she fabricated her life, personality, likes, etc. They were all a lie to trick me. Two kids later, I've learned that I am still severely depressed because I'm still lonely and unloved. Then I met her. She had a similar story and we just clicked. I finally felt what true love felt like.it was really the first time I felt happy Then... ghosted. I was devistated. Three years later, she reaches out. During those three years, all I did was think about her because of how I felt. I not only lost love, I lost happiness. Turns out, she used me because I gave her attention. She never loved me.

So I lay here alone and crying knowing that in 50+ years that not one person has ever loved me. Not one person cares about me today except my 9 y/o son. The one person whom I love doesn't love me back. 

 I am So depressed that if literally hurts. Been depressed for more than 30 years and I'm tired of it. But more so now because I was used by someone I love. 

I really wish I could just die in my sleep tonight."
192yxf3,Depression,2024-01-10,At what point is it just an excuse?,"I live with an old friend of mine. He’s on medication as well and has been clinically depressed for years. 

Bout half a year ago he moved in with me as he needed a place to stay. I obliged bc of the situation he was going through and I truly cared for him as a friend. As time went on I felt super disrespected by the way he treated my house that I own and my things. He’d never clean, leave trash everywhere, cross boundaries constantly, fuck up things that had sentimental value to me and pretend it wasn’t a big deal, damaged parts of my house, etc. it has made my mental health plummet even though I was doing so well for so long. I had to restart therapy it got so bad bc of him. For a little bit I played mom til I got fed up and called him out on it. He used depression as his reason and that his brain doesn’t work that way. Fine, I get it, it’s fucking hard. This cycle continues for a bit. Two months ago I finally had enough and basically threatened to kick him out if he didn’t shape up and he agreed he was going too far and would clean more. We made a chore chart like my parents used for me when I was a KID. We greed to a schedule, I took away his privilege to use anything that’s mine without permission. This lasted two MAYBE 3 weeks at most. He’s back to not doing jack shit and always in my space. I do not get a break away from him at all since he “works” from home. I can’t help but feel he’s just being a punk ass bitch bc he knows it annoys me and im charging him practically pennys for rent. I’m just so worn down it’s ridiculous. I’ve gotten to a new low after so many years bc I just feel disrespected and things I worked so hard for he’s fucking up. He’s supposedly on medication but isn’t even trying to do anything to better himself. He drinks and smokes all day. That’s all he does. Barely any other friends it seems, doesn’t ever leave the house, just doesn’t do shit.

I’ve been depressed, and i busted my ass to grow as a human and feel better about myself. and I feel like I’m slipping back. I was never a shitty ass roommate though. I never felt entitled. Does it seem like he’s just using depression as an excuse to walk over me and my boundaries? At what point does being depressed become an excuse? I don’t want to be the guy to claim it’s bullshit, but it sure fucking feels that way."

I'm 21 now and I self-harmed a lot in high school and stopped 90% of the time for about four years. I've recently been cutting myself again and it's worse than it was before. I'm cutting deeper and more frequently than I was at the height of it in high school. Sometimes I dissociate and I can barely feel it and I don't realize that I've cut relatively deep and that's obviously not good. I guess I just don't know what to do. I can't seem to motivate myself to stop because at the end of the day I'm not cutting deep enough to seriously harm myself and it is helping me cope with my situation. Just don't know what to do"

If I didn’t have a daughter, I don’t think I’d even consider checking myself in because I wouldn’t see a point. 
My step dad committed suicide when I was 21. Even though I know that it isn’t my fault, it weighs hard on me. 
My daughter makes me happy every day. My overall mood could be shit, but there is still moments that are positive because of her. 
I love watching her grow up and learn new things. I love hearing her say she wants to cuddle with dad. I don’t want to miss her life. Most of all, I don’t want my happy kid to have sadness because of me. I feel like being a dad is the only thing I’m actually good at in life.

192ys1a,Depression,2024-01-10,I’m not trying to kill myself. But I’m not trying to live either.,"Hi. I’m 21F. Things have just been going wrong and worse for I don’t know how long. 

Three months ago I was diagnosed with an illness ess which is not classed as terminal but will limit my life span. Great. 

Two months ago I was in a bad car crash. I broke my arm, hand and leg. The car was totalled. Awesome. 

My partner of 3 years broke up with me while I was in hospital after the crash. He left to get back with his ex who he had “never stopped loving”. I didn’t see the voicemail until 4 hours later when I came out of surgery. He knew this and that’s why he did it.

Im now performing poorly at work, going from the highest achiever in my team to one of the lowest. Sorting my car out and other bits while I was off work unpaid has landed me in debt. Even better.

I don’t know what to do anymore. I have slept a total of 17 hours over the last month and yet again, as I type this at 3:45am, I cannot sleep here either. 

I have struggled with mental health since I was 14 when I first attempted to commit. I was diagnosed with major depressive disorder at 15 and was medicated up till 2 years ago. I was so happy to go off my meds. Everyone constant tells me how better I’m looking and I don’t want to let anyone down. 

I won’t try kill myself tonight. I won’t try tomorrow or the day after. I just wish I had died in the car accident. I know that’s selfish and it’s the “easy way out”. But every inch of my being wishes that was the outcome. 

Although I won’t seek death; I will welcome it with open arms. I won’t look when crossing the road. I won’t eat for days until someone offers me food. It’s a difficult mindset to explain."

192ymfk,Depression,2024-01-10,Unlucky in the most unexpected ways,"I've been struggling a lot in the last half a year and this internship opportunity was my last chance to get everything in order.

I have excellent academic record and a lot of experience. Getting an internship abroad is a way to quit my war-torn country, in which I can only study online, and yet...

While my GPA is 98 and I have multiple proofs of it being specified correctly in the application, the organizers messed it up. The application has been presented to the reviewers with the GPA of 90.
It wouldn't have been a big deal if my resume hadn't stated that I (which is true) am rated at the top of my class currently. Likely it was considered deceiving, so my application wasn't even taken in consideration by any of the hosting professors.

I contacted the organizers immediately after spotting the mistake on the internship platform, but they refused to fix it, even though the blame is completely on them.

Now I have the final results. All my friends I applied with (which had their GPAs presented correctly) got the internship while objectively having worse results, less certifications and no industrial experience.

To my surprise, I am very happy for them and in no way jealous. It's just this void of being that unlucky and unworthy eating me from the inside. My life hasn't ever been going that horribly and I feel about to break.

I have felt like this for so long, it just seems normal. Zero signs of overall improvement. My depression keeps getting worse overall. Honestly, I have nobody to talk to and I feel so hopeless about my future. Some things about my past that I have done I will have to take to my grave. Those things will haunt me until I die. I hate myself every for every stupid thing I've done. I feel like I'm in my own world constantly anymore. I'm constantly paranoid and on edge. It feels like everything will come crashing down in some way I can't expect. That's why I am always so paranoid. Bad stuff won't happen if I am expecting it. I know that's not true but my mind and the way I think is so warped. Everything is so warped to me due to the isolation. I believe I will never achieve any of my goals, I will just slowly rot away as a coward and die. So much goes on in my head on a daily basis it is hard to function. Therapy hasn't worked, nothing has. I don't feel like anything will fix me.

It's like by rejecting my offers of kindness they are saying my love isn't good enough. It's not one or two people either it's several over years and years. I'm a good cook, I'm a good listener and I pay attention to small details so I know what people like so the gifts are appropriate and things they should like. These are family members and close friends so I'm not like creeping out the girl in my yoga class or anything. Even my mom (who is mentally ill) gets aggravated at me for buying her something she said she was out of or needed. It just is so confusing.

192y6u1,Depression,2024-01-10,The Endless Cycle of Hope,"I can either accept the slow death or the quick one. That's the only real choice that matters in life.

 I could live my life out and hope to make it better. That might lead to me simply being alive and breathing but with no real life in my body. Who knows, hope is a fickle thing. But, choosing to live also has it's costs. The pain would be immense, the loneliness, and the humiliation. If I didn't believe in god I would say he must hate me. Can't do much right can I. Tried and failed to get into medical school, it's ironic that I'll probably end up in a stretcher at some hospital. I could let my life go on and suffer for a while longer. At least there's potential, even an astronomical chance is still a possibility however unlikely. 

Or I could not. I doubt if I did it that I would even  try to rationalize it. Afterall there's really nothing rational about life. I would probably end it after some intense pain had subsided. Colored by my impression of the world after many moments like that, I'd probably want to save myself from being hurt any further. 

I don't really exist in this world anyway. No one sees me, no one sees even this lonely cry. Invisible. I may as well be dead already. Even now, I'm only speaking to myself essentially. Pretending that words I type up on a computer in a lonely room have any bearing on reality. I am inconsequential. What can I really hope to achieve when even hope itself is painful. 

Maybe it would be nobler to throw my life toward a greater cause. Die a prettier death. I often find myself doing that in my dreams. Martyr to something that could redeem my failure of a life. I'm always dying with my face toward the sun. The last bit of warmth, the only friend I can say goodbye to. I don't think so. Life's not fair enough to offer me that kind of redemption.

I'm a stranger, too strange for this world. Maybe it's because I locked my heart away. I'm not sure I'm even human.

I already said that I tried and failed to get into medical school, but in truth I've tried and failed twice now. I turned to other things to try and fix my life, but seems like I'm stumbling there too. I've worked out to the point of probably causing permanent damage to my body to not even become marginally stronger. I worked dead end jobs hoping that it would lead somewhere. I tried my best to change everything about myself. I pushed myself farther than I thought possible, after all if death was the only other thing looming then I had nothing to fear for my efforts. Dying in the process would also be in line with my desires. I hardly recognize myself but I am still the same. The same boy trapped in hell. A boy no one could love. Least of all himself. 

Hope. Some time ago I was so desperate to cling to life that I hoped for hope itself. I had nothing, have nothing. What is hope even, just lying to yourself to get you through the days? One after the other, just telling yourself that this time it'll be different. Stuck in the same loop. Try, fail, repeat. Try, fail, repeat. The only change is the weight of those failures on my mind. Heavy and burdensome, I carry those sins everyday. They darken the skin under my eyes, send sharp twinges of pain through my bones, and tire me like nothing else.

I could end on a poetic note, but I'd rather just say this: I am in pain always, and from what it seems like forever. I am tired and alone. Most of all I'm invisible. A phantom of pain and sorrow. I sometimes wonder if I'm in hell and being punished, but I think even the devil can't be this cruel. No, I'm in the real world. A fate worse than death.

We had an argument in November 2023 and she could not forget the words that I said and this hurt her feelings. She kept it to himself until she finally shared it with me last December 27.

I have tried everything i could think of, nothing gets better always suffering for what other people do and things i can't control, i hate people, hate all the things i don't have control of and that means i hate my own life.

Sometimes i wish life to be worse so much worse so i have the guts to off myself and get all this over with because that is more realistic than a stupid idea of life getting better just because. I really don't care about anyone suffering because i'm gone, i'm in so much pain i just want the pain to end."

Which I don't know if this is a normal type of feeling and or if just I'm just depressed or what? But I feel like the older I get it just feels like more of a normal regular day and I don't want to do anything at all for my birthday.

192wqe1,Depression,2024-01-10,Since I got DPDR I realized some things:,"Since I got DPDR, I realized some things:

1. DPDR can be caused because of:stress,anxiety,drug abuse, trauma,nerve damage...

2. Almost 80% people  have that ""weird fatigue"",  as they say ""I can sleep 24/7 and still feeling sleepy"".

3. Some people just wake up one day and realize they're in DPDR...other are falling into the dpdr ""day by day"".

4. Most likely that with DPDR you will have anhedonia also.

5. Your mood can only get worse, like there is only one road that leads to downfall/depression (but thats just my opinion), also since I got this I have feeling like Im thinking slower and dont have that much thoughts...literally feeling like my IQ drastically dropped/ zombie.

6. Most psychiatrists still dont know how to treat this because this is not depression (as u know) its numbness in emotions, so most likely antidepressants will not help.

It’s becoming harder to see a way out. I feel like I’ve tried everything but it feels so temporary in taking away the loneliness and sense of dread. Most of my friendships have ended where the other person just stops talking to me. Same thing with my romantic relationships, where my partners have hurt themselves in front of me or have used me.

I’m a 46 year old woman. I’ve been depressed since a teenager. I have a lot of anxiety and going outside makes me uncomfortable. I’m so lonely and bored. 
It’s my own fault I don’t get better because I don’t do the things everyone says will help. I have a rebuttal for everything. Go for a walk? Feels scary and exposed. Exercise? Willpower isn’t working. Meet people? Sounds scary. I can’t join groups because I can’t drive at night. I lose depth perception. Hobbies? Nothing interests me. Nothing is fun. Anhedonia. 
I have my two cats to comfort me. Sometimes I feed the squirrels in my backyard. I have an ok therapist. I’m on medication. 
I’ve been using Reddit as a distraction a lot lately. I’m having a Doctor Who marathon and I don’t know what I’ll do after that.
I feel stuck and trapped. Depression is worse in the winter because it’s so dark and gloomy.

192v61u,Depression,2024-01-10,"I generally like my life, but intrusive thoughts keep rearing their head","This is kind of a long vent/looking for people who relate. tw: SI

I (26F) was diagnosed with major depression when I was a teenager and I've gone through a lot of ups and downs over the years. I've gotten to a place with managing my thought life, my lifestyle and attending consistent therapy that i'm usually in an okay place these days, depending on the time of the month and the time of the year (my hormones and the seasons affect me significantly). 

Until a few months ago, it had probably been a year since I had any noticeable SI type thoughts. I usually say they're 'passive' because it's never been something I'd really act on, more like a ""i could x, y, z and I wouldn't have to think about/do/ deal with anything anymore.""

I have good friends, I love my family, I'm self employed and I mostly like my work. I have hobbies and a church that I'm pretty settled into. From the outside my life looks pretty good—honestly from the inside it does too. 

I also deal with chronic illness and chronic pain, and have since I was about 14. I have GAD, ADHD, a connective tissue/hyper mobility disorder, among other things. I'm pretty used to this stuff, so it doesn't get to me often, but sometimes I can't ignore it and it can be pretty overwhelming. 

I grew up in a low income background and have done pretty well for myself, scholarships paid for a lot of my higher education and I was able to land a job straight out of school. But i still have a lot of student loans, not as much as many, but not an insignificant amount. And i've got some credit card debt that brings me a lot of shame. I guess I feel like I should be better at managing money, but I don't by any means spend recklessly. 

I normally keep a pretty positive outlook amidst all of this, but I've been finding that harder recently and noticing myself responding negatively to things in a way that feels uncharacteristic. Today I was thinking about the life I'd like, husband, house, etc and it just hit me as something that seems unattainable, largely due to the debt I have and like the way I operate. And so the thought popped into my head ""well if you're never going to have the life you want, what's the point?"" and that sort of thought has been coming up every so often for the last couple months. 

I feel almost silly or maybe ashamed for these thoughts and feeling when my life is one I'm sure other people would be so grateful for, and I suppose I am grateful. It just feels like I keep hitting setbacks. 

Anyway, I guess I'm just wondering if anyone else experiences this?"

I am not going to sabotage them because their Teacher's a piece of shit. 

I have no friends, no social life to talk of. I did nothing over Christmas. I hate Christmas now because of it. My family either are too busy, have their own world of shit to deal with, or just don't care, so I have no one to talk to. 

I don't really put much effort into my lesson planning anymore. I've stopped caring. My lessons normall end up alright, I suppose.

For almost all seven years I have been in a state of apathy and self-hatred. I curse almost every day when I did nothing. I know that my life is not as bad as others, but it’s still hard for me to live every day. Whatever I try to do, from work and study to relaxation and games, does not bring me pleasure for more than an hour and in the end I give up. I can't concentrate on completing a task and even writing this post is quite difficult for me. But despite all of the above, all my family and friends think that I am capable and smart, they expect something from me, they expect me to do whatever I want and it will bring me success, but at the same time it’s damn hard for me to make decisions. Even if they ask me whether I want tea or coffee, I will have difficulty choosing. At the same time, every day I do what I’m told and exactly as I’m told, although this also brings problems. Sometimes I feel better and I can make decisions and do something useful without attacks of apathy and a constant desire to die, but this is only sometimes. Most of the time I just want to cover myself with a blanket and cry, but the tears don’t come. I want to stop feeling emotions and become a robot or even die, which would probably even be better. There were a couple of suicide attempts, but I didn’t have the courage, but if someone wanted to kill me, I think I wouldn’t have the desire to resist. I would like to find a solution to all these problems, I’m probably not sure about this. I know when it all started, but I don’t see a way out of the situation. I even radically changed the environment and style of my life, which really did not lead to changes. At first I felt unusual, but then everything returned to how it was. 
P.S.: Many people, as far as I know, think that depression cannot occur at a young age, so if this is you, then I'm sorry for wasting your time. Those who understand me, please share how you coped or failed to cope with this condition. 
P.P.S.: And also, if you know the means of suppressing this state or such emotions, I sincerely ask you to share with me. Thanks for reading and sorry if I wasted your time. I hope that you live your life and do not exist in it."

Now the reason I can’t just kill my self is because of religious beliefs and because of my family but mostly because of them I don’t want to cause more pain to them and just wish I was never even born to begin with because I have and will always be a disappointed even when people give me compliments when I’m giving my best to succeed at things often I can see straight to they’re lies so it’s not even that I fear death because I have often come close to it not in a suicidal way rather I was just in a lot of accidents or close calls"

Although I'm extremely grateful for my life, it has been too easy thus far, there's no consequence to not getting out of bed.

I still live at home, currently unemployed and have no motivation. I have enough money saved up that I don't feel an urgent need to change things for the better, despite knowing I need to.

It's shameful to admit, but my parents still treat me like a child who order me to get out of bed, it's rightfully so as I'm basically a man-child, rather than a man.

I can get out of bed if I need to go to work, regardless of how little sleep I have, but I genuinely have no desire to do it if I don't need to.

Once I'm up, I still do the basics such as brush teeth, shower and eat. Although I can go 1-2 days without getting up. My bed is the only place where I can ignore the outside world and act like a I don't exist.

Found out when I was a teen that my family knew and did nothing because “kids will be kids”. My aunt offed herself years later and I was the one that found her. Covered in vomit, pretzels scattered around the room . The smell of blood and bile. I was 12. 

I don’t want to die, but I don’t want to breathe, think, or feel anything anymore. My husband is not a good man. My mom treats me like I’m her parent more than she is mine. I have no one. People say “it gets better” but every day I wake up I feel worse. 

I almost got hit today in traffic. I started crying because it missed me by seconds. I wanted it to hit me. I’m scaring myself and I think my time on this earth is coming to a close. Nothing is getting better.

I don’t think depressed people really want to die. I just think we’d rather not feel the pain.

This man is a miserable narcissist who is negative all day and night. Racist, angry, sex addict, cheater, father of 2 (with diff women). One of which was conceived and born during my relationship with him. He “hates” her but wants a relationship with his daughter. This girl has a god damn trust fund and is threatening me and a my family and my SO. 
He is single handedly the biggest mistake of my life. I cannot believe i allowed myself to get cornered into this. My friends have abandoned me because they don’t understand the complexities of why I can’t leave.

I wish i had passions in life. I wish I had hobbies. 

My contract for my job was not renewed. I’m trying to get a new job and this market is so horrible. 

I miss being happy. I hate what this man-child has done to me and my joy. For about 4 years I lived abroad and loved it. I had to come home for visa reasons, and then covid hit. That is when my SO and I met. I was extremely depressed coming back from where I was living. He was like this crazy light in my life that seemed like the guy I was waiting for. He hid his demons from me and now I wish I had ran away the day I realised he lied about his age, which happened to be our first date. 

God damn guys. I am just so angry. I’m so sad. I feel unbelievable tension from the moment I wake up to the moment I go to sleep. He makes me so angry and I just want to yell how he has ruined not only my life but has ruined innocent childrens lives as well. 

I just..ugh. I am so alone. I am so sad. I feel lost. I feel dispassionate about life (I simply would/could not off myself). I don’t know what to do about this darkness and sadness."

192t7o7,Depression,2024-01-09,I feel worthless and like I’m failing. (Long story),"I didn’t think I needed help or therapy. But I’ve been battling with depression and a few other things for so long. I didn’t have the nicest childhood growing up, so I have struggled with SH and attempted a few times on my life. I’ve tried just pushing forward and having my progress outpace the trauma, but things seem to get heavier. As with every teenage angst, my depression was the worst in high school, but I tried working on it, and I ended up falling in love with a girl. I worked two jobs and maintained an honor roll to try and give her everything she wanted, including a diamond promise ring. After almost a year, that ended up scaring and traumatizing me. She got taken advantage of but didn’t have the strength to tell me. And one day she ghosted me on everything and after 1:30 a.m. Told me how I was not enough, that it was not her, that it was me, and more. I guess that was her attempt at trying to push me away? But it completely destroyed me. She promised she'd wait for me to “fix myself."" But she moved on and got with another man. It destroyed me so badly that something in me shut down and died. And the same month I heard this, I got taken advantage of, and since I’m a male, no one believed me for a while and said, “Men can’t get raped or SA'd.” It made me feel more worthless and dirty than I already did. In the middle of this, I was trying to move on and start something with a new girl, but that got absolutely wrecked. I fell into drugs and alcohol. By the end of the year I was trying my best to better myself and not give up, like picking up new hobbies (poetry, journaling, body building, and more), I tried to end my life. I was stopped by a close friend at the time. He told me “not to be a pussy and toughen up,” and I took it to heart and simply shut down any part of me that hurt. I eventually thought I somewhat moved on the next year, and got back with the girl that I thought I messed up things with. I got good at my hobbies and was even preparing for a body-building competition and a sports competition I had coming up. But long story short, when I graduated high school, it all changed, and I had a lot of traumatic stuff happen to me, including my ex coming back into my life and explaining to me partially on why she broke up with me and how she left the man she tried moving on with because she was still in love with me. I fell into alcoholism. I lost the girl who was good to me. I got my feelings played with by another person. Every single one of my closet friends except for 2 ended up being fake and hurting me a lot. My mother is a single mother who raised me with my grandma and I’ve had to help them financially and it put me away from the college I wanted to go to and settle with a local one My ex ghosted me again (I should’ve seen that one coming) and it breaks me because I still loved her unconditionally. My family is mean to me often and I can hardly rest at home. At my new college, it turns out people already know who I am because of my ex and are prejudiced towards me (which I think is extremely childish for people who are literally older than me). I’ve had three concussions, and now my kidneys are in danger of failing. And I failed my first semester of college. I feel like a failure, worthless, pathetic. Because even through everything I still love that girl and just wanna be with her and see her happy. I feel guilt for hurting the girl that was good to me and it’s hard to forgive myself. I feel pathetic and worthless cause I can’t take care of my mother or grandma financially anymore cause I can hardly take of myself. And I feel like a failure cause of school. I’ve skipped over a few traumatic events because this passage is already long enough. ATP idk sorry this was so much longer than I could’ve imagined. If you read this far thank you for taking the time out of your day to read and be interested on what I had to say."
192t1e9,Depression,2024-01-09,Can a serious flu increase your depression symptoms?,"Hello everyone, I'll be quick. 
I recently caught a really bad flu that almost got me hospitalized.
I've been diagnosed for almost 2 years. And been taking antidepressants for 6 months (Fluoxetine)
Since I've been sick, symptoms such as anxiety, low appetite, overthinking, bad sleep have just increased by let's say ... 70%. 
I've got flu's before, but this is the first time it ""mixes"" with the depression this bad. 
I'll ask also my therapist,  but my next appointment is in 10 days. 
Quick question also, is it bad to take both my flu  medicaments with the fluoxetine?
Thank you!"
192sy53,Depression,2024-01-09,Everyday has become a chore again.,"At 27, I find myself in a position I thought was behind me. A few years of happiness was all I got. My job has become tedious, ever changing and quite frankly I feel unqualified and out of my depth everyday with no support from those around me. My social life has taken a dive, I’ve got no one to turn too, no one to go for a drink with. I wake up with a feeling of dread and go to sleep with the same. I can’t carry on like this and to be quite frank I don’t think I will. There’s nothing left for me anymore, no hope for a future worth sticking it out for either."
192stft,Depression,2024-01-09,I'm tired,"I'm 30 years old and have nothing to show for it, I have no real friends who care about me, just transitory acquaintances that feel the need to invite me to places for now because it would be awkward not to. I have no career, just dead end contract work that leaves me scrambling every couple of months. No relationship of any kind, just dates every now and again that let me get my hopes up and fool myself into thinking I could be normal or have someone that feels anything for me. Even with my family, I'm the odd one out constantly living in the shadow of my 'normal' sibling who just effortlessly has all the things in life I wish I could have a taste of. 

I've always been a quiet person, but it's a horrible feeling to not even be able to talk to your parents, to just have nothing to say, to feel that constant disappointment from them even if they will never vocalize it. 

I've tried to help myself through medication, therapy, and anything else that I could think of but I'm just tired of fighting the inevitable, I know how my life ends."
192sn9c,Depression,2024-01-09,I should be happy,"I’m 19(M), pretty good health, loving family, many friends, studying at uni. I’m young, I have my whole life ahead of me, I’ve never really had any issue finding dates, sex or relationships (although the relationships I have had, generally ended poorly), I’m doing decently well financially (for a student). I have so many reasons to be happy. But I’m really, really not. 

I don’t remember the last time I felt genuine happiness or even contentment. I have recently discovered I’m likely autistic (had 3x medical professionals agree, on waiting list for diagnosis) and that has given me a decent explanation for why I find daily life so hard. Externally, I am generally perceived as confident and social, but internally I am extremely depressed. It’s gotten to a point where I am seeing ending my life as a very real and possible option for me. I am trying to do things that are supposed to help with depression- sleeping, eating regularly, I’ve started going to the gym. But I just feel generally shit, 24/7. I don’t get pleasure in anything I do, I have no real interest in my friends or in finding a partner. I only socialise to distract myself from how I feel- not because I actually enjoy it. I first began experiencing depression when I was 12, and was diagnosed at 16 following an attempt. I self harmed all through out my teenage years, managed to stop at 18 by replacing the habit with smoking and covering my arms in tattoos as quickly as I could. 

This is more of a vent post than anything, but I just feel like I’ve hit a brick wall. I eat healthy, sleep enough, have a decent social life, attend lectures, exercise, I have a therapist. I’m doing everything I’m supposed to do to fix it. And it isn’t working."

But I have my own defense. I made those mistakes because those were the things I could only do. I had no options. There was no one to guide me. It was just me and still, it is. 

I am the one who must take the blame and go with it. I should have gone years ago but I couldn't make that choice. I'm paying for that mistake now also. 

Life was race eventhough everyone didn't think like that but it was race. I failed that race. 

I'm tired of losing much to get one. I lost many things to live. And now, I can see things I missed that everyone didn't. 

I'm tired of a life filled with worse and losing. I won't live a live to suffer and to remind what I've lost as a human.

In 9th grade, I'm in a phase of life where things are generally okay, but it feels like happiness is elusive. I'm struggling with depression, making it challenging to genuinely feel happy, even when there are positive events around me. It's as if the joy is overshadowed by a constant sense of loneliness and sadness.

Even moments that would typically bring smiles lose their luster in the shadow of these depressive thoughts. It's like an invisible burden that makes it difficult to fully engage in the joy of life. I'm trying to navigate through this challenging period by seeking support from those around me and professionals who can help me understand and manage my emotions. It's a daily journey to rediscover and rebuild that sense of joy that seems to have been lost.

Despite my efforts to seek help, it seems that the challenges of depression persist. It's a struggle where support doesn't always bring the relief I hope for. Nevertheless, I continue to hold onto the hope that with time and persistent effort, there will be an opportunity for improvement. It's a tough process, but I'm trying to be patient and continue working towards finding the right support for me"

192qqqe,Depression,2024-01-09,"Feeling like I've failed and even though I can adapt, getting off of ""my path"" feels like giving up","High level summary - 57 years old, a few grad degrees, career in IT first as sales engineer than a salesguy.  Good jobs, Great house, Amazing wife, travelled the world and had fun - and saved for retirement!  Lost my wife 6 years ago, affected my work, left company in 2022 and took 6 months off.  Hard to find a job, landed one in early 2023.  Been here a year and I'm failing.  I'm working hard, but not making the sales I need to make.  I hate finger pointing but the job was not as advertised - wound up kind of 'on my own' to identify and bring in my own activity.  Now I feel like an irrevocable failure, even though I know a new job that I'm better suited for could make my life really fun again.  

You know, that was a heck of a summary!  Not much to add here but... for a long time I felt like I had it made, that I had it all planned out, that things were great.  Not perfect, but great.  I made some regrettable mistakes with friends and loved ones, including my wife, but all 'little' stuff.  Losing my wife suddenly... it made me realize that the concepts of life-planning and control are just illusions.  I know they're illusions, but I really miss those illusions - they made me happy and kept me from worrying too much.  (That seems ludicrous to me, but that's how I feel).  I've been in CBT for a long time, even before my wife passed, and it helps.  But my God, I keep looking at peers and friends and sometimes I just feel like I've completely failed and am ""dropping out"" or ""dropping behind"".

192p415,Depression,2024-01-09,Paxil experience,"I got diagnosed with anxiety and depression and was put on 20mg Paxil and a small dose of Klonopin. After a few weeks my psych increased my dosage of Paxil to 30mg to get me to a stable state faster. Now, I wasn’t too bad before this but I did experience a lot of anxiety and lack of motivation to do anything.

2 weeks after my Paxil dosage increase I felt AMAZING! I started randomly smiling when thinking about random things, experiencing joy like I haven’t since I was a little kid, being charismatic in social situations, being a badass motivated working machine, and also, listening to music was very ecstatic, like it was such a good experience and it brought me so much joy to listen to new music. I also didn’t feel numb anymore, alongside joy I was able to experience sadness, anger, love, and I enjoyed each moment of it because I felt alive for the first time in a long while. It really allowed me to be myself at times.

On the other hand, I was still a bit unstable, there was so much energy circling through my body that I had restless leg syndrome for a while, I was almost hypomanic at times and I felt like I couldn’t fully control myself at times. I sometimes felt like I was on top of the world and nothing could go wrong. That made me make a few small mistakes that I wouldn’t have made otherwise.

Now, after a month or two everything stabilized, I feel like my anxiety is much better than before, I am more motivated, can experience emotions better than before I started meds and my memory and focus have improved. It has now been 6 months since that high, and my psych is lowering my dosage to 20mg to see if that will also be sufficient. 

I am writing this post because I feel like I’ve been longing for feeling like I did during that initial period. And I don’t know if that is normal. For example, I feel like I was too high at times, but I could also embrace parts of myself fully. Right now I feel a bit numb (which is still better than before meds), with a bit more pronounced feelings (in a good way), and with better executive function. I don’t know if that period was some kind of mania, but I feel like the perfect spot for me would be somewhere between now and that period. Is 20mg going to be too low for me? Any experience with 40mg? I am not planning on going off-hand, but would like to discuss with my psych

Fyi, I am M25, 90kg"

192oz5c,Depression,2024-01-09,I am confused,"To be clear I really dont think I have actual depression, but lately I have been struggling and it's been affecting me pretty significantly and I want to know what I should do to help myself.   


I am in love with this girl and she is absolutely gorgeous in everyway. I have been trying to be with her for about 3 months. Almost every time we see each other we flirt and things typically go amazing, she really brightens up my day. I have asked her out and she said she isn't ready for any relationship yet. (shes 18, and has had 0 intimacy with any dude so far, which is surprising because shes super attractive however she is incredibly shy at the same time so it makes sense). She sends hella mixed signals and there are other factors as to why we aren't dating. This is what most of my negativity stems from. Every part of me wants to be with her, but I understand sometimes it just doesn't work out which is fine, although I am still trying.  


I mainly lack the love of a significant other, all i wish for is to have a GF and to be loved and do all that stuff. I've done the rounds and I enjoy it all but I really want to have 1 special someone to be with, especially since I have never had a gf and i just feel very very empty. I've always longed for intimacy and affection from the right person, but now its far more amplified since I am out of Highschool and life is really up to me now.   


Ive been feeling this negativity for the past 5ish months. I transferred Universities so basically for the past 5 months ive done almost nothing, no job, no school, just hangout with friends and to cope smoke a lot of weed (which IK, this is a horrible lifestyle, very easy to get depressed if u do NOTHING) Luckily im finally in school now so I have that going and I definitely think its going to help with my mindset. I am close on getting a job, also excited bout that, AND my pre-season football is going to start soon as well which I believe if I am still sad by then, will really save me (Football is my life). But im finding myself STILL lacking motivation to do a lot of things.   


A lot of symptoms im facing are, massive lack of appetite (which is very frustrating since I am trying to bulk), no motivation to complete tasks, i cry almost everyday, a weird one is I fantasize about bad things happening to me, like i think about traumatic situations happening to me and I want it to happen, I think it's because it would give me an excuse as to why I am sad, but I also slightly crave that pity that i would get from others (which I dislike myself for wanting, its such a bad way of finding comfort). I am very in my emotions and I definitely make myself cry and think sad thoughts, i listen to sad music, watch sappy love stories and situations. I feel very very alone, not in the I have no friends type of alone, but the I have no SO type of alone. I have talked heavily about my mental health with nearly all my friends, family and I might look into a therapist.   


I am just very confused and I really want to resolve my issues, because I need back my motivation, and appetite. I have tried to set myself a routine but i often break it just from lack of motivation. I have also used weed to cope heavily the past few months, smoking everyday just to not feel sad or think about my situation. I ran out and dont have a job yet so i wont be using it to cope, which scares me since if i have no cope, I might end up worse.  


Im going to ask the girl to go snowboarding soon (we were planning on me teaching her how to snowboard) which i am very excited for, but still if i am not actually dating her i would still always want more and i get these thoughts and feelings.   


I just want some clarity in my life, and a way to address these issues because I am NOT going to allow myself to be in this state for much longer, but I dont know how."

I also shared with him some news that he might be interested in. I also told him it is OK if he just doesn't want to reply, I will be here whenever he wants to talk or needs any help. However, he never replied. Last month, I went to his city and asked him if he wants to hang out and he still didn't reply. I know he is alive but just didn't reply my messages.

After years of hard work and therapy, I've finally accepted that I won't become him, that even though we are very similar on lots of things, I'm as opposite to abusive as I could be. Sadly, that has caused an issue, out of desperation to find a woman that I can be with romantically, I ended up in many toxic relationships with people that I don't really get along with because I ""degraded my needs"" and focused entirely on the other person. My main idea is that I do this because I desperately need the validation to prove that I indeed will not turn abusive but that's of course not a good idea. I don't know if I can ""accept"" that I'll be alone for who knows how long and at some point I'll meet someone special for me that I get along with or if I'll just say yes to every woman that so much pays attention to me and then fool myself into thinking that I do love them when I don't really."
192oqdq,Depression,2024-01-09,my heart feels heavy,"I have always been condemned for being kind. people always repeat to me that I am too kind for my own good. I don't know how not to be. I have always longed for that kindness towards me too, but instead I only receive screams and claims. I will never finish understanding why. no one never asks for forgiveness, and I will never understand why God sent me to such a bizarre world full of pain knowing how much i feel my feelings. I would like things to be easier, I would like my feelings to be less intense and I would like my sadness not to make me think of ways to stop living in this horrible world. The more I think about it, the more I consider it. Everything breaks my heart so easily, why does God enjoy breaking my heart over and over again?

I am sad and tired of no one celebrating me on my birthday, and feeling forgotten. I just feel so sad, and I would never, ever mean no harm to the people I love, my parents, my boyfriend, my friends, but they all wish I was meaner, more selfish, less kind. Friends betray me, and I’ve been sad for years. 

I just don’t see the point of trying anymore."

One of my main bullies always bullies me, she spreads rumours about me and lies about things I did as a child, STOP BRINGING UP MY PAST I WAS A FUCKING IDIOT I KNOW, she started saying stuff like this to my crush and said I liked, I again declined and she started asking her if she liked me, I didn't want anything to do with this so I put on my headphones and tried to pretend it wasn't happening. My friends always tell me they know what I'm going through. NO YOU FUCKING DONT. DEPRESSION IS A VERY REAL THING AND IT HAS A HUGE IMPACT ON PEOPLE, STOP PRETENDING YOU KNOW HOW I FEEL.

192o6bh,Depression,2024-01-09,I'M NOT ALIVE,"Life is going on without me. It's like I'm spectating everyone living, while I just exist. Something about this is very painful. Maybe, It's the loneliness or isolation, or maybe it's the lack of progress. Whatever it is, I feel like I deserve it. But I don't know why I deserve it. I'm not good enough, Not for family, friends, or for her. I hate myself, I hate being me. Maybe thats why I'm not good enough for anyone else. Last year I wanted to die, I still kind of do. but the consequences are stopping me. Namely, my family and friends, i want to see them succeed and be happy and i can't be sure i will if i die because what if there's no afterlife. However, what if I'm... holding them all back?"

Whenever I even start to think about my life I start tearing up, so I think you may understand what I'm going through. I try to block these negative thoughts and focus on happiness and staying positive, but it's so difficult and tiring. Whenever I have dreams of dying it's tranquil. In the dream I'm always with a genuine smile, not a fake one like in real life, and it's just an amazing feeling. When I wake up I get upset and sometimes I even cry because I realise it was just a dream and I'm still alive.. I've become more and more selfish each year. I know if I leave this world it will hurt my close ones but I'm so tired. I want to love myself finally but I can't even look in the mirror often and I eat with lights off even dinner. Every single problem I start and I know it's all my fault."

This was the second shift in two years and it broke me completely, i had lost all my friends in the previous shift and was just about healing and made friends when we had to shift again. I was extremely upset and then i was just numb, i didnt feel anything not happy not sad not scared just nothing. I made no effort in school and failed 10 mock exams (a few per sub) but somehow my parents helped me study and i passed my igcses( i was a really good student prior to this so those two years were really hard on me and my family, i considered unaliving myself very seriously multiple times. I didnt even have the motivation to have a bath or brush my teeth, i got this horrible cavity and i was in so much pain. The dentists were shocked i went so long without getting help. I guess this was my way of harming myself) i ate all my sorrows away and i gained so much weight. I found myself so fucking ugly and i was embarrassed to step out of the house. Either way i passed tenth and i chose science again after passing tenth in a moment of stupidity against everyones advice. Eleventh I truly could do nothing i failed physics and chem for my boards and it was horrible (i also lied to my parents to cover up my mock marks which broke them when they eventually found out) Ive put my parents through such hell. Either way, my retake was in oct everyones under the impression i did well but idek if i passed. My results come in a few hours. Ive been failing my mocks as usual. I just cant make myself study or get out of bed. I feel the overwhelming urge to cry often but i never feel happy like i used to. I miss being small, my life was so great. I am so insecure about it all….. ive been hiding from fitness checks witj every thing ive got because of my weight. My marks come tomorrow and wjat do i do bro. I just wish i wont wake up tomorrow"
192nqiy,Depression,2024-01-09,Relapsing and idc about life???,"I’m 24 and was diagnosed with depression at 17yo, I’ve been medicated since then. I’ve changed psychiatrists and psychologists many times, have tried many combinations of medication, have been inpatient three times,… this last 7 years. I was also diagnosed with bpd at 21yo (if I remember correctly). 

I’m relapsing, nothing exterior happened, I just started to feel worse and to have messed up thoughts. I know how life is, you have to work to get food, water, a roof, hygiene, entertainment, etc. but I can’t do it. The “voices in my head” tell me that I’m not capable of working, I don’t even care about it, I don’t care about anything. I can’t find pleasure in living. I’m feeling hopeless, like this is untreatable and I’ll live like this forever. Which makes me not want to live at all. I feel like I can’t adult. I’m on unpaid leave from work and I don’t care that they have lots of work and need me there, I don’t care if I don’t get paid at the end of the month or if they fire me. My parents facilitate my life, they don’t ask me for money to help, but even if they did, even if they get tired of this and of me and put me on the streets - I still don’t care. I know I’ve been writing “I don’t care” a lot but I don’t even know if not caring is the right thing to call this thoughts and feelings. This is just one thing that’s going on, but it’s the main issue.

Have you ever been like this? What helped you get through it?

192ne1x,Depression,2024-01-09,I feel so unaccomplished in life,"I’m going to rant about my whole life so I apologize for the long post and possible typos.

I’m turning 21 this year and I literally haven’t done anything good worth noting. I went through high school just studying and playing games — Yes, LITERALLY just playing games and studying, I never knew anything else — which has brought me no benefit whatsoever. I never read books besides my text books, I never found any hobbies or interests. I didn’t have any close friends because I have major social anxiety, and all around I really suck at socializing. I was even bullied all throughout junior high. I also never experienced crushes/romance, i never liked girls or boys and never found them attractive. 

I was so empty and lonely but I never realized that until now. I’m also pretty stupid despite studying for a good portion of my life (although I never enjoyed studying and I never actually mastered the subjects.) I still had to cheat to pass tests and impress my parents. 

After graduating, I failed trying getting into my dream university. Now my parents hate me and see me as a disappointment. Now I can’t even try anymore because I can’t afford it. 

I’m not knowledgeable about anything whatsoever. I’m not good at anything, and even when I try new hobbies I always end up giving up on them because I’m so bad at everything. I tried picking up the piano but now I feel like giving up because it hasn’t brought me any benefit and I always feel inferior to everyone else. I feel inferior at everything I do. Heck, I’m not even independent despite my parents hating my guts. 

I get jealous of seeing people my age/younger than me being independent, accomplished, being good at their hobbies and being knowledgeable in subjects I’ve never even heard of. I’ve never experienced any sort of passion for life.

Nowadays I still have no one in my life and nothing to my name. And I still feel like I’m wasting my life. The only thing keeping me going is caring for my cats, they’ve always been my reason for living. 

I’m not even sure if I have depression; everyone around me thinks I’m a just a lazy person. And maybe they’re right, but I just don’t have any motivation to try and do better anymore."
192ncti,Depression,2024-01-09,Never gonna happen,"I’ve officially accepted that I will never be nobody. And that even with therapy and meds, that’s never gonna change. There’s a context to this conversation. 

I have been wanting to get into the media business as an editor or voice actor. But I know now that it’s just never gonna happen. Because it’s just not possible for a guy like me (35 y/o, male, caucasian with autism and depression)

I thought I was good at what I do, but I guess not. I have education from different colleges, for editing, and different acting studios for voice acting. I’ve been trying for years to get noticed with no success whatsoever. 

So I’ve stopped trying and just realized it’s never ever gonna happen ever. All I am and will ever be is a bum without a life and career. You have to be extremely damn lucky to get noticed in the media business and I guess I’m just not good enough for that."

I just had a breakdown because my family looks at me like I’m so lazy always getting mad at me for leaving things out or hounding me to clean something like I can barely take care of myself. I isolate in my room all day , only come out to eat or go to work. I am sinking. And no one seems to notice. I want to be happy , I want to at least function as a normal adult. I have dreams I want to pursue I feel literally paralyzed and exhausted. I sleep most of my days away and I’m up all night just kicking myself for not doing anything. When I interact with people I feel like im watching it from a 3rd person view. I don’t feel in touch with myself or my body. I can’t feel anything anymore except for emptiness. For example and I know this is TMI I had sex with someone quite rough and I couldn’t even feel it. It’s like I am here physically but mentally and spiritually I am suffering and escape and I wish I could come back."
192mf26,Depression,2024-01-09,41 y/o man- Can say without pity that I have never been happy yet,"I suffer from severe depression. I have a psychiatrist I've been working with since 2016 and I can't imagine anyone being more helpful. Contemporaneously I started my current medications (I had tried a lot with other doctors), which have been beneficial.

I know what caused me to suffer from this. It was abuse as a child; a family trauma, caused by one person, which to the present also affects others in my family. I haven't lived in that city for a long time, but I have siblings and nieces and nephews who do. This person is to my knowledge a uniquely insidious abuser in that he is capable of kindness and selflessness, which allows him to stick around, while also at his core acting malevolently and hurting his family. I got the worst of it as the eldest child, but he has never even apologized to any of us. Nor to my Mom. 

While I'm not feeling super-hopeful at the moment, I have never lost hope. I would understand and have great sympathy if someone who had never been happy for one moment in their life decided to end it. It is a blessing that I have never considered and would never do that. Part of that is my conviction that I have something essential to contribute to saving this world. I can't prove that is true until I do it, and I want this world to be saved for the people I love.

Despite having never been happy yet, I have very fleetingly for no more than a day or two had almost a taste of it, at different times, when I was briefly with lovely and sweet girls with whom I may have had happy relationships, if not for my insecurities stemming from suffering from depression. Close encounters with happiness all also associated with disappointment and failure. At 41 and not even in peak physical shape either (I never have been; now I am trying), I might agree that it's unrealistic of me to think that I can land a girl or woman who is (1) that kind and sweet and (2) in that ""league."" But my truth is that nothing less could bring me happiness.

Just wanted to get this out and curious what people think about it. Best of luck to everyone."

This woman I work with is amazing, she's sweet and kind, she has so much in common with me, and she has expressed her feelings for me are the same as mine are for her. Theres just one major issue... she's married and has kids. She has expressed that she is unhappy in her marriage but doesn't think she has the strength to leave him so she wants us to just be friends right now at least until she can figure this all out. We're supposed to be going to dream con together this year and I really want to see her. The issue is her husband will also be there and neither one of us trust ourselves to behave around each other and neither one of us wants to make things awkward. I've been trying for days now to get her out of my head and to stop thinking about her and stop feeling so miserable but I just can't seem to stop caring so much and thinking about her. It has really flared up my depression and it's effecting me at work and at home. I can't sleep, I can't eat, I'm just depressed.

192ldf9,Depression,2024-01-09,"my life isn’t even that bad, why am i so depressed?","I graduated college a year ago. I made great friends during that time and I think I had some genuinely happy times. This past year I have been working in a grad job, living back at home with my parents in my small hometown and I just feel like my life isn’t worth living anymore. On a surface level, I have a degree, I make okay money, I live at home and don’t need to pay rent, I love my parents, I have 2 friends in this town. That should be enough right?

I can’t help but still feel incredibly depressed. I feel like I manifest it in a way, I am so negative and I understand this. I hate my job, I’m alone staring at a screen for 8 hours a day. Whilst I miss al of my friends and happy memories from college, I hate them. I resent them like hell. They’ve all moved on to good jobs, big cities, big friend groups. When I’ve reached out and they say they’re doing good, it makes me angry, why are they not struggling like me? 
I hold so much resentment towards good people. I cry every single night. I’m such a bad person. I have lashed out at every single person I love and most have walked away from me because of it. Rightly so. I am nasty, narcissistic, talentless. I’ve never known love in a romantic way. I push everyone away. I just feel like I’m living a futile existence. I don’t want to be here but I still have an inkling of hope for change, a better future, happiness? I’ve tried going to the gym, journalling, I even travelled for a month last year and I was still depressed. I’m holding on but it’s getting tiresome.

192l3st,Depression,2024-01-09,Need some encouragement I guess... I'm tired of myself.,"

     I'm so tired of who I am. 

Whenever I get in a stressful situation, I can't help but think illogically. And I can't help that, no one will support me because I think so differently. Recently, my boyfriend got kicked out and is on the streets. I'm pregnant with his child, and. I have gotten nothing but hate, people saying I shouldn't be a parent, etc. etc. It makes me so sad, cuz, all I want to DO is be a good parent... I feel so pushed down by people who bring extreme energies, I get exhausted after just talking to people. 

But I feel stupid. No one has helped me and my boyfriend because no one wants to help two people who 'dont want to help themselves', but we can't help ourselves. Obviously, we would if we could. But I've been in a survival state for so long. My mental state has declined, and I look back at when I was just 16 (I'm 21 now) and there was just a huge difference in how I spoke, how I carried myself, I was more socially adept. Now I am nothing of the sort. 


     I also hate everything I've been through. 

When I was young, about 6 years old, my father killed himself, and my mother cried for many hours, locked in her room. I don't remember anything but that. She then came out, and she never talked about my father again. I was left to cope with the loss by myself, a kid, with a huge heart, who wanted to grow up so she could take care of her mom. I just feel bad about it... Would I be this way if I didn't continuously experience trauma when I was younger? Would my brain be so defeated, if that had not happened? Would I be chasing after love so frivolously if everything that's happened didn't happen. I'm just so tired of myself and my mind. Tired of feeling and thinking, I'm tired of being alive. 

     Thank you very much for reading if you did. I appreciate it."

192l2w0,Depression,2024-01-09,My Pet Died,"      I normally don't struggle with depression, but life has been hard for the last two years. We got our cat, Midnight, just two years ago. She was only three years old when she had to be put down three days ago. She had Leukemia, which I had no clue that cats could get that. None of her vet check ups picked up on her having it as well, until it was too late to do anything about. 
     The last two years have been tough. A semi hit and destroyed our house in July, 2022. It made us homeless for five weeks until our insurance found us a place to stay. We had to move, with our kids and cat, three times in seven months during that. My wife took off and left me and our kids two times in the last year(Another whole matter that I don't know what to do about since two kids are involved).
     I got very close to that cat, especially in the last year. We loved each other a lot, and everyone knew that she was Daddy's Girl. She would look at me with love in her eyes, which she wasn't like with anyone else. She would start purring every time I was near her. She would follow me around, love on me, and always wanted to cuddle up with me. Her death has been tough on me, as she was the only one I know that actually loved me.
     I'm not suicidal,  nor do I plan on hurting myself. Her death has just been hard on me and another thing on a list of crap that's been seeming to be non-stop for two years."

I've been applying to work at a certain company for 2 years and I finally got in and have worked 2 days now, I also finally mustered up my mentality to a decent point where I was able to get my permit after being so deathly afraid of the thought of driving. everything seems perfect, this is what I've been working for so I should be happy!

but I'm not.

I'm tired mentally, my coworkers are not the nicest people. i understand that nobody wants to work, but we have to. but this is the first job that I've ever felt this fucking horrible. i cry to myself every break that i get, i have a mental breakdown a day no matter if i work or not. there's just this lingering feeling that tells me that i'm not made for this world, i'm not capable of going out in the world and working. i'm not lazy, because in all physical aspects, i am able to do everything and i am willing. but how do i even describe the strong grip my mind has on my every being. I've fought for this position for 2 years, but why am I the most miserable now that I have everything?

a single penny hasn't even hit my pockets and yet there are so many assorted plans for them, I will be relied on to help pay for a new apartment for my family soon. I'm also in a long distance relationship that I've never been able to arrange a meet because we're both struggling financially. there are so many plans for everything, and i just can't live up to those expectations.

I just know I am so tired."
192kik4,Depression,2024-01-09,Help I’m lost,"
So I feel like died multiple times. And it is a constant repeat from the last time I died. If anyone has seen Bandersnatch that’s death in a nutshell. It’s a constant repeat of a certain part of your life. Your energy never dies. It’s just constantly circling. I want it to stop but don’t know how. I’ve never hurt myself and wonder if that’s what I need to do to end this cycle. I really want off this ride of life. I want to just sleep in total darkness. Does anyone else have this experience? Or do I sound crazy? 😂 and yes I’m seeing a therapist and on medication."
192k8jp,Depression,2024-01-09,Why am I still here?,"Idk why, but something had been telling me since I was about 10 years old that I would die young. It was one of the most prevalent feelings and thoughts I had growing up. I’ve lost a LOT of friends and family that all passed away far too young, yet here I am at 36 years old. I just feel like I don’t belong here. I feel like I shouldn’t have seen or experienced anything from the past 10+ years. All I’ve really been doing since I was a kid was trying to convince myself that I actually like myself, and I can’t fuckin do it anymore. I’m not convinced and truly don’t understand how anyone can truly love and care about me. I mean, I fuckin absolutely hate myself, so how can any of these people truly love me? And, why tf am I still here?!?!"
192k1ki,Depression,2024-01-09,Rough Few Years,"Feeling really low today.  It’s just been one thing after another and I. AM. DONE.  

Since Thanksgiving 2022:

I was rear ended on I-95 by a BMW X5.  Basically totaled my 2022 Audi Q3.  Broke my collar bone, ruptured eight (8) discs in my back, tore my meniscus in right knee, concussion.  Boss and coworkers harassed me for missing work due to injuries.  Physical therapist and EMTs downplayed and mocked my pain.  PT rubbed his penis on me while treating my neck and back on a massage table.

Audi dealership wrecked my car worse when they were supposed to fix interior damage to seat frame and motor that broke in the crash. Taken 6+ months to fix crash damage due to incompetent repair shops.

Got 50 bed bug bites.

Got five spider bites at hotel in South Carolina.

Cut off bottom of middle finger on a saw called a jointer. Was being harassed at woodshop when it happened.

Got food poisoning for 11 days of diarrhea.

Got a tooth filling, caused severe nerve pain. The after the nerve pain went away a mysterious hard thing in a piece of bread reinjured the tooth.

Coworker was fired by our boss, but he blames me and sends me death threats and stalks.

A/C that went out in Hurricane Ian was replaced in July 2023. The new AC flooded my condo in October 2023, causing mold and water damage.

In my main residence condo, the upstairs neighbor’s toilet wax ring, tub and sink drain leaked into my unit destroying my bathroom and kitchen. My HOA put up durock and drywall wrong in the bathroom and couldn’t get a contractor to fix it properly.  I finally just removed it and hauled it to the trash myself.

A worker for the building left my windows open for three days and caused a mold humidity bloom.

I just give up and look forward to death as long as there is no afterlife.  I do not want to exist and wish I were never born."
192jv0s,Depression,2024-01-09,I'm unintentionally making my boyfriend leave me.,"I'm not too difficult to deal with; I function ""normally"" except when something triggers my depressive/anxious thoughts. However, I've been feeling extra insecure lately, and I end up letting it show, although I try not to. Once he realises there's something wrong with me, he tells me to talk to him and express my feelings, but I definitely don't feel comfortable doing so, so I just shut down.

When I'm with him in person and these thoughts occur I feel ""dead"", go to my room and tell him I'm not feeling fine, but that it'll be okay. When online, I dry-text him, but it's not intentional. I just worry he'll think I'm a burden (as much as I think he already does.) I often cancel plans when I'm in one of these moments, which frustrates him and makes him feel sad/bad, according to himself.

He said he loves me a lot and that this doesn't make him love me any less, but I reckon he's just trying to be nice. When I'm feeling good we are close to perfect, but I don't think he can put up with this any longer. I just wish he'd break up with me. I tried to break up with him twice for the same reasons, but he made me stay, so if I try again I'll just feel worse. I don't mind being alone, but I hate to feel that I'm losing someone."
192jsfj,Depression,2024-01-09,A fake happy puppet sitting in front of the monster that is me,"I used to think that there was a natural progression to life.  I wanted the same thing as everyone else.  Regardless of what I have said or done, it has ultimately meant nothing to anyone else despite its importance to me.  I am too late to change my education and work industry and know full well how whatever words and actions or behaviors I use will be conveyed.  It's obvious to me that I will never be allowed to be me.  I can only be accepted as a fake, meaningless, and worthless puppet that sounds nice and happy when the inverse is true.  I see everyones monster -- people really are shit.  I see no good in anyone; doesn't matter your title.  Do not send me sympathy, pity or empathy; I do not want or need it.  I am tired of playing the game only to continually be raped by anyone and everything.  This is not the life that I had envisioned for myself.  This is not the work that I wanted to do.  I have simply had enough of the sh\*t that I have had to endure for far too long."
192jrp9,Depression,2024-01-09,I don't want to be here anymore,"Life is worthless and meaningless. Nothing interests me anymore and nothing makes me happy. I only like sleeping. I'm always tired and sleepy. No matter how much sleep I get, one hour later after waking up I'll want to sleep again. To me, sleep is like an escape from life. If I could sleep forever, I would. Despite taking antidepressants, I feel like it's not doing much."

Actually paying attention in school. Actually doing homework. Actually doing chores. But my mom complained that I do nothing and that ""I could get a job"". Just the idea is so overwhelming. Everyone says ""it's okay not to be perfect"" and ""baby steps"" and ""badly done is better than not done at all but have you fucking tried applying that to real life? No one actually wants you to be less than perfect. It's horrible. I'm never enough. Nothing ever is.

I made myself the biggest cocoa mug to feel better but I don't. The sugar tastes horrible, I'm full and I want to vomit."

My wife and I recently separated after many years and, for the first time in my life, I'm living on my own. I'm in a temporary space for the month until I figure out my next steps. But...I am struggling hard. I'm in an unfamiliar area with not much around. I don't have my dog. It feels like I am entirely alone in the world and I'm struggling with how to process it all. I've reached out to family and friends and it helps temporarily. I'm sure it gets better with time, but in this moment it feels like being stranded on an island with no relief in sight. It's extremely difficult to be hopeful and I'm worried my mental state is going to spiral to unhealthy places. 

The situation is made worse by the fact that I tweaked my back and I feel confined to the apartment until I can properly move around again without pain. I have so few distractions -- work is slow, the internet here is awful, the neighborhood is...not ideal. Life just feels like a lot right now. "
192j42w,Depression,2024-01-09,I am not normal,I am just not normal . I don't know who I am I just don't like me why am I even born I am no good  there is just bad in me where every people are normal and hang out with each other whereas I am at my home thinking about things which I should not like birthday personality I suppose you know what I mean by it I have wasted my 1.5 years thinking which people are considered normal every aspect of their personality(I am just not able to convey properly what I want to tell you). I am so much in writing analysis If I write that way I am that personally and turns ou to be bad. Everytime I go to study and try to write all this information came in my head which I have seen or thought regarding writing.  more the age is going all these is getting worse I have recently crossed 18 now everything feels different now I feel I have no chance of turning myself back to good which I used to 4 years earlier everything was simple no writing no birthday no philosophy no comparison. I think I am just erased out of this world there will not be any difference why can't I be normal have normal interests all these interest of mine is consuming killing my innocence regarding that I can be who I want . I don't want to be supertalented I just want to be normal a normal guy who can talk to others no philosophy no writing analysis. Now also I think god is no longer with me he has left me I can no longer feel his presence I have no hopes there isn't happiness anymore . I just regret if I would have leave all this when I knew very little about all this when there was some innocence regarding all this. I don't know what my life is becoming. Iregret doing nothing instead doing a this shit which made me more shit.

192iv1d,Depression,2024-01-09,"I can’t anymore, I can only see the bad in this world, I think I need an advice","I’m 23y. I think I’m here because I don’t know what else to do. I am tired of my own mind and tired of this world. 
I have been depressed since childhood, when I started high school my brain started ruminating and having negative thoughts about basically everything, from human nature to society problems. I can only see the bad of this world. 
I’m tired of dealing with people and toxic people, I think a lot of people are just immature grown children. I’m tired of the confusion in my family; they are very toxic to each other and me and never respect me as a person; yet they say they sacrifice their lives for me bc they love me and they say things about the fact that I have nothing to complain, bc there’s worse in this world. They say that I’ll become nobody without them, they say I need them bc family is family, yet they want me to stay obedient and respect them and basically I can’t have a life outside of them or else they’ll get jealous/suspicious, they also guilt trip me a lot and I’m very sensitive to basically everything, I hate how sensitive my brain is. 
I hate being constantly reminded about how there is worse in this world and I should be grateful for what I have bc I have been depressed my whole life and I don’t like human nature: wars, genocides, misogyny, sexism, violence, homophobia, racism, climate change, capitalism, overpopulation, processed foods, poverty, animal abuse... I think we have ruined the world and ourselves. Tired of opening the news once on a while and see how bad society and human nature is. Tired of waking up everyday and ruminating about my life and the world. I don’t enjoy anything anymore. Not even my hobbies. I think everything its pointless. I’m also tired of living in general, everything is painful: cooking, moving, taking the train, having a shower…
I’m threatened by my future. I don’t want to sell my soul at a job just to survive and do some hobbies just to dissociate from how bad life is. I feel like I’m being held hostage due to my biological needs. I still live with my family, which means I’m both their toy and burden due to my biological needs. They won’t let me move out, even if i do i really don’t think it’s worth it. I have a part time job, I like it but they dont pay enough and the contract is short term, i have been searching for a better job but nobody has contacted me yet. I also go to uni, I hate my course, I didn’t even choose it, I have a few exams left and the thesis; I can’t anymore, I can barely study and I also lied about my exams to my parents bc they use my academic performance as a way to shame me bc they see me as valid only if I perform well academically; I dropped out of a uni course when I was 19 and they shamed me so badly I have been depressed for 2 yers and I barely left the house and haven’t even interacted with people. Now I don’t know what to do. I feel like I’m too sensitive and unstable to live, I think life requires a lot of thinking process and my brain is already drained. I’m tired. I hate everyone and everything. Myself included. 
My plan is to off myself soon. If anyone here has any advice is free to write. 
Sorry for the grammar mistakes, English is not my first language. 
Thank you for reading."

192idgj,Depression,2024-01-09,Am I truly depressed or just honest?,"The only things getting me through my days are music, sunsets and prayers. I feel like I’m too young to already be this fed up with life. The smallest responsibilities are already too much for me nowadays. Getting groceries, having a hobby, simply leaving the house, going to uni. Everything is just tiring. And people misunderstand me and assume that I’m distancing myself from them but really I’m just tired. And then I get annoyed at them not understanding. I know that’s wrong of me but I know that if I would even try to explain myself to these ppl they wouldn’t understand. They’re too busy romanticizing life so they won’t understand my point of view. 

When I go to uni I’m always so exhausted. I have to drag myself there and when I’m there I see “normal functioning” people my age and it makes me wonder what’s wrong with me. Why are we so different. Why is my view on life so different? 

Why are we stuck in this horrible cycle of responsibilities? I feel like most people are hiding their true feelings and get up and pretend to be okay every single day with a huge smile on their face but I REALLY don’t feel like pretending my WHOLE life. People normalized this so much that seeing someone cry in public is now seen as odd. I feel like we should be able to show our emotions regardless of whether they’re positive or not. We can’t always be happy but why does this society expect us to always be happy and to keep going at all times?

24yo and diagnosed with ADHD. not clinically diagnosed with depression but I've been so miserable for years that I wouldn't be surprised if I actually have it.

I'm so sick of having to fight with my brain every goddamn day just to get the bare minimum done and it feels as if no one arounds me seem to understand how hard it is and how much I hate myself. I've tried to post on that ADHD sub a few times but all my posts just get buried so what's even the point.

I went on medication for a few years but even after the effectiveness waned my psychiatrist doesn't want to up the dosage. Meds are freaking expensive where I live so I've gone off them as I don't see the point in spending so much money on pills that aren't helping anyways.

Right now I'm with my parents for the break and I caught a nasty cold and my mom's taking care of me bc I'm just that pathetic but it just made me think of how hard it is to take care of myself and if I can actually do it once my parents are gone and I'm on my own. then I got to thinking about all the other stuff I need to get done and it made me so miserable that I wished I didn't wake up after I went to sleep last night

Anyways yeah even though my life is relatively cushy my constant inability to get anything done while watching the entire world pass me by is making me feel incredibly suicidal. Unfortunately I don't have the guts to do it because (a) I'm a coward and I'm attached to my stupid vices i.e. video games and (b) whenever I think about killing nyself I just automatically start vividly imagining my parents discovering my body the next morning and the sight of my mom being driven mad with grief bc she has to bury me overwhelms me with so much guilt and pain that I breakdown instantly.

But at the same time. I feel like unless I take my own life nobody's really gonna get how miserable I am. Like they just think I'm doing this bc I'm a slob. Maybe I am a slob. But if that's the case isn't that more reason to off myself??

Thanks for listening to my unhinged ramblings."
192flro,Depression,2024-01-09,The bullet buffet line looks apatizing.,"""It's long... but I needed to get this out. 

Depression is at an extreme low, anxiety is worse than a chihuahua that needs to pee in a rainstorm and the hypermanic panic attacks are REALLY starting to wear on me. I am not okay. I have tried reaching out for help from those that can and all I'm told is I'm the one doing wrong and I need to just suck it up. Well, I'm not the one lying to anyone, in fact im being lied about. Im not making things up. I am being dramatic, but at this point I don't know how not to be. I've made mistakes and continue to... but the biggest ive made recently seems to be trying to help the wrong someone out, and all I've gotten from it is backlash and condemnation. 

 I pulled a gun on my brother-in-law who was trying to attack my grandfather... im not okay. It was three weeks ago and still I twitch every time a door opens, the dogs bark... go read the first line again....  He's the one lying to my family, to my fiances family, to i dont know who else. I have evidence. I dont think my family knows about the multiple homeless women, the drinking. I don't think they know about the &lt;$6000 he's given to my BiL and the homeless people. The fight that lead to me pulling my gun, was all over my gpa bringing one of the homeless women that my BiL was trying to shack up with into the house to live. And out of all of it, the thing that really just has me in the wanting to eating a bullet buffet line... he's now apparently afraid of me... because ""he pulled a gun on Terry, what's to stop him from doing it to me."" But here's the thing... he's the one who's gotten in my face, bowed his chest at me, drawn his fist at me.... multiple times in my life. Ive watched him do it my grandma, ive watched him do it to my mom. He did all of these things the other morning after blowing up on me for not knowing my stepdaughter had told him something. He's afraid... because he's the aggressor. And I now live in fear that he's just going to call the cops after our next argument and tell them the same half-truth he tells everyone else. That fear forces me and my fiance to hide, to avoid him. Which as I'm being told, is just furthering his biased beliefs about both of us. 

And to just air some laundry: Im also getting yelled at for having cocoa now, but here the thing... my gpa won't let us do what we need to do. Jade and Cocoa need to spend time together, he wont allow it because jade barks. Cocoa jade and the kittens need to spend time together, but he wont allow it because jade barks. And then people get mad that we have cocoa in the room with us all the time, which leads to the dogs go crazy around each other, but we're not allowed to do anything else. He's a hypocrit. ""Do as I say, not as I do,"" has been his motto my whole life. We can take care of these animals, mom. Gpa just has to let us. We have to be allowed to allow the barking and the crackhead. He have to allow them to get used to each other. Because yeah, as it is, in the environment that gpa controls, it is unhealthy for all our furry babies. Especially when our old lady is left in the freezing cold, everyday, and there's people here to take care of her. 

I can't keep doing this, something needs to change. And I can't be the only one to."" - my latest Facebook post.

I was abused by relatives until I was 12 (when I was big enough to fight back), my father dissapeared for 3 years during that time only to reappear, get joint custody and raise me in drug dens. I saw 2 people die of an overdose before I was 15, watched my dad die at 19.the one I thought I would marry got into drugs without telling me and started sleeping around, so a 4 nearly 5 year relationship ended pretty rough. I only have 2 friends and I can tell they are over my inability to smile. I live every day without feeling anything and experience life like it's a predictable TV show. I have nothing, no one and regret waking up every morning.

192fl1y,Depression,2024-01-09,Life feels cursed and I’m tired.,"I lost the dog I had for half my life, Ivan, a couple of weeks ago, on Christmas Eve. I just got his ashes back yesterday. In 2022, I lost my mom to sepsis after a diabetic incident. In 2021, my other dog had to be put down due to progressive dementia and cancer. In 2020, my friend died of an accidental overdose. At the beginning of 2019, my boyfriend committed suicide by hanging himself in a hotel bathroom. My former best friend proceeded to bail on our lease, leave, abandon her cat, and leave me in debt to an apartment I didn’t even want to live in. In 2018, my childhood friend overdosed, still unsure if that was intentional or not. Grief has haunted me for years. But when Ivan died, something just cracked in me. I have never been so low. I’ve developed a serious physical health condition on top of an already vicious mental health condition I’ve had for half my life. And, as minuscule as it is compared, my laptop stopped working this morning. It has all my games on it. They were the only things I could focus on to get out of my head for an hour or two. I was using them as a tool to survive. I stare through everything else. Music, tv, conversations, work. I resent everyone who claims to love me. I loved my dog, so when he started crying in pain in the morning, and clearly didn’t want to keep going, I called a vet in to my house to give him peace while I held him and talked him through it. It’s so fucked that people won’t do that for other people. I’m beyond ready to be put down. I’ve wanted to die for years, but Ivan gave me a purpose. He wouldn’t have understood why I didn’t come home. Now, I live in this grief all day, and in my dreams, constantly, I barely sleep, yet the people I’m close to all claim to love me and want me to stay, urge me to, remind me how I would hurt them if I killed myself. But they want me to suffer all day and night so they can enjoy my company for a few hours a day or see me once every 3 years, and I resent them all so much. I resent people in general so much. I’m sick of being told how kind it was to put my dog out of his misery but being told I can’t put myself out of mine. I’m sick of people using my dead boyfriend as an anecdote for how much i would hurt them if I died. I understood how much he needed peace and I never held it against him. I resent the people who keep claiming to love me while expecting me to suffer constantly to keep them from having to grieve me, while telling me I gave my dog a mercy by letting him die.
I can’t imagine anyone is going to read this, or that anyone can genuinely give a shit, but I can’t say this shit anywhere else without my doctors or therapist trying to shove me back into a hospital so I can be sedated for 3 days then sent back home."
192eu4c,Depression,2024-01-09,We Come Out at Night,"I hate depression snd anxiety so much. During the day it’s not too bad but when the clouds swallow the moon and the sun goes down, man, they make me their number one target. I’m just left laying in my bed, feeling like a dead body and I’m just wishing that the pain would end. I usually find myself thinking about the good times in my life and wondering where they went."
192fjla,Depression,2024-01-09,I feel like hopeless,"( I originally posted this on the effexor sub but I modified it here)

I'm 35M and I've been on Effexor since 2008, with the dosage mostly being 150mg. My workplace had a company wide meeting back in November, my anxiety and depression got at maximum when right before the meeting, I had a momentary thought about using my belt and strangling myself with it. I booked a doctor's appointment later that week and have been off since. When I took off, my PHQ-9 score was at 22. At my appointment, my doctor increased my dosage to 225mg and I was told to come back 2 weeks later.

After 2 weeks, my mood did not increase, I had the same lack of interest and in anything as I did when I took off, so they bumped the medication to 262.5mg. After a month (last week) they increased it again to 300mg.

I don't know what I should do. I feel so trapped, like right now I feel like a blob of nothing, like I don't feel like myself. I have no real interest in the things I would want to do if I was off work. However, when I do things I would for pleasure (like attending hockey games), there's no enjoyment and I barely remember anything of the game itself. Even if I were to slap myself, there's no real sharp pain either.

Probably the worst part is the constant passive suicidal ideation. Even right now I feel so trapped that I wish I was dead. I have minor paranoia about almost every aspect of my life, for example, a form I got from work about my time off and expected return led me to thinking that they want to rush me back or replace me. I can't push my to clean my apartment and I'm down to showering once a week (which is a real chore). Heck the past 3 years I've been suffering from sexual anhedonia as well. I feel bored in my career but I feel so lost to do anything about it. I don't even know why I get up in the morning an just feel like a giant waste of resources with no potential anymore. There's no hope. Heck, I even gave up on having a relationship (I never had one) because I'm nothing special that any woman would want me.

The last Friday of the year, after being rejected by 2 women, I thought about driving my car into a bridge on my way home. I know I wouldn't do it. It reminded me of the first time when I was feeling down back in January 2008, when I went for a walk and wasn't feeling well mentally, thought about jumping in front of a feed truck.

I don't know what to do. I've been doing online therapy (CBT) but it hasn't done anything to stop the these thoughts even though I know they aren't true."

1927ti8,Depression,2024-01-09,Managing work with MDD,"I was diagnosed with MDD with psychotic features last December after a psychotic break, which resulted in a week-long stay in a psychiatric hospital. The year since then has been extremely difficult, particularly with work. 

My psychotic symptoms (primarily paranoia surrounding interpersonal relationships and interactions with strangers) seem to be triggered by the high-volume retail setting I work in. When I felt like I was close to another break this past November, I took a step back from work for about 3 weeks. I figured that would be enough time to get my head on straight, but work is just as busy and the feelings it brings up are still there.

 I’ve applied for intermittent leave so I can take more time off, but I feel bad for being absent so often. I feel worthless, especially in the face of coworkers who show up every day with full plates of their own. I’m looking for a job that better fits my needs, but what can I do in the meantime to do right by myself and my employer? Any advice is good advice."

I am suffering depression and anxiety since my early teenage with highs and lows. I tried to work in other job but I was exhausted ass hell.


Ive been camming and being OF creator for 3 years and its the only job that I actually like, and isnt making me exhausted as I can choose working hours and days. I came out this year cause I thought its not gonna be a big deal and as I started making actual living + I didnt wont to hide it anymore and wanted to be truthfull as my mother always told me, that she wants to know the worst truth than lie.


But it turn our really badly... I told them about being OF creator for now and my mother got sad/mad for 3 days... calling me names. Now we behave as I never said this but I can feel the pressure. She says she is worried and constanly ask when Ill find a job... I can see that I make them all sad...

To be honest I regret telling the truth.... for 3 years I was kinda satisfied that I can suffer less with my depression and make my own hours and make a decent money with performing which for people strangely I also like to do. I feel that I am burden to my family. I cant lie them as I live with sis currently, I can move out and lie... but its propably to late and It also hurts . I can stop but then I am not being myself, and my depression will worsen... 

I feel so lost."
192felw,Depression,2024-01-09,What is wrong with me? How to climb back from this hole?,"For everyone struggling

I just wanna say I will be there if I can. But I don't understand what is wrong with me.

I am a citizen of third world country who immigrate to the small European country. Tbh this is the most boring country I have ever seen but it is safe and people are nice.

But on the last years I became a mess. My baby had an premature birth. Too premature. She is doing very well now. I can honestly say she is handful. All the anxiety about her went away after latest checks.

I had an attack while my wife was pregnant. I still don't know if it was anxiety attack or something else. I didn't sleep for 3 days. I paced the living room every night. And it went away. And like every idiot I didn't look for help back then because I thought it was a one time thing.

After that incident I noticed that I lose my focus on last 3 years.(starting from 2 years before attack) I was using what I know from memory to survive at the job(I am a software dev). And I got fired at last because I was literally couldnt keep up with the job.

&amp;#x200B;

Besides having fired twice(one was unrelated to me) and early birth I didn't have much trauma within my life besides usual stuff. But when I look back I noticed some stuff I should notice before. I lost interest in many things within years which I always thought it was because I was growing older. I lost interest in playing video games(for example I was very excited for bg3 but I was getting bored while playing), learning new coding skills, watching geek stuff one by one.

But most important thing is I feel like I am getting more stupid every day. I feel like some kind of cloud or gas is filling my bread. 

I tried to go to gym and meditation for a while but didn't help much. I don't understand if I am depressed or struggling with anxiety or I am just old and tired.

I don't have any intrusive thoughts etc but I feel like ı can't function through life much. Sadly the health care system of my country is shit. I need to convince a GP first to get some pills etc but I guess people using depression as an excuse for disability checks. Because of that they are kinda reluctant.

&amp;#x200B;

Tbh I have no idea about writing to this thread will help in any way. But it might be a start

1927bxi,Depression,2024-01-09,My friend has depression and I am not sure how to help best,"Hey everbody, I am not familiar with depression and would like to inform myself how I can best help a work friend of mine who has depression.

Her husband told me she is severely depressed since a while. She is not responding to my messages and I am not really sure what to do. She stopped going to work. Her husband also rarely responds to me and I don't think he knows what to do either. 

They are both from Russia and moved to Germany a year ago for work. They are politically engaged in leftism, meaning they suffer a lot from the current state of the russian politics. A lot of their friends (who are still in Russia) suffer from political repression and have been physically attacked. I can't really imagine what their life is like currently. 

So there is a cultural barrier as well to some extent (I guess). But there is also me not having experience with depression beforehand (not myself or other friends/family). So I thought it might be good to reach out to the community to maybe understand a bit better what one should do as a bystander? 

Any tips or suggestions or shared stories would help me. 

Best regards,"
191zd6e,Depression,2024-01-08,I don't know what's happening to me and I need advice,"Hi, this is a very long post, i'm sorry if it's innapropriate in any ways. Please let me know and I will delete it.

So the thing is that I don't feel very good, and that has been the case for years (not all the time, there are months when I feel alright I think). It has gotten to a point recently where I can't understand anything at all about what is happening, as I constantly tell myself that i'm wrong and it's not that bad, yet I simultaneously find a lot of weird elements in my life that I have a hard time processing I guess. So i'm just asking for someone's opinions about it. Again let me know if this is innapropriate.

\-I have made at still 4 suicide attempts (could be more but i'm not as sure that it qualifies), 1 of them got me in the hospital when I was 14, 1 of them I told my partner the night after, and 2 of them I didn't told anyone at the time. I really want to die all the time (thinking of it kinda makes me feel good I guess), but I now know that attempting to kill yourself is a lot of trouble for a very incertain result.

\-I regularly self-harm when i'm feeling bad, as a way to relieve anxiety, and maybe to punish myslef as I say to myself that no one would care even if they saw it/I have to hide it because it wouldn't be cool to force anyone in a position when they have to deal with that. I don't like it, but also I do? I recently started cutting self-deprecating words on my skin, and I tell myself that it's just to feel like I'm special, but I don't know if it's true.

\-My dad used to, what seemed to be constantly, yell at me for I don't really know how much time after we moved town. I lost all of my friends and I struggled a lot to make new ones. He said he realized something was wrong when he found himself about to hit me. So I have the most incredible chance because my parents did a lot of work on themselves and we now have the best family with my sister. He says he feels a lot of guilt, but he's one of the best person I know. Also my mother has had her share of problems in life, and she would sometimes completely break in front of me and my sister. I don't know what to think of that. Anyway, could that have been some form of abuse ?

\-I sometimes skip lunch. I tell people I forgot as a joke, but I actually do it conscientiously. I don't dare to take this seriously since I know I would be very able to just get up and eat. I don't know why I do that. I also have an increasing hard time to resist drinkink alcohol every night, I don't know if I should be worried or if i'm just creating problems.

\-I have had moments when I felt I wasn't really there. I would be confortably installed deep inside and I would let my body do the auto pilot. I could hear myself talking and it sounded like some sort of child I guess. But again, I never let myslef take that seriously since I could propably just stop being like this if I wanted to, and I know I somewhat decided to go into those states. I also recently watched myself in a miror and it didn't feel like me. Is that derealization or am I just trying to make things seem worse than they actually are ?

\-I kinda feel empty and without purpose, I don't really let myself believe in my dreams, as small as they may be, because I don't think I can do it, or it wouldn't even matter if i'd get there. It think i'm over-dramatic here, since I put a lot of work and love in what I do, even if that doesn't feel enough.

\-I recently stumbled on the Avoidant Personnality Disorder , and I related like I never did with any other description of a condition. After some research I realized It was stupid of me, since I do socialize a lot (i'm a musican and I like being on stage and playing with other people even though I know i'm not very good), and I have a lot of friends now I guess. But it made me think about the fact that I almost never talk about what I feel and I would back down at the most little sign of uninterest/jugdment. I maybe also choose to be “weird” so I can control the reaction of people by making them laugh or avoid having to trust them with my true self (wich I have no idea what that could be). On the other end, I have some sort of a savior complex. I would get close to broken people (friends and lover alike) who need someone to listen to them, and I would do it almost inconditionnaly, maybe so I feel I have a deep intimate connection with someone without having to reveal too much about myself. Nothing bad ever happened, but I realize now that I have entertained relation with people that weren't really healthy by any means. And also, I feel like i'm lying about it all ? Like it's just so I can make myself interesting or something, I don't know.

\-I really believe that, even if i'm probably not a burden to be around, i'm not a joy either, and that i'm not the nicest person in the world or the most attentionate. But people keep coming and talking to me and including me, even though I sometimes believe they just feel obligated because they're nice people. I don't know why my friends are my friends, I don't know why my partner loves me. So I feel like if I were to take the space to sincerely express myself, I would actually become a burden and they would leave.

\-I feel really anxious and scared. I think I may regularly have panick attacks but maybe not because I could choose to calm down during those moments. There are a lot of people that are close to me- and I love them with all my heart- and i'd like to talk to them but I just can't. I don't want to bother them or to realize that they don't care or something. I have been trying to see a professionnal for the past week but I have been unable to make an appointement with anyone because I don't know if I can trust them and if they are actually going to listen to me and help me.

I'm sorry if this was too long or triggering or just innapropriate. I will delete my post if so. If not I would appreciate any feedback on what is happening because I feel like i'm losing it and I don't know what to do."
191zte5,Depression,2024-01-08,I don't understand my self-worth,"TLDR: Venting about that I don't have self-worth, and I don't know why, plus our future has no hope.

I had an online session with my therapist today, and we had to cut the session short because of technical problems. That left me with some questions unanswered, and now I am struggling to process the last sentences that fell.

I struggle a lot with my hygiene, more than I am willing to admit, even to my therapist, who I am really open to. It's been a struggle since puberty, which combines with other problems to make active decisions, to make myself feel better. Meaning exercising hobbies, get myself some self-care or anything like that was always a problem.

Therefore, my therapist guessed it has to do with my self-worth - a phrase which is haunting me throughout my life, I feel like. But that feels kinda odd to me. It's not like I think bad about myself, like I don't hate myself. Maybe sometimes, when I am in terrible places in my mind, but normally that just is not the case. I would go so far, that I would say, that I actually quite like me in some regards. But mostly it is just a neutral, distanced feeling. I always thought that was the normal case, to be honest. 

Additional to that, are my beliefs about the future, where I just feel fucked. Climate change is gonna fuck us, capitalism and all technical advances are gonna exploit us till we die, and we all choose that.  With the current trajectory, I see no hope in a world I want to live in. We are getting forced to work for companies we hate, and if we don't, we are the outcasts of society. I just want to be let alone, work in my future workshop and create projects, and stuff and experiment."
191x2mt,Depression,2024-01-08,My morale took my life,"Hello everyone, if anyone is reading this. My name is Grisha, I'm 15, I live in Moscow, the capital of Russia. I have a long-term deep depression. my head is a terrible place, and I'm genuinely afraid to be alone with myself for a long enough period of time. I have a strong fear that I might physically harm someone. It seems that's the only reason I'm still alive and haven't killed anyone, huh. 

I can't say exactly what caused the deterioration in morale, but on the timeline it started around the end of summer 2021. I suddenly realized how shitty life was, started messing around in my thoughts, and that's where it got me.

Music. music is the only way to spend time alone with myself outside of the eternal paranoia and fear of committing suicide. I started listening to calm rock in the early spring of 2022, and then my taste preferences began to move into heavier genres. SOAD, then Five Finger Death Punch, then Slipknot.. Each of these periods described my morale at the time of active listening. What about now? Noise, grindcore, experiments. Enbilulugugal, The Dark Prison Massacre, Throbbing Gristle, БѢСЪ, etc.. the song ""Cut the Goatnekk"" by Enbilulugugal describes my current morale by sound. It would seem, why am I telling this? the fact is that I'm in such an Underground right now that I have a headache myself from what I like, from what I listen to. So I could at least feel something a little, but no - my brain took that away from me.

Hobby. Throughout my life, I have accumulated many different hobbies: playing musical instruments, writing screnarios, drawing, animating, creating games, etc. Here comes such a ""character"" as procrastination. it started at the beginning of the previous 2023, and then I did not fight it, because it only concerned studies, and with my ambitions, studies always took a back seat. However, now.. It's different now.. In November, everything changed. I suddenly lost interest in everything I do. I can't bring myself to do anything, no matter how much I want to do it. one day I felt so bad mentally that I experienced a feeling of real agony, as it seemed to me.

Some might ask, why don't I go to a psychiatrist? here comes the third step, which is the last nail in the lid of the coffin in which my life lies. I have a choice: either I hide any psychological abnormalities for the rest of my life and suffer with it, or I go to a psychiatrist, I am registered, and I can say goodbye to a normal life. I will not be able to enroll anywhere except in institutions For the most sick people (which I am not), I will not be hired, not at all. In my country, all at least a little mentally ill people are raked under one comb, they are treated like inhumans. How do I know? My older sister has congenital schizophrenia, she is registered and tells all this every time. That is, for the doctors there, what I am, what a person who is ready to tear anyone to shreds right now is the same thing.

I'm already silent about the selection of pills. My sister was given pills for 2 years and as soon as she didn't get sick these two years. Twice she was on the verge of life and death due to the negligence of doctors who gave her new pills. She's as good as she can be right now.

I do not know what to do. If I wasn't a coward, I wouldn't have been in this world for a year and a half. I don't know why I'm still Alive.. I just can't take it anymore, but.. I think I need to

thanks to those who read it. I appreciate it."

I recently told my therapist about my suicidal thoughts and the fact that I don't want to live that long

They tried talking to me

And I've been slowly spiraling since last year when my grandfather past away, job fired me, girl broke up with me; all in a couple of months. This was last year around April, May. Lost my grandfather first, had to take 2 weeks off for all the famailial affairs. Then when i got back i was calling out everyother day. Maybe even days at a time. I took out a loan to help with debt and bills literally a week before i lost my job. I asked them for an agreed upon schedule for less days. Apparently there was some miscommunication and they said sorry you missed a day even though that wasn't a day we agreed upon they still fired me. 5 years there and everyone else who worked there when I started was gone except me. But whatever i thought. Then 4 months go by with no job but piling debt and bills. Finally find a job and it's going well. Until about a week ago. New Years was a fun holiday for me and my grandfather. All the emotions came pouring in. Same week my ex is dating again. We still live together since we have a lease together and can't afford to move out from each other. I took a week off from work thinking everything will be fine if I had some me time. But my alarms went off this morning and I just stayed in bed. I couldn't find a reason within myself to try. I know there are reasons, but I can't seem to care. 5 credit cards maxed out and piling up with 5 months worth of fees, loan is all used up and now just more debt, bills just there like maybe I'll pay it this month maybe I won't. I don't know why I'm here. I'm 27 and I can't find a reason to try or to go on. I don't drink, I don't smoke, don't gamble. I thought I was doing everything right for a time. I followed the rules at every job. I might lose this one too. Oops. They are good people but I've been screwed over too many times. I feel like these feelings and struggles are small compared to others. There is a song that comes to mind by Zero Down, it's called down this road.

192e0k8,Depression,2024-01-09,My mom-aunt get mad over small things.,"We live in a two bedroom town house with my grandparents who she takes care that we are gonna move from in a couple of months. She’s has a lot of stress on her and instead of going to the person who she has a problem with and talking things out like an adult she goes and complains to her cousins, friends, and kids instead about anything someone within the family does to her even if it’s the smallest thing of sending multiple Text messages which she could just silence and put the unimportant calls on DND. But she says “All of my calls are important” so she doesn’t do it. Which makes no sense I mean you could just let the emergency calls go through like WTF.


Just last week I moved my Xbox upstairs because where it is positioned in the house makes it hard for me to focus on the game. Downstairs next to the big flat screen tv that they have as every other tv in the house is used. So I put the small tv I bought and own down on the floor next to mine. So last week to change things up I moved it upstairs and I asked her if it was fine before I did it and she got an attitude and just said “whatever” and walked away and started moving shit.

But she will say that “I never came to her and asked her if it was fine if I could move it” when I came to her to see if it was alright. And I even asked my grandfather if it was alright and he said he doesn’t have a problem with it. But my aunt she had a attitude with me for the rest of the day and didn’t say anything to me. If she didn’t want me to move she could have just said something like WTF.


So the other day I got in  and played to 12 I was having so much fun I wasn’t thinking about the time and where we sleep in the loft space cuz the GPs have sleep separate from each other in the other two bedrooms. So she got mad and came upstairs and instead asking when I was gonna stop which I would have if she would have said that she was tired she gets mad instead and goes down stairs to sleep which is so stupid. So the next day she said nothing to me and ignored me and I heard her complaining to her cousin about me that I’m “selfish” and “don’t care about her” which isn’t true I’ve literally asked and made sure things are fine with her she’s the one that won’t speak up. I’ve made sure that she had food if she was hungry that I bought so don’t try that shit with me.

I want to get a job temporarily so I won’t be sitting around constantly but they say “don’t get a job until we move to the new house which is a hour away”. But they are in limbo in terms of moving. I’m still in high school in my last year and I’m planning to move out as soon as I get a good job and graduate.

I’m thinking about reconsidering brining my bio mom back into my life after some issues with her abusive husband I had for years.

What should I do."
192dy2k,Depression,2024-01-09,I feel like I'm getting worse.. like really bad.,"I'm a 29M from Wales in the UK and in 2022 I ended an abusive relationship, to preserve whatever was left of my mental health.. 

Now a bit over a year later.. last few months I've felt increasingly drained of energy. No desire to do anything anymore.
And now these last two weeks I've been having nightmares more frequently than usual.
I'd estimate in the last week alone.. I've had 7 hrs sleep.
I don't know what to do anymore. I'm so touch starved.. I desire love and affection. But I don't get any of it.
And before she was abusive.. we did sexual things often.. mostly a lot of 69.. so I have an addiction to porn and doing 69.. and the desperate need for it is fucking irritating..

It's come to the point where I'm at a crossroads.. go down the path of a sudden ending.. or go down the path of a sad, lonely and pathetic life fueled by alcohol.
I mean . What's the point.. I'm deaf. Fat. Medical problems causing difficulties in weight loss.. mental health issues..

I have no likeable qualities and there’s no reason to keep contact with me. What can I do"
192dwfx,Depression,2024-01-09,Is self isolation.. reversible?,"Question for those of you who are in therapy and/or on medication and who are actively trying to get better: did you start enjoying being with people again? 

I'm self isolating for 6 years on and off and I'm thinking if I'll ever be able to enjoy human contact again. Momentarily if I have to interact with someone I have to push myself to do it, even with people that used to be close friends. I miss spontaneity in friendships. I want to have relationships so badly but I'm just too depressed to do so."
192dtoz,Depression,2024-01-09,how am I supposed to save the ones I love if I can’t even save myself?,"my brother and I have very similar issues, but my brother has undoubtedly had a much harder life, with a very severe health issue and PTSD resulting from it. 

we both have ADHD and depression, and have struggled with them for years. in recent times I have struggled very severely with suicidal ideation, intrusive thoughts, my own PTSD, dissociation, and dealing with a bunch of other shit. 

he doesn’t really have mental support from our parents, and I don’t really either. he recently confided in me about how bad he’s doing. he’s my younger brother and I want the best for him. I want to help him so bad. I’m so afraid because I myself am struggling so bad. I want to be there for him because no one else is in the way he needs. if I fail and he dies, I will never recover. I don’t want that to be our end. 

of course I also want to recover for myself but suddenly I feel sick about the fact that i’m not in a position to do a lot for him. no one’s ever helped him in the way he needed, even though he asked for it. for me, I never had the courage to ask until recently when my life fell apart. but for him he begged for help for years and got none. and he feels so done and tired from it. and I get it. I want to help him because I understand his pain and can see a path forward for him. I want to help him in the ways I couldn’t when we were younger and living at home with our parents. but i’m despairing a bit because if I get worse I can’t help him.

I just want everything for him. I want him to have happiness and self love and peace. I want it so bad that it aches, and I cry when I remember all he’s gone through. I cry when I think about how I feel, knowing he feels the same way. he’s my little brother, so I want to take that pain from him. I would do anything to take it from him. I don’t want him to hurt anymore. and I want to help him, but I also hurt so I’m afraid I will fail him. if I want to do anything before I die, it is to help him to a better life. but I can’t even get there myself. so I am afraid."
192dmui,Depression,2024-01-09,What should I do,"I don’t know what to do anymore…. I need help. My husband say always that I am boring ( in his language it’s boring as to mean that I bother him, he says I am always angry) maybe he is right. 
When I was a child I would hear that I’m egoist, crazy by my own mother. I don’t know anybody that seems to feel good with me. You will tell me « just change » but I have no idea how to do this. I feel just alone always and I feel like the worst person. I feel like a monster that nobody can love.

192dj7d,Depression,2024-01-09,i don’t think i have any real friends,"i’m 18. school finished and i’m home on my own; family is away. i had my best friend of 6 years until she drifted from me and began blaming me over a situation that occurred while we were in europe together. i left early because i was injured and wasn’t travelling well and she got so angry with me. furthermore, a very close friend ditched me out of the blue for a reason she wouldn’t explain and as a result, turned several of my old friends against me. i guess they were never really nice to me so in a way it’s a blessing in disguise. 

beyond seeing my boyfriend i’ve realised i don’t really have anyone that i’m friends with. i know it’s not healthy but i don’t have a lot of other choices. all the friends i’ve made have ditched me. i know it’s supposed to be ‘easy to make friends’ but i can’t seem to. it’s pretty sad. i’m feeling alone and sad, and feel selfish when we (bf and i) spend a lot of time together at a time and i crave the closeness to never end. i guess that’s normal to some extent, but i feel guilty. 

it doesn’t help anything that my medication doesn’t work, my therapist is on holiday and i can’t afford to pay for new meds. what should i do about this situation? how can i make new friends who want to hang out with me?"
192dggp,Depression,2024-01-09,Tired of Being Misunderstood,"Yes, life is tough and everyone struggles. But I’m tired of the suck it up, buttercup mentality from people who just don’t get it. Depression sucks your energy and will to do anything. It’s like running on empty when everyone thinks you should have a full tank. I’ve tried many meds over the course of 20 yrs and they don’t agree with me/tend to make things worse. I force myself to do self-care like cardio, meditation, yoga, nature walks, and I also mostly abstain from alcohol. This takes every ounce of effort left in my body and still just keeps me at baseline depression. I’m just tired of no one getting it and expecting more from me like being able to fix things in my life (ex: finding a better paying job) when all my energy goes towards managing my depression."
192dg6x,Depression,2024-01-09,Am I taking too many medications?,"Hello,

I'm 21 and diagnosed ADHD, Depression and GAD, aswell as an rheumatoid arthritis and essential tremor

\-I take 75 mg Venlafaxine/daily (Depression, Anxiety)

\-Tianeptine Sodium 50 mg / 2-3x a day (I am taking tianeptine currently because im withdrawing from O-DSMT, an opioid RC and it gives relaxes me a bit, without being as euphoric as traditional opiates or opioids and is less addicting)

\-Concerta 40 mg taken in the morning (ADHD), delayed onset

\-Clonazepam/Rivotril/Klonopin 2-4 mg every 3 days for the essential tremor (prescribed since 1,5 years, I used to take it daily)

\-I ocassionaly use HHC (for when sleeping is harder or feeling very moody), I also use nicotine on a daily level, but do not smoke (tobacco free nicotine pouches in a high dose - around 200 mg of nicotine a day)

\- I do not drink any alcohol at all (I like the taste of beer, but it makes me feel worse than before)

I stopped taking opiates and opiods to numb physical and mental pain and try to stop, even if I know how good it feels (I mainly took O-DSMT 100 mg 2x a day and if I didn't have O-DSMT I took Oxycodone 20's). I also managed to take less Clonazepam for recreational purposes and do not take it daily anymore and I'm asking my Neurologist if I might be able to switch to Pregabalin instead.

I am not seeking to get high actively, I know it does more bad than good, but sometimes the mental and physical pain is overwhelming. I mainly want to be active and achieve things and not be high all day even if it ""masks"" all symptoms I have.

What do you guys think of this medication combination?"

I feel like I keep making excuses bcs he didn’t actually got to hurt me bcs I was able to escape and thank god nothing happened but. I’m scared of him and what would happened if I send him to court. One of cousins I told her she said nothing. 

My brother thought I was just losing it. I wanna throw up and cry, I feel like I failed at myself as a kid. I hate this. I hate blaming myself, I hate that there is no one for me. And even back then. Whom helped me? No one. When I tried to do what was I supposed to do. I was left to my own devices. So, what can I do? Hit myself again? Blame myself again? No F that.

192d7m7,Depression,2024-01-09,Problems at work,"Hello, I’m not sure if it’s the right subreddit for this post. If it’s not, then please point me in the right direction.

I have a long history of events caused by me at work, which my boss didn’t like. I was chronically late for many days. I didn’t abide by rules of how to contact him when taking time off. When it comes to being late, we agreed that if I know I’ll be late in the morning, I can work from home.
Overall, my boss was patient with my non-compliance. I tried my best to fix my problems, but there were still reoccurring sometimes. Now it seems that I used up all his good will, however I don’t think I can guarantee to fully eliminate my shortcomings.
Now I have my back against the wall. The biggest temptation for me right now is to quit. I have some savings and thankfully I have low costs of living, so I would be able get by for some time, since I'm not enthusiastic about searching for new job.
Maybe I could try to get some kind of sick leave from my psychiatrist (I have an appointment at the end of the month - I hope I’ll be able to survive at work until this day).
I’m asking you for advice. As I wrote, I just basically want to just stop working all together. I feel paralyzed but the clock is ticking and soon something will have to be done.
If needed I will gladly share more details of my situation. Thank you."

192cwfq,Depression,2024-01-09,I’m tired of people saying it’s going to get better.,I’ve tried for so long to be me. Nothing seems to have value. I’m only loved if I’m providing something they can’t get from somewhere else. I feel like the magic is gone in love the only last thing I had hope feels transactional. I feel people use me till I’m no longer useful. I have no room to be off my A game 247 or else I’m a burden. I’m always second choice no matter how hard I try. The friends I hung out with in college abandoned me at the hospital when I thought I was going to. I’m honestly so smart and do feel like I could help alof of people like being on a team that invents new meds. But why bother help save people when all they’ve been is cruel to me. My parents who were wealthy cut me out of the will not because they thought I did something wrong but more they don’t like my personality. And then I started doing drugs and being successful and now my parents love me. My ex cheated and left me during her rehab trip while I was trying my best to be there for her support her through her trauma and the next girl took a thousand dollar phone and ran off with a doctor then I found out the fwb I had in school situation ship wanted to lose her v card to me but lost it to the hot guy at our local college. My friends I hung out with everyday pretty much ghosted my when I had an emergency surgery with a 65-70 percent death rate and I found out oh if I die no one would legit care. I’m in pain all the time from my health. Ive tried so much therapy and mental health I’m tired I can barely feel my finger which I used to play an instrument. I’ve put in work everyday the emotional pain outweighs the physical pain I have from med problems it just always gets worse

I only have 3 friends but despite knowing what's going on (and saying they really want to help/they're there for me), they still only want to do what's best for them and don't seem to really care about how I feel about things.

Yesterday I had a small falling-out by standing up for myself and it crushed me. I don't know what to do, I don't feel strong enough for confrontation and defending myself, I'm in the gutter. I'm scared to talk again (in case they bring up me stirring the pot) but I also don't want to forget and move on because it hurts that their feelings always come first.... Especially now

This all happened online via chat and my pc is my only safe place. I now live in fright hearing the sound of a chat notification. I don't know what to do anymore"
192cdgq,Depression,2024-01-09,What are your experiences on ssris?,"Hi

I got perscribed escitalopram for mild depression. I read some horror stories about long term effects and side effects that really put me off. The dosage is low 5mg first month and then 10mg for six months and thats it. Has anyone been in a similar situation if so did you suffer any side effects long term and short term? How did you feel? 

Im very anxious about starting it and im thinking if i could manage my symptoms with a better diet and exercises because my diet has been shit and i would say it contributed to me feeling this way. Also im a international uni student far away from home, friends and family i would say its very lonely time even tho i have friends at uni it just feels very surface level theres no depth, I have one close friend there but they're busy balancing school with work so we dont see each other very often. Its very hard to meet new people, especially in your 20s when you hate clubbing or partying and dont really drink. So i was thinking about maybe voluneeting and meeting new people. As i said i would consider my depression as mild ie. im able to get out of bed, go to uni and somehwat function properly but my main thing is that things just dont make me as happy as they used to, overall hopeleness and low key i feel dead inside. Its worth mentioning the city im in doesnt help, very depressing looking city and the weather is shit like 99% of the time, lack of sun has really gotten to me. "
192cbq8,Depression,2024-01-09,Leaving your depressed partner may be the best thing that ever happened to them,"I was in a relationship for 10 years with a partner that suffered the worse depression I have ever seen. This person suffered terrible insomnia, hated their job, had suicidal thoughts, found no happiness in life and would go to work then come home and lay down and do nothing.

We tried everything we could think of to overcome this, including, anti depressants, moving to a new country together, psychedelics, meditation, breath work, counselling and much more.

For me, it was extremely tough. I loved this person but found living with the negativity too much eventually. For probably 5 years I thought about leaving but did not. One of the reasons I did not leave was my fear of what might happen to this person I loved dearly.

Eventually, I did leave. Whilst initially, the breakup was awful and my partner begged me to return,  within only 2 months my ex has had a spiritual awakening and is no longer depressed. Whilst it hurts seeing them become the person I always knew they could be, but without me, I am extremely happy to see them relieved of their struggles at last after all of these years.

If you as the partner of a person suffering severe depression are going through this internal struggle, thinking about leaving but terrified of the consequences, understand that it is possible that the leaving your partner may force them to confront their demons. It is possible that they are not happy with you but do not realise or know why and have never communicated it to you.

This may not be the outcome in your situation, however, it is a possibility that you need to consider. It may not happen as quick or at all but it may be the best thing that you can do to help your partner."

192c8qu,Depression,2024-01-09,I don’t understand what keeps people going in life/where they get the motivation while being all happy and cheerful,"I’m 20 in college and I just don’t get how people are so satisfied/content with this monotonous lifestyle where people really aren’t even getting that great of an education at this shity college I go to. 
I keep trying to do things in life because I want to keep myself occupied that’s why I went to college but I just don’t see the point of doing all these things that society says are going to better yourself because in the end I don’t feel any better and still feel like I have amounted to nothing in life. 
-The last time I was genuinely happy was about 5 years ago
-I am a junior in college and still don’t have any true friends, only people that associate with me but I’m always their last choice of someone to hangout with 
-I’m a virgin and also I’ve never dated anyone but I just never saw the point in trying because no one takes me seriously. Many people have said I’m weird, annoying, don’t give a shit about anything, asked can I just be normal.

-I’ve started to realize when I got ADHD medication for the first time in my live at the age of 19 that all these hurtful things people were saying were true. And I only realized it because when I took the medicine I just didn’t have the urge to act like a “class clown” or impulsively make stupid to comments whenever there wasn’t something exciting happening. 
-But now even with taking medicine for over two years and I’m not acting as impulsive I still feel as if everyone thinks the same shit about me from a year and a half ago and I am so ready to give up. 
-I’ve tried so hard with making friends and I feel like I just can’t win because I don’t have a likable personality, I’ve gone to multiple roommates and never have I been close with any of my roommates like most people are with their roommates, and other than spending time with people that could be potentially my friends I can’t really find money things that make me happy. 
-I wake up every day and it’s just one big repetitive motion of going to class eating food going to more classes trying to study asking people if they want to hang out only for them to say the have plans with someone else and then it just repeats over and over 
- The only activity I found this year that makes me semi-happy is going to shitty parties and getting drunk with random people because no matter how you act everybody just blows it off as you being drunk and they’re drunk too so they don’t give a shit about anything

-I just wish I could understand how people are so happy and successful in life because my whole life feels like a failure and it seems like the feeling is true when other people don’t even want to be around me"

But now i don’t have no doctors cause Medicare and making to much money but not really because i can’t afford to pay for a healthcare plan. What are my options? I am trying to sanely make it though the day and not just off myself. I have no friends which seems to be another comment thread here. Just me, my art and my drugs.

192bsd6,Depression,2024-01-09,I Feel Like I'm Sabotaging My Own Friendships,"Hey all, I've been struggling with depression for the past 10 years and I've had my ups and downs but the past 2 months I've been really down. I just don't really care about life anymore and don't look forward to anything. I have a group of friends that care about me but I don't believe that they do and I keep doing things to sabotage myself and my friendships. 

This past weekend, I went camping with my friends and I hated every moment of it. I felt like I wasn't a part of the group and I just didn't participate in conversations or jokes. I was snapping at people and telling them to fuck off because they were aggrivating me. I said several times that I wanted to kill myself. I just feel like I ruined the vibe and made a fool of myself. 

I talked to one of my closest friends in the group today and he laid it out to me pretty straight. He basically said that I get too into my own head sometimes and I overthink how bad my life really is. To some degree he's right. My life isn't awful, I just graduated from uni with my masters and I'm going on a 2 week trip with the same group of friends in a few weeks time but I can't get it out of my head that my life is shit and I'm worth nothing.

Now I'm anxious that if I stay like this I'm going to lose my friends and it's making me feel even worse. I don't want people to think of me as this self loathing loser but that's all I think of myself as. I'm sick of feeling like this, but no matter what I do, I end up back in this same spot. I've been on different anti-depressants for years, I've seen psychologists (mine right now is really good but I'm starting to think I can't be helped anymore), and despite all of this my periods of happiness are blips compared to my long standing periods of depression and anxiety."

192bfol,Depression,2024-01-09,Is it normal that depression feels like being mentally paralyzed?,"Why can I plan to do something but if at the time I even just start slightly think of something depressive related to me, I’ll just not be motivated to do anything at all. I may have all the strength physically at the moment but I feel so weak minded that I can’t do anything. Like, if I was stuck or paralyzed. Is that normal behavior for a depressive person? The people around me (family) just view it as laziness. I could never have explained why I feel such way.

Have any of y’all ever had an episode where you’re suffering and grasping at the thought (literally holding your head) of making it all stop for good? Finally being freed of those thoughts. I sometimes feel that if I ever had a gun in my presence, I would’ve shot myself at any of my lowest moments and that there could still be a chance of it."
192b5lg,Depression,2024-01-09,Unmotivated,"I just constantly feel tired and unmotivated to do ANYTHING at all. I used to be so hardworking, passionate, goal-oriented and disciplined.

So obviously I start falling apart since I'm not putting much effort. But is being alive supposed to be this hard? How can I get out of this cycle? "
192asit,Depression,2024-01-09,Ex-flight attendant and I’ve shot myself in the foot.,"When I was growing up I always knew that I wanted to travel. I couldn’t stand the thought of “normalcy” the 8-5 Monday to Friday stuck in traffic for hours and repeat routine. 
I didn’t know how I’d achieve this life of travel but I’d figure it out at whatever cost. 
I ended up leaving my home country when I was 22 years old.
Fast forward 10 years later and I’ve traveled to more than 70 different countries and worked in aviation and now in the yachting industry. Sitting on an island in the Caribbean with sand between my toes and sunsets with sailboats on the horizon.
There’s just one thing
I can’t help but feel so terribly unfulfilled 
I wish sometimes that I never had these big dreams when I was a kid because maybe today I’d be happily married with the white picket fence and a fucking dog and a cat and have normal worries but not be chasing something more more more every single day.

I’ll never be happy with “normal” and I’m paying for it every single day. 

I don’t know if anyone relates to what I’m going through but I need you to know that I’m not ungrateful for the life I’ve lead, but more mourning the life I’ll never be able to have because I’ve exposed myself to places, people and experiences that will never allow me to be OK with a normal life.

When does the chasing end?"
192arik,Depression,2024-01-09,I lost my kindness,"I feel like I lost my heart, my kindness, my empathy, every part of me that had love and kindness has now filled with empty rage fueled by sadness. I lost who I am. I lost the light inside me that made me a person, that defined I had a soul. I never sold my soul but I let it slip away. Maybe I gave it piece by piece to everyone I've ever loved as they told me in each special way that I wasn't good enough.
They said it with their words sometimes, I know, but mostly with their actions. I refused to look in their eyes and recognize how they saw me but I watched as their respect for me dwindled and never grew. I gave more of my kindness and love just to beg that they see me and understand I have worth. As they continued to believe I had none I wondered how I could not believe the same.
For some time I thought I'd never want anyone to feel this way. I'd pour my knowledge of what others need to see in themselves out. The knowledge I could never give myself.
But that faded. It faded as I had something else grow.
Distain is all I have left. Disgust in the world and a need for revenge on those who have barely harmed me but enough was enough. I gave up on wanting to kill myself but I know that that may never really be true.
I don't know where I put my need to hate myself. I hate everyone else now. I think this will make me love myself but I hate myself more and hide it. I have no self control.
Honestly I never had any. I can't maintain my emotions and my mind wanders. I never can put a cap on what the limit is for a normal interaction is. What a real relationship can handle. I build my relationships high and strong, with obsession and false promises. But I build them strong knowing my chaos is always stronger. I know I can destroy it all and I always do. The sturdier I make these relationships, building them so they can withstand the weather knowing I live in a land of hurricanes where I am the wind and I am the fury. I pray that when I create the sun again it can shine bright enough to make all the flowers bloom. To then motivate myself and others to build up the land once again. But the sturdier I build foundations the harder they fall. Each time the hurricane passes the sun shines dimmer and dimmer. I'm afraid that light is gone. I lost it in my own madness and I can't bring myself to get the flowers to grow anymore. Nothing is growing but I'm still trying to destroy the world but there are no more structures left. I naturally want to have light.
It's always been my nature. I seak it out, I create it, look for it wherever I go. That need is still there but there's no ability and no resources to truly create it within me.
Instead of destroying relationships I've built, now I want to destroy people. People I want to love me but I just can't.
There's no true way to destroy them and I never truly want to so that anger just rages inside of me and pops out just enough for no one to want to step near me. I'm lost now.

I finished my studies but never liked it and wanted to just start over.

I’ve been for 2 months in Australia, no job, no friends, no money and no way to come back because I have no more money. Also, just the idea for coming back as a completely loser terrifies me, every day I look for a job and I get rejected for everything. Literally I wake up look for job 16 hours in different ways and sleep every fucking day since 2 months now.

I now this is not comparable with the things I used to read here from you guys, but I just wanted to let it out all. I felt miserable, and everyday that pass I feel worst.

I put to much pression on my self and now is something that I just can’t handle anymore."

Growing up my family is always pissed at me and takes out their anger out on me by shouting at me and it only worsened as I grew older I got called Useless,Worthless and other hurtful insults. It took a huge toll on me I'm seen by my friends and classmates as happy and talkative but when I get home I'm a depressed mess everyday when my dad sees me crying I should only cry when someone died   in the family. They make me feel like i didn't do anything right I got honors when I was in elementary and never once heard they were proud at me. It hurts so much to see them so nice to other kids when they can't even show love and support to their own son. Everyday I've been thinking of offing myself I can't  take it anymore I'm so stressed with everything school works and projects making it worse i don't have time for myself only school work school work school work i honestly want to end it all but I want to not hurt anyone that still loves me. When the class made a spoken poetry about anything I made it about my struggles only 2 people felt bad but the other 49 students didn't care. I just wanna disappear I feel like I'm never enough for anyone I'm just a stupid piece of shit that will never be loved and will end up a failure so why not kill myself?"

I hate my voice I just try to not talk. I'm not used to taking so it's hard but I just hate hearing myself. I hate my weight I'm very underweight and that means I'm smaller height than I should be. I don't work out, I don't do skincare to get rid of pimples my face is covered with. I just don't. It's my fault I know. I hate myself so much I don't think I deserve things and I don't.

Not the people i refer to as “friends” and maybe not even my relatives bc i was never close to my extended family. The only people who would miss me are maybe my parents, but one day when they are gone, who will miss me? My “friends” dont seem to miss me because im always the one reaching out, if i didnt reach out first we wouldve stopped talking ages ago. Sometimes they dont event respond when i text them. I feel insignificant like a faceless background character in a novel. I’m so lonely and i’ve tried so hard to connect with people but it always feels one-sided.   I wanna know what it feels like to know someone cares enough about you to miss you and reach out to you first.

1929rja,Depression,2024-01-09,Being Ugly is Awful,"I can't take this anymore. None of my problems would exist if I wasn't ugly. Being ugly caused me to be bullied, which ruins my self esteem to this day. Being ugly makes it near impossible to make friends or have any of the experiences I see all my friends having and so desperately want (Boyfriends, male attention, etc...) Being ugly made me hate myself and get an eating disorder so now all I can think of, even in 'recovery', is food, how much I'm eating, how disgusting it's making me, how large my thighs are...

I hate being ugly most of all because it's all I can think of, and I can't change it. No matter how many treatments I do, my rosacea makes my skin peel off, swell, and turn red. I can't diet because right now I'm working on getting my eating back to normal so I don't go into seizures on the toilet again like last time. All the other things about me are pretty good. Except for one fatal flaw; something I can't and won't improve:

I can't exercise. Between my knees which have little to no cartilage left and pop extremely painfully when I walk, to the chronic asthma that causes me to pass out from lack of oxygen after a couple minutes of running, to the absolute hatred I've had for exercise since i was a little kid, to the extreme pain and fatigue that follows after it, I just hate it. No amount of convincing of its positive habits will make me. I'm already well aware, and I think about it every day. I just...can't.

To add to the list of things, none of the previous problems are treatable because despite having gotten every blood panel, comprehensive scan, and examination possible, the only conclusion I've received is that it will either go away with time or its psychosomatic. 

All in all, the only thing I think about every day is how disgusting my body and face looks, how people treat me, how miserable I am, how little discipline I have (I don't often keep up with schoolwork because of pain, depression, and laziness combo), and how everything is wrong with the world. Despite my numerous attempts to change and become a better and more positive, nice, disciplined, caring, less bitter person, I always end up with yet another friend leaving me because I'm too rude and unfun to be around. I feel miserable anytime I see someone's achievements, I want to hang myself when I see inspiration posters, and I gag when I look at success stories. I've been depressed for so long, I've become an untreatably depressed person.

Which brings me to my final question. What the hell do I do? I've heard ""It gets better."" It's been 4 years. I'm still miserable. I'm on antidepressants that have caused a significant improvement in my mood yet I still feel like this. My family doesn't have the time or means of transportation for therapy, and, to be honest, I don't want to try again. 

So, anyone got ideas? I'm sorta on my last straw here."

The portion that gave the most marks, barely touched and time was up. I was supposed to ace that subject, like usual. It was the only one I'm good at, my only value to my group of friends who are geniuses.

20 marks. 20 marks out of 60 marks just went down the drain. Why am I still alive? I have no value, no purpose so what the fuck am I still doing here?

All of my attempts failed. Why? Why won't God just let me die? Why do I have to think about my family at the last minute before hanging myself? Why did I get stopped by my classmates from jumping down the school building?

1928o40,Depression,2024-01-09,My story isn't unique but I still feel alone.,"Since I was in middle school (now 35) I have always wondered when my time would come. Not that I had a fear of dying or anything, it was more of the fact that I couldn't wait. I had multiple attempts at suicide when I was younger, but it never went my way as if something or someone was always stopping me. Like the universe keeps telling me it isn't time yet. Honestly makes me feel like I had no control over my life and death.

I see people around me passing at all various ages. The most recent was my younger sister. The life she chose was full of struggles and she was the main cause of it. She couldn't see all the people that loved her and always chose to make poor decision that eventually brought her story to a close.

Selfishly, a part of me wished that I was the one to have died and not her. My family would have wished the same...I don't talk to them much as I am the white sheep of the family. We don't see eye to eye and part of my depression stemmed from their abuse of neglect. Out of 7 children, I was the only one treated poorly. We all had the same parents, grew up in the same household, but for some reason I was the punching bag for both my parents. Straight A student, quiet and shy...so why me?

I can't say that my life is bad. I work hard, pay bills on time, my jobs are flexible and I get paid well. I am married to a wonderful man who had his fair share of misfortune in life. He had always told me that I saved him. I can't imagine leaving him alone in the world but I still envy those who have already left it.

Am I strange? There has to be something wrong with me...right?

 people seemingly move on so easily and I just feel so stuck. Part of me is so jealous and at this point I feel like an empty shell.

1928ign,Depression,2024-01-09,Should I take medz again?,"Currently NEET. Been so depressed and anxious over trying to get back in the workforce, but am so scared because of previous workplaces being toxic. I’ve even had coworkers and customers size me up and try to physically intimidate me. So i quit even without a two-weeks notice. I’ve developed more of a backbone and will retaliate physical force because I’m tired of being pushed around. I just want to stop being unemployed and earn a living for myself in hopes to go to a bootcamp or school to become a software engineer.

I’ve developed better coping habits (don’t do drugs or drink till I get drunk anymore) like gym, exercise, studying for a skill I like, dieting, and NoFap. 

I used to take medz in the past like fluoexitine, gabapentin, Wellbutrin.  They didn’t really work and made me fat. I’m in a much better physical shape and don’t do recreational drugs anymore, but the idea of taking medications again scare me because I don’t want to hinder my current health. This was years ago. 

Should I take medz again?"
1928gco,Depression,2024-01-09,I'm scared of *that* feeling,"I'm really scared about this feeling, It's like a hole in my chest that I can't fill up, like a black hole, it feels like no matter what I throw at it it'll never fill up, like it's bottomless, what if it never goes away?

what if it's like this forever? I don't want to live with this hole on my chest, I don't want to feel unhappy forever, I don't want to live my life chasing happiness and never achieving it, I get overwhelmed just thinking about it. What if I'm just not made to be happy? Not all people are happy, what if I'm one more, like it's something I'm banned from achieving.

I think I just hate feelings in general, happiness? I appreciate it but it will go away, eventually;
angriness? nothing matters anymore so why get upset; sadness? it'll last forever, better get comfortable with it.

But with this feeling is different, it's hard to explain but it feels like everything, like I can feel every emotion, sensation, all at once, I can feel my heart beating, my lungs expanding, the blood rushing to my head, my hands gripping my head, I can hear the music, the fan, the street noise, the people talking outside, the dogs; I feel desperate, sad, confused, helpless, angry, stressed.

it's so overwhelming, and it's so unexpected too, it just happened to me while I was watching a TV show with a friend, that's not the time and place for that kind of stuff, I'm supposed to be happy, I'm supposed to be safe there? then why did that happen right there and then? that's not how it should be, that's not fair. 

I'm scared of what this feeling can do to me, what if it is the end? the final stage of my depression, is this what's going to make me kill myself? all it takes is one bad day and this feeling and I could legit end it all out of pure desperation for it to stop.

I'm so tired, I want to go to sleep in a cabin, in the middle of a circle of green grass surrounded by forest, wake up when all of this goes away, even if I have to sleep for 100 years straight, whatever to get away from this feeling."

I was being carried by a friend who tripped and slammed me into the ground. Since then the doctor has ordered me to be non weight bearing on my right leg for 3 months. Then I will start trying to walk normally again. For now I use a walker to hop on my left foot when needed. Despite getting a lot better in the past week I still feel like I’ve lost so much. Going to the bathroom and showering are such difficult tasks. I can no longer live in my one bedroom apartment by myself in a new city. I can’t even drive. I know that these are all things I will eventually get to do again but I can’t help be very frustrated that I have to halt so much of my life that I feel had barely started. I had just moved to a new city six months ago and started a new job. I feel like now I’m losing so much time and I also just don’t feel like myself and I’m not sure why. Logically I know it’s just a few months and I’ll be back to normal hopefully but for some reason I feel very off and I can’t quite figure out why.

I spent time studying and preparing but it's gotten me nowhere. I graduated about 2 years ago and now going for 3 soon. I worked for IT, a warehouse, and made a website for free after I graduated. Now I'm one month unemployed and I feel like I accomplished nothing in all this time. It might be my fault since I stopped searching for a job and got comfortable at the jobs I took after.

 I lost my friends and my last job hurt me more mentally than anything else. I'm trying to push more into studying getting certifications and developing projects. I feel like it won't help me at all and that maybe I wasn't cut out for anything. I just feel like I wasted my life at school and these last 2 years. Everyone I used to know has a great job but I don't have one. Now I feel like no one wants to hire me and I should have just stayed at a warehouse for the rest of my life.

Sometimes I wish I could just disappear or get a do-over in life. I think life would have been better without me around.

The self hatred the misery all of it. Now first year of uni still as miserable. The medication and being away from them helps but not enough. I only took 1.5 credits to go easier on myself and failed 2 of them because I’m struggling a lot mentally. I’ve lost so much weight and I’m stressed. If I could magically be better right now I could make a comeback but that’s the problem I’m not better I’m im only getting worse. Because I’ve been considered smart for a long time I feel embarrassed though. Can’t feel emotions normally but embarrassment and shame still works thanks brain. The plan was to be a doctor that was an easy achievable life dream. Now I can’t even care enough to get myself out of bed some days. 

At a young age I was considered to be somewhat gifted academically. I had low to high 90’s in every class from Gr.1 to Gr.9.

Gr.10 with quarantine I started becoming depressed. I didn’t know that’s what it was then but it definitely was. In black families hitting your kids is pretty normal but I no longer has any emotional escape. No clubs no over-involving myself in school. I still remember the exact day I started losing myself my brother kept hitting her chair against the table lightly and it got super loud it was like the sound was crushing my mind. I got to a point where I isolated myself for 4 months in the basement so I didn’t have to talk to anyone because I couldn’t handle crying everyday but that wasn’t bad.

Then cue the numbness I stopped caring about things slowly. My first late assignment my first class missed my first assignment I didn’t hand in ect. I got a 54% in math which was the worse grade I’ve had in my life. I redid it in the summer and got a 94% but the problem remained. I stopped caring about external validation internal validation. The very hunger that fuelled me my entire life was just gone.

The year after when things were back in person I wasn’t the same. I was constantly anxious sounds movements irritated and scared me. Didn’t help that they hit and threatened me a lot. I started off pretty strong with a high 90’s average but then something changed and got worse again. By the end of the year I had dropped a lot. From that summer things rapidly declined. I was miserable for no apparent reason. I decided to get my first job to keep my mind occupied but it didn’t help.

 My final year of high school started and usually at the beginning of the year I feel refreshed but that was the first time I started a school year burned out. I scraped by to do anything eat sleep take care of myself forget school. That year was the first and only time I self harmed. I had to get on antidepressants because I couldn’t stop crying everyday for reasons I couldn’t pin point. I went through phases of just wanted to be numb but realizing that hurt too and the being constantly miserable and wanting to be numb again. Still I was able to wing it and still got into the program I wanted for uni whatever.

Is there any coming back from this be honest. I am diagnosed with severe depression and generalized anxiety disorder and the medication helps the anxiety be gone which thank God. But the depression nope. I could still somewhat function with anxiety but depression makes me have no will to do anything. Without my medication I’m not even a human being. 

I’m numb all the time and when I’m not everything hurts. The weight of all I’ve done hits. I don’t even know who I am anymore."
1927h2m,Depression,2024-01-09,I just need some advice,"So I am 30 year old male. I’ve just hit a very depressing point in my life where I realize that I’m not responsible at all. Even I myself would tell you I think like a 21 year old. I have no sense of responsibility or just never been successful in a way. I lived most of my adult life from 21-28 with my ex bf where honestly I did like him, but not sure if it was just a situation ship  where I felt comfortable and was young &amp; lived with him. Anyways what I’m trying to say is what can I do to be more responsible, I want to try. It’s sad for myself to think that I can’t get my own shit together at times. I’m happy that I can realize it, but the action part is what I lack. I’m obviously now broken up with the ex, have no place and no money. Finally the question: Is there anyone who’s ever felt there literally doomed with just not being  normal living person? Idk I gets so overwhelmed with things I let it pile up. Has anyone ever been so irresponsible and work there way up I wanna hear what you did? Some advice please."
1927f3j,Depression,2024-01-09,My life is just a loop,"Me (16M) ,My parents are seperated and i have to be at my moms house because my school is 5 mins away, nothing has changed, the only fun thing in my life is when i went to singapore with my family , after that now that im home i just feel empty, its been like this for a year now, school just feels like the same cycle over and over it's really taking away all my energy, i've tried everything to lose this feeling but somehow it keeps coming back, never done therapy, been in my moms house for like 2 years now and it is draining, nothing changes in this household, everytime i go to school nothing changes except the tests , i failed 2 years already and i want to change it, i really feel like im at the lowest point of my life ever, i havent had this suicidal feeling for months but it just found a way to come back, im improving my grades but all i feel is this empty void feeling, i dont have any failing marks anymore, but everywhere i go i feel empty, even when im with a big group of friends, i still feel empty, this sadness is really draining my life for the past 2 years."
1927cjp,Depression,2024-01-09,I’m lost,My entire life I’ve build has been crumbling beneath me for years and it’s too late to fix it. I don’t know what to do or where to go for help. I can’t reach out to anyone I know tbh. I lost and alone
192794y,Depression,2024-01-09,Every time I try and get help I give up,"I need help. I am 23, and Ive been through a lot. Ive tried finding a therapist, but everywhere is booked out for months, and when I go online they try to charge me a ridiculous amount like $80 a week and I cant afford that. I dont know what to do from here, as my depression is literally ruining my life and Im so young with so much potential to be great and the worst part is I am extremely aware of what Im doing to myself but I am STUCK. I have absolutely no motivation to do anything. I have a full time job that I love, and Im still forcing myself to be there and get through the day. When Im not working, Im either sitting around doing nothing or sleeping. I used to be an athlete, until I got sick with a blood disorder in high school, and then cancer a few years later. I am better now, but Im very unhealthy. I dont eat right, most of the time at all. Im not interested in food most of the time. I like to drink too much, and I have an addictive personality. I need help before I get to the point that I dont want help anymore. I just feel like a complete let down to myself and my family. I feel like I could be somebody great, but I am a failure because I cant get myself to do anything. I feel so Ill. I constantly think and worry about my life but do nothing to make it better. Can anybody give me some help or some tips. A cheap online therapist that really helps you, things I can do to motivate myself? I am so lost."
19272od,Depression,2024-01-09,What’s the point,"Really struggling with doing anything but the bare minimum right now. Going to my mundane job that just lets me scrape by. I just cannot muster any drive to do anything bigger with my life. All I think about is “what’s the point”. I just do not care about anything. A general feeling of numbness.

 Can anyone else relate/ does anyone have advice?"
1927127,Depression,2024-01-09,Life got better for me and I still hate it. What now?,"I guess nothing makes me happy. The thought of waking up every day for the rest of my life sounds exhausting. I use to enjoy painting, I use to be excited about being in college, little things like buying a new outfit or being proud of something I painted would bring me joy, but now nothing is worth doing. I hate living. I hate people and their apathy, i hate the news, I hate conversations and I really hate men. Im no longer living in an abusive household and It straight up doesn't matter. My relationship with my cat, my sister- its all pointless and adds nothing to my life other than unwanted commitment. I cant even comprehend living until im 20, i hate this simulation. My words aren't beautiful, and this life is ugly. What the fuck do I do now, there is nothing worth doing when everything and everyone is awful. FUCK YOU FUCK UOU FUCKYOU"
1926w1w,Depression,2024-01-09,So fucking done...,"A little backstory is i was with this girl a year and a half. When we got together she was the one i wanted since high school and i was like OMG THIS IS MY CHANCE!! First couple weeks were some of the best in my life. Then i started learning her past. With her exes, flings, slutty nature whatever. Fast forward 5 months and im a raging alcoholic because im taking care of her kids and the apartment while she ignores them and makes slutty tiktoks. She cheated on my 5 months in with the very person that was there when i attempted suicide that night. (No longer friends with him from that point forward). I get back with her about a week later and its just amazing for the bext few weeks then it went down hill. I wasnt drinking so heavy at this point but we were going to attempt a poly relationship, it didnt pan out because the girl wanted me and not her too. Broke up a little while after all that ordeal because she wanted to be single (her words not mine). She realized her mistake a few days later and came crawling back and apologizing and telling me things will be different i promise. I took her back. Things were good for a few weeks then it deteriated a lot but not as much as it did before. We got our own place together, i got a new car for our family, she finally got pregnant and i thought life couldnt get better. Then things got really really bad once she started having a hemorage (baby is still ok and set to be born end of feb). Constant fighting and strain and she was going back to how things used to be of her being a huge slob. I got sick of it and started getting mad. Mind you i still helped her every night even after working 11 hours (i worked 11 hours a day 3 days a week). Fast forward to just a week and a half ago and for legal reasons i am unable to talk about what happened right now. Just know it wasnt good what had happened. I was thrown in jail on the 31st and got released on bail on the 2nd. Now i have no love of my life, no kids that i loved to death and raised, no home, no job, and no way to resolve anything due to having a no contact order and its fucking killing me on the inside more than fucking anything. Obviously you got the summary of that last year and a half and there was waaaay more going on both on my side and her side doing both good and bad. But i just want to be done in this world after getting my entire life stripped away from me and my heart and soul fucking SHATTERED beyond repair as well as possibly never seeing my god damn kid i wanted so badly with her 😭😭😭 im loosing stregth every day and dont know how much longer i can fight these demons before i let them win..."
1926vyg,Depression,2024-01-09,"In short – Easy life but want to kill myself right now. Trigger comes from family, mainly my father. Want advice and to vent a bit.","Not the US or Europe.

  
I have a very good life by most accounts. I live in a third world country but, wealthy family, went to college in the US, so should not have any serious money problems basically ever.

  
A bit of childhood/adolescent trauma I think. My father has a VERY dominant personality and is very imposing physically. Basically everyone says he is “scary”, employees are “afraid” of him and similar, though now he has mellowed out quite a bit.

  
When I was little, I lived a very sheltered life (dangerous country, kidnappings, murders, etc). Also, from what I remember, my father tended to yell and be fairly “aggressive” . There was some spanking when little but nothing beyond that, zero physical abuse, also no marital abuse, you could say he is “scared” of my mom. I think this left me with some self-esteem problems, and the need to please others. I used to get extremely anxious if I felt I was disliked by someone, I have gotten a little better now.  

  
Ignoring the whole family business dynamic (my father sent me to another country to open a business while I had no experience so I could learn, which is a great opportunity and I am grateful, but was also really hard and stressful.

  
My problem is basically feeling I am not enough from those close to me. During the holidays we have been staying at my parents. My parents, my SO, my little brother and I usually chat a lot. In most of our after meal chats they would say one or two comments about some of my defects and things I do wrong. This slowly chipped my confidence and I ended up mentioning it to my SO, who has been really supportive since then. Hearing about your weaknesses every day with no positive comment really hurts your confidence. 

  
January 1st was the breaking point for me, we were organizing the house for a visit and I forgot my wallet on the entryway table. I was inside the guest restroom when I heard my father say to my mother something to the effect of “he is a disaster leaving all his shit laying around”. I don’t remember exactly what he said, and it wasn’t anything important really, but since then I have been a complete mess.

  
I think he says it because he wants me to be better, and I am sure he loves me. But I just feel I am a complete failure. I have always worked extremely hard, good grades in school, great grades in college, prizes, etc, I give 100% to the family business. But I think I have barely received any congratulations from my parents. I know I have defects, basically in self-doubt, but every comment I remember is something about what I am doing wrong. I have these relapses every few years, but this is definitely the worst.

  
To add a cherry on top, today he just said he is not sure I can take care of the business at home, mind you I am in my late 20s.

  
I know I am extremely lucky, but I am just tired of feeling this way, I am thinking about suicide more as an escape than anything else.

And also I feel I have dedicated almost the last decade of my life to the family business. If I fail at this I really don’t know what I want to do with my life. I feel like I would be such a disappointment that I think I prefer killing myself than dealing with it.  I really want to be good enough and I want to work achieve it, but I feel empty and weak right now.

  
I am looking for a therapist and I want to get better, but I am feeling a bit hopeless at the moment.  


Thank you whoever reads this. I know I have it good, and that I should be happy. I am grateful for everything my parents have done for me and for how lucky I am.

1926u53,Depression,2024-01-09,I'm having a really hard time,"My significant other has bpd and I am finding it very very hard to navigate in our relationship. It's taking a great toll on my mental health. I love her but I don't know what to do anymore..

It's like I'm always feeling unheard, not validated, and everything else."
1926rv8,Depression,2024-01-09,Need to talk to someone,I’m so depressed and lonely. I can barely make myself work or do anything lately. Sometimes happened recently which has made me feel even worse. I’m so tired of suffering. I wish I had someone to talk to
1926lyd,Depression,2024-01-09,What is the depression pain in chest?,"I read through some other post’s talking about the feeling but none explained what’s happening physically. For me it’s a dull ache behind my sternum that radiates outward like a water drop. It’s almost like an extremely weak geyser. It wells up and out and is gone in less than a second. In my head I picture it travelling like electricity does across a wooden plank if youve ever seen those art things. It's just so quick. It happens mainly when I’m self deprecating and accepting hard truths/  hurting my feelings.

It happens as soon as I comprehend the sentence I’m saying or thought to myself. i.e. (I'm unlovable', 'A basket case', 'There's no hope for me', or 'I'll be alone forever')

Stuff like that.

I'm almost 23 and I've always had this feeling when I have a depressive episode/moment, so it's not new. But I may or may not have had a medicinally induced mild heart attack a few months ago. I don't think it was serious I was more annoyed than anything else. But anyway, given that the sensation is not constant and pops up which each, I guess stab to the heart? I would like to know what's going on internally just to be sure. Even when I'm not sad, dysphoria can illicit a similar but not necessarily painful response.

So if anybody knows, I'd appreciate it. Cause physical muscle spasms due to sadness sounds unhealthy."
1926g8y,Depression,2024-01-09,Romantically lonely,I am gay and I normally feel lonely but something lately has just made me want a boyfriend so much more than normal. I recently turned 20 and college classes are starting soon but how can I study when all I can think about is cuddling. Guys are so pretty and handsome and they can be so sweet ATP I feel like a child that's praying to skydaddy for a puppy. So tldr lonely gay and can't focus because a boyfriend is a need SOS
1925ymd,Depression,2024-01-09,Feeling hopeless because I don't want anything anymore,"A naive part of me still has hope of figuring myself out and pulling my life together. But I just can't seem to find the motivation or drive to actually want or enjoy anything. I have no job, no friends that actually talk to me, no relationship, no hobbies. I hate everything about myself and my life right now. I spend every day just filling the time until I can sleep with things that distract me but that I don't actually enjoy, and I know I need to change that to feel less depressed. But it all just feels so distant, and I can't bring myself to want to have any of the things I mentioned. I'm really starting to lose hope that I can change. I'm not even really sure if I want to feel better or see change at all. I'm just stagnant and numb.

The only response I've seen to thoughts like this is the advice to focus on little things in life that you enjoy and to make that your meaning. And yes, there are tiny things that bring me happiness, like a pretty sunset or a nice meal. But even that happiness is still clouded with guilt and unease. Also, they aren't things that can translate to larger meaning or fulfillment in my life, or that motivate me to change what I'm doing with my time. They're far outnumbered by things that make me miserable. And trying to focus on it in the mentality of thinking that maybe that little bit of joy is enough to keep going just gives me the excuse to continue fester in the nothingness of my day-to-day life, which has made me feel worse. 

Can anyone relate? idk, I feel a little alone in this and I'm just wondering if anyone else is struggling with wanting to want something"

This past month is the lowest I have weighed in about 2 years. I weighed myself earlier and balled my eyes out. The person I see in the mirror is not me anymore. I weighed in at 102 FUCKING LBS. 102 POUNDS. My anxiety is through the roof now due to the way I look which has increased my already existing depression ten fold. It does not help that I isolate myself from my friends and family, I have not left my room in a month. My girlfriend dumped me which sent me spiraling into a deep dark depression to where I would practically starve myself because I just did not find even the little bare necessities like eating or studying to be tolerable anymore. Ive lost about 12 lbs in 2 weeks and i look DISGUSTING. My friends try to force me to eat and I try I really do, but I feel nauseous and sick everytime I try to eat even above 1000 cals. I lost the motivation to be eating more and havnt set foot in a gym since she left me, 2 months ago. Im tired of this and want to be better and treat myself better so I want to get back in the gym. I look like walking skin and bones. What I am looking for is for some advice in what types of food I should be eating and some beginner workout splits for really skinny guys. Any help or advice would be appreciated. My body dysmorphia right now is at an all time high. I hate the way I look, my confidence has dropped insanely low I dont even bother trying to talk to girls or even new guy friends anymore because I just hate how I look now. I have been bed rotting for a solid month. Someone please advise me on steps I should take to take control back of my body and to feel confident in my own skin. Thank you."

To achieve this chemically induced happiness, while still always knowing, in the back of my mind, how shitty the world really is? And that's never going to change. Even if the medication does work, what heppens when it stops working. My doctor has increased my dosage of Wellbutrin over the last 2 and a half years to 400mg/ day. Even then it will just buy me what? Another 6 months - 1 year of happiness? Then what? Im approaching the maximum dose of 475mg a day. After that I don't know what I'll do. I've tried so many medications and Wellbutrin is the only one that made any noticeable difference to me. At lease the upside is that taking all this medication surely will shorten my lifespan. I'm 27 years old and on 5 different medications 2 of which are controlled substances to which I have surely become dependent on."

19252lm,Depression,2024-01-09,My brother walked in on me crying,"Last night I was getting ready for bed and my brother (10yo) was in my room. After I laid down, he left the room but did his usual antics of sneaking in and trying to scare me. Eventually I really thought he was done so I put some music in my AirPods and started crying. I had been holding back all day for an array of reasons, which I guess I’m willing to talk about if anyone asks. Then he walked in, I didn’t hear nor see him because I had music blasting in my ears and my head was in my hands. He turned on my lights and could see that I was awake by my motions of crying. He walked up to me trying to figure out what I was doing and eventually said “Are you crying?” I said no, but it was obvious that I was and he knew it. We ended up doing something for a bit because I decided I needed the company and something to get my mind off of things. He kept pestering me about what I was crying about asking questions like “did someone die?” or “does someone have cancer” to which i told him no and said it was only something with me, to which he responded “are you going to die? Do you have cancer?” I assume he was just trying to make me laugh but it wasn’t exactly working. I’m worried that he’s going to tell my parents and then I’m screwed. I don’t like talking to people about it unless I don’t know them and it’s online. I’m at loss for what to do. I don’t really even need any suggestions I just wanted to get this off my chest and see if this has happened to anyone else."

To care and love for all our fellow man equally. There would be no pain, no hurt, if we all looked out for one another. Everyone would get a meal, a home, everyone would be safe. This world is so terrifying, so so scary. Once my parents leave this world there will be no one to love me, or make sure I’m ok. And I really need a lot of help, I need a lot of support. I know I sound pathetic. I’m not strong enough to stand on my own right now, hopefully I won’t be like this forever. I wish I was tougher, I wish I wasn’t so afraid and sad about everything.

1924ne2,Depression,2024-01-09,My emotions are gone,"Hello, this isn’t my first time. But I’ve got a little bit. After several months of being alone, I’ve come to term with the fact. However in my depressive state I’ve contracted HSV-2. I’ve been avoiding any type of contacts with friends, girls, and most of my family. I’m only in contact with immediate family. 
My mood was improving before I found out. But when I found out. I felt as if my whole around me came crashing down. So many types of thoughts were running through my head at 1,000mph. Then all at once, all my emotions just gone… if my trust issues wasn’t bad before, it just gotten worse. I can’t find any reasons to be happy or sad or angry. All the things I found funny or made me happy stop. So did the rest. I even spent days trying to cry, but just can’t. 
I don’t feel deserving of love, and can’t even imagine anyone loving me. I’m 24 years old and never experienced a heathy relationship. Some times I question if I’m the problem. I like to be alone as much as possible, because I don’t want people to see me or talk to me. I don’t even feel human anymore. I can only imagine what people see of me. A outcast, bad news, a monster, trash, or a phantom. 
My mind is completely detached from my emotions. All my pain were caused my own emotions and I realized that now. Maybe I’m better off alone, maybe that how it should be. Maybe love is bad for me"

Started losing a lot of money. 
I go to work 9-5 and then to the gym 6-8 and I’ve tried making friends there but people want to work out alone, I’ve gotten a few girls numbers but they barley respond and don’t even want to talk, my phone is dry 99.9% of the time. No one messages me. I go home after the gym alone in my room and just watch YouTube videos. And play games just to repeat it all tomorrow, my life feels hopeless, I have absolutely no one to hang out with. The feelings of my ex filled my void and I was happy she was my only friend. I hope somome sees this, I know life is a beautiful thing and suicide isn’t the answer. But it hurts to wake up everyday and go on loop"
1924j5q,Depression,2024-01-09,Is happiness a choice?,"Hi people of Reddit, I don’t know where to post this. I just need advice and to dump some stuff. Sorry if this is the wrong place. I don’t feel like I’m depressed, I’m just sad most the time. I feel I have minor depressive symptoms. 

I (M22) don’t really know how to be happy anymore. And it’s really starting to eat at me.

I’d always been a “social butterfly” my whole life, never really struggled making friends or conversation, never had any “bad” thoughts. 

Since 2022 I’ve been sad.

2022 was the worst year of my life and I’ve never really recovered since. 

My first love (of 2 years) had broken up with me. We were trying long distance as she had just gone to university in another country. She just stopped communicating with me, I pretty much had to get it out of her. That really got me sad, she was my person, to this day she knows more about me than anyone else. I started to get better a couple months after. Working out, getting back out there, I was recovering I guess. (She’s still apart of my main friend group, I still see her from time to time, though I’m invisible pretty much.)

5 months after the breakup (it was in February), literally the morning of my ex’s birthday (can’t make this shit up), I drunkenly witnessed my friend jump in front of a train to commit suicide. A couple hours prior we were at a local music festival, having a great time drinking and laughing. My last picture with him was at that festival, arm in arm. 

We had all left our own way, I had walked to the closest train station, alone, to find a way home (I was quite drunk). 

My friend in question had been dropped off at home by another mutual friend, written a letter, stolen his mum’s car and coincidentally gone at the same station I was headed to. Around 6am he had jumped onto the tracks.

My older brother found me passed out on a bench at that station a couple hours later, he woke me up, and in shock I told him what I’d witnessed and described the corpse and blood etc… (call it being too drunk or trauma blockage, fortunately I don’t remember any these details/images)

I had no idea it was my friend until I’d woken up later and been told my another friend that evening.

That really fucked me up. I’d randomly start crying alone in the evenings, started listening to sad music, really getting immersed into my sad emotions. At 20 y.o. I’d already lost someone I’d grown up with.

At the time I was working, and in Jan of 2023 my job contract had expired, so I tried getting into university for a Computer Science Bachelors. 
I had all the grades, etc… but I was missing a higher level math qualification, so I started studying for that exam to get into my desired school. I failed. So I tried again, and failed again.
The whole of 2023 I spent pretty much at home trying to study for this exam. I’ve just sat it again and I’m waiting for the results.

Currently, I’ve noticed how I’ve completely changed. From being a smiley social butterfly, always happy to meet new people and feeling happy, to this hollow memory of what once was.

I’ll have friends ask me “are you okay?” Or “what’s wrong?” When hanging out. (I’ll be feeling normal)

My math tutor even told my mother “he has a deep sadness in his eyes”. I’ve never had such comments.

I’m constantly stuck in my head, overanalysing every social interaction I have, every thought. I think about death everyday for some reason, I don’t genuinely consider killing myself but I’ve thought about how people would react, what I’d give to who, etc… I’ll be driving or waiting for a train and just randomly think “I could kill myself if I wanted to right now”.

I can barely hold an interesting conversation with my friends anymore outside of small talk, it makes me feel absolutely boring and I’ve noticed the change it’s had on the way they look at me. I’ll be listening but I’m not really, I’m just in my thought thinking about how I should react to what’s being said, or what to say next. There’s no more natural flow to conversation and I can’t understand why I’m like this. I’ve lost all confidence to interject into conversations. I just “listen”.

I’ve gained some weight cuz I don’t do anything physical anymore, and I absolutely hate the way I look. I’ve started working out again for 2024 though, I’m hoping it can get me confidant again.

My sleep is awful, I’ll stay awake until 7am for no reason most nights. 
Besides going out for a smoke or seeing friends, I’m in my room 90% of the time.

I was smoking a cig the other week and I was trying to remember the last time I was happy. I really had to think about that, and I didn’t know. It kind of broke my heart in a weird way. I’ve forgotten what it’s like.

I’ve been abusing weed, I’m trying to get off of it, it’s been a couple days I haven’t smoked.

There will be the odd day where I’m feeling good, seeing friends, but it feels like an act. It doesn’t feel genuine. I noticed I’ll “laugh” out of habit now when talking, because it feels like that’s what I should be doing.

Sorry for this absolute unit of text, I’ll get to the point.

Am I choosing to be this way? 
Can I choose to be happy again? 
What can I do? 
Am I depressed?

I can’t stand being like this anymore. I’m scared I‘ll be “stuck” like this. I want to be happy again but I don’t know how, it feels like such a hurdle and it shouldn’t.

I don’t even know why I’m writing this but it feels nice to get all this shit off my chest. I don’t really talk to anyone about this.

Any advice on getting better? Getting out of my damn head and actually living again?

I feel like I have no valid reason to be this sad all the time.

Thanks for reading."
1924g6h,Depression,2024-01-09,I can't do it,"27 F moved to Canada a year ago. I've had GAD and MDD for a few years now, but coming here has made it worse. This past year was tough to say the least, and every month from November is getting progressively worse for me. I don't have focus. I have constant brain fog. I love to read but I can't. My eyes burn when I try to focus. I feel dread in my chest and a hurricane in my head. I feel out of my mind bored but numb while doing anything I used to love. 

Recently I wanted to complete my second entry nursing application and apply for a masters (deadline 1st February) but I'm not able to do that. It feels like my brain just isn't working. I wanted previously to start school this year, but even thinking about it feels hard and overwhelming.

My psychiatrist is hardly in the country, so I got a new one. His appointment is at the end of this month. I don't know how I'll survive till then. I skipped my period because of the stress, depression and uncontrollable crying.

I want to get help, a therapist, but they're so expensive. I don't know where to start. Even looking for one feels like there's no end i.e overwhelming 

And I miss my mom. So. Much.

I really want to believe things will get better, but it doesn't seem so. This country and it's processes are very overwhelming, and my brain just isn't cooperating, and I don't know what to do

I have thoughts of ending it all because living requires so much energy, which I no longer have. Also because I see no way out 😔😔

I have nothing to be happy about"
19249ar,Depression,2024-01-09,Depression is strange.,"I didn't have any problems with depression until I got on birth control about 4 years ago now. I started to notice a huge loss of motivation, and the feeling like there was a weighted blanket over all of my emotions. I told my doctor I felt like there's a rain cloud over my head all the time. He started me on Lexapro, which made me gain 60 pounds in 3 months, and then he switched me to cymbalta. Cymbalta has helped with the weight gain aspect, but some nights are still....hard. 

It feels exhausting to the point of near impossiblity to walk ""x"" amount of feet to my bathroom and brush my teeth. Wash my face. Take a shower. Get out of bed. 

I take a nap almost every single day, and my mom always fusses about it, but she doesn't know that on the hard days, sleep feels like the only peace I can get. Sometimes I take naps to purposely pass the time by. 

I never thought I would be in a place where basic hygiene would be so daunting, but here I am. Fighting every day. I don't want to die, I know that for sure, but damn.....I wish I just had some more peace."
19243mc,Depression,2024-01-09,Should I tell my therapists?,"I've been suffering from depression for about 12 years now. It got really bad a year ago and I went on long term disability leave. Lately my insurance provided therapists have been kind of pushing me to go back to work. I understand it's their job to help cure me and I really do want to get better. We agreed on a tentative Feb 5th gradual return to work. I arranged with my psychiatrist to have an appointment on Jan 15th for a final sort of check in to get clearance to return to work. 

Here's my dilemma: I've been really mentally trying to prepare myself for this return, I've been waking up early as if I'm going to work, been going to the gym to work out and build my brain muscle. But tonight I drove to Niagara Falls and picked out a spot where I'll commit suicide when I can't cope no longer. I've had this approximate spot picked out in my mind for quite some time but tonight I perfected it: there's a spot just beside the falls with a large cliff and a concrete floor some 30 meters below. I broke down and cried while I was there asking God for strength to carry on. I prayed but I also complained to God that he gave me a bit too much to handle: a failed marriage, a demanding father, schizoaffective disorder and borderline poverty. 

Tomorrow I check in with my insurance company's therapists prior to my appointment with my psychiatrist for work clearance. 

I don't want to seem weak. I want to work but I'm afraid after being off for so long I won't have the competence necessary to succeed and might just end up killing myself when the stress of work demands becomes too unbearable. 

I've been to hospital in inpatient psychiatry several times during my long term disability for depression. My last hospitalization was in October. 

Should I tell them (occupational therapist and psychotherapist) about my trip to Niagara Falls and picking out a suicide spot or should I just suck it up and tell them I'm fine?"

1923who,Depression,2024-01-09,Am I lazy or am I depressed?,"Hi everyone, obv reddit ain't the place to diagnose but I'm just curious. 

I just turned 24 a few months back, and I started my first job around 4 months back. My job is pretty stressful and with crazy targets, but I love the field and I wanna learn more.

Over the last month, I don't feel like doing anything. Nothing. I don't feel like getting up from bed at all, spend most of my time in it. I do meet my friends kinda on a daily basis. 

I've always had a great social life but nowadays it's just feels like I'm just there for the sake of it. I used to laugh and fool around alottt, now it feels like I'm trynna be that way.

I spend most of my time just lying in bed,.doing nothing. I regret it everyday and say to myself, I'll get up and go for work tomorrow, but I end up not doing anything and I feel bad. 

I don't get up from bad and I am too lazy to have breakfast. I skip meals alot. I dropped around 10kgs in 4 months because of this.

I just lie in the bed thinking that I will get it done tomorrow only to screw it up again.

I used to be extremely active ( I love sports) but I don't feel like working out anymore. I did workout a few weeks back and it felt so good. But now I just can't do it idk why. I just lie in my bed.

I don't know why I'm not doing anything. I just don't. I'm not going to work, I'm skipping meals, I don't research anything about my work, I don't workout, I feel like I'm going out for the sake of it( I regret it the moment I go out).

I'm just worried my parents will figure this out and they'll get too anxious. I don't want them to feel bad about this.

What to do? I've never felt like this before so I have no idea. 

Thanks for listening!"

I’ve even tried doing things I wouldn’t normally do just to fit in but I always go home with no one to talk too. It’s kinda exhausting almost. I’m quiet on my way to work, quiet at work and quiet when I go home. I just wonder why people won’t befriend me. I wondered if it was me drawing people away so I changed my attitude and started doing things differently but nothing seems to work."
1923h1b,Depression,2024-01-09,Relapsing,"I’ve had a history of attempted suicide after a long bout with depression, from late teens to my early 20’s.

I met my current partner when I was 23, she turned my life around. I trudged through life with her, improving our status bit by bit through the years…

I’m 29 now and I’ve started to feel really down again. I know the reasons why but, they look unsolvable unless things turn positive out of nowhere.

I’m stuck in a difficult position, I’m depressed and I’m just powering through. Thinking of all the new people in my life who care about me and love me.

But damn, all the thoughts that say things like it would be better if I just didn’t wake up anymore are getting louder and louder. 

I just want to shut out those thoughts, they aren’t helping. I’m trying to busy myself with whatever I can do to be productive. If I’m not working, I’m working on my hobbies. Anything to take my mind off the edge. 

Any tips on how to get back to normalcy?"

Not me I always had bad social anxiety. I always had low confidence in myself so I would never really walk to people. Even when I was a toddler my mom says that whenever she took me to the playground I'd always go away from the other kids. I have vivid memories of wandering through the playground during recess in elementary school watching everyone and wishing I could join in. Its been that way my entire life. And now im in sophmore year of hs and I've just become a fucking bitter person with no personality and I cant find anything I enjoy doing because I just want to lay in my bed and sleep because in my dreams I have real friends. Haven't been to anyones house since elementary school. I try to make friends but I can never rise above the level of person to just hang out with in school/lunch. And I cant kill myself because my fucking family will be sad. I wish they didnt give af about me so that I could but who knows im too much of a pussy to do anything really."

I rarely see any emotions on her, she never gets mad and I wish she did sometimes. She takes care of everything perfectly but I feel like she’s not truly happy. She doesn’t watch tv anymore, neither does she find what used to be entertaining amusing.  

I don’t know what to do, seeing her like that hurts me so much. She doesn’t have any friends to talk to, and it’s hard to strike a convo with her. I want her to be happy but I don’t know how. Everyday it feels like a cycle of yesterday, nothing ever changes. Sometimes I feel like we’re a burden to her, I know she loves us and I love her but she looks so tired all the time. I’m just so sad my home doesn’t feel like a home anymore, I’m grateful for everything my mom has done and I want to do something for her.

I watch the love-based relationships of my 18-19-year-old friends and they constantly tell me how happy they are. They tell me about my career and hobbies. They tell me to be happy by doing things like that. It's unfair to see everyone around me get what I want in life, except me. It has nothing to do with loneliness and not being happy.

1922fua,Depression,2024-01-09,Job hunting as a cripplingly depressed person.,"For context, I have major depressive disorder and complex PTSD, as well as substance abuse disorder (alcoholism). Recently went to rehab and have been alcohol-free since then. 

That being said, I’m also unemployed, and just the thought of applying to anything sends me into such paralyzing bouts of anxiety. Meanwhile, being unemployed makes me feel like a stagnant, non-contributing member of society, which welcomes me back to the bleak world of my depression. 

The only qualifications I have at the moment are customer service-related, and the idea of plastering on the “retail associate smile” makes me incredibly uncomfortable. My brain chemicals are still recovering from my substance abuse (self medication for other disorders), and I’m essentially learning how to navigate the world as a sober person with a debilitating mental illness. It’s just, a lot.

I also have a good bit of mental scars from past customer service jobs, which involved getting cursed at and crying in my car before every shift. I genuinely cannot handle that in this fragile state. 

Before anyone says getting a job will improve my mental health, I already know that; it’s just scary. And I fear that getting a miserable job is just going to trigger me, should that happen.

Pardon my pessimism, guys. To anyone else who’s going through this, you are not alone."

1921t10,Depression,2024-01-09,Slowly getting better,"I finally got back on antidepressants. It’s been so long since I had been off of them because I hated the way they made me feel. I felt numb in all the wrong ways, and I didn’t want to feel the side effects and have the medication change who I was. 

However, it had gotten to that point where I wasn’t even who I “was” anymore. That part of me was so gone and dead, there was nothing for me to lose anymore. 

My depression had gotten so bad and I didn’t want to cause harm to the person who loved me with all his heart. I waited and waited so long for the sadness to go away. I waited almost too long tbh. Five years to be exact. 

I just want to let anyone out there know that if you don’t want to go through the hardship of trying to find the antidepressant that’s right for you, you’re not alone. But someday, you will find something that works for you and everything will fall into place.

1920u8q,Depression,2024-01-09,Worried to start taking meds but also loss my job and barely leave bed,"I was prescribed meds for depression about three weeks ago. It’s waiting at the pharmacy and I can’t go get them because I’m nervous about it, I keep pushing it off. I have been in such a bad place mentally and I know they will help but I don’t want to start on meds I know it’s a path to dependency for the rest of my life. I am afraid of that life. I don’t really align with taking medicine I never have been big on them unless I’m really sick. And I guess in this case I am and I worry for all the stigmas I have around it. I wish I didn’t. I like all the spiritual practices but they aren’t enough and I sit at home a lot now barely able to take care of myself properly. So maybe meds are truly the right thing to help me. Thanks for reading my rant. Wishing for better days"
1920j7n,Depression,2024-01-09,Wanting to ghost everyone and leave social media forever,"Anybody else feel like a pent up feeling of exhaustion and even anger towards the dissatisfaction in relationships in their lives, the loneliness and lack of understanding from others that makes you feel like you don’t belong anywhere other than maybe just your family? I seriously hate my day to day life and my friends. I’ve tried fitting in but they’re all so stupid. And social media is so damn toxic it leads you down a road of worrying over stupid shit like appearance and other people’s success it frankly tires me the hell out. It’s just not for me.


I’ve had the fantasy of leaving behind my friends forever and ghosting them, it’s not that I don’t appreciate them in any way but I just don’t see our friendship leading anywhere. I’ve tried doing this to some extent but have always failed. I don’t know what to do.

After being depressed and heartbroken I’ve grown tired of trying to attract women or caring about dating at all, I just wanna leave forever. I sometimes fantasize about leaving to a forest and just lying in the woods alone and sleeping for 3 days straight so I can finally be at peace and cure myself.

I have dealt with so much pain related to heartbreak and being manipulated in relationships, of the goodness of my heart not being worth shit and only getting bitter and depressed as a result. The only ones that truly care about me are my family. They’re the only people I really love unconditionally. Other than that, I’ve had to stop believing in romantic love, trust and the minimum expectation of empathy coming from others. I’m just tired of being thrown around like a toy to reality, as if I were a test to see how much trauma and how numb someone can be.

I sometimes think about my death too, about what would happen if I died alone in say a murder or if I died to a terminal illness. Would people finally realize the suffering I’m going through or care to any extent? But I’ve come to realize I wouldn’t want it that way. I wouldn’t want anybody to know other than my family. In a hypothetical scenario, if I were to be diagnosed with a terminal illness, people would do a 180 on their attitude and be all empathetic and shit. But I don’t want their fucking pity. People’s authenticity isn’t shown in an extraordinary circumstance, it’s what they do everyday that shows their true colors. So yeah, I’m used to getting fake displays of love coming from love-interests, so I’m just done expecting anything or caring from others as well. And despite these doomer thoughts, depression, existential crisis, numbness and everything, I suck it all up. I’ve never tried playing the blackmail game, I’ve never tried manipulating, lying or exaggerating anything to anyone, I’ve never tried to get pity from friends, family or especially not the girls that broke my heart. I’ve been all stoic and shit. I’ve tried opening up to friends about the heartbreak I’ve been through but they’re insensitive as fuck and don’t understand anything, they say the meanest things sometimes. I know only my family understands. Whenever I’ve told my dad or mom at least they try to be empathetic and comprehensive. 


As much as depression is regarded as a mental illness, I think things like these can only be fully cured if you find your right place and what you love doing. It’s about looking for the right people and the right things. Environment can also be objectively bad. "
1920cmm,Depression,2024-01-09,Idek,"I don't know anymore,
he swears he loves me, and finds me attractive

he thinks I believe him that the girl in his emails wasn't him, he thinks that I believe him.
That the girl he hits notifications was a old person from his past
That the telegram wasn't his, that he doesn't have kik.
That he doesn't text other girls.

I came to realize I don't trust him. I feel nothing but overwhelming anexity, and I've started getting panic attacks its nothing but worrying.

He ask what's wrong I can't tell him that's its him.
I don't have the heart to. I can't bring myself to do it.
He will throw his phone at me but I'm not a idiot either he has separate accounts or he hides everything somewhere

He swears everyday that he loves me.
But idek I can't trust it.
I've never loved someone else like I do him.
or cared about. 
I fought so hard to get into this relationship and now I'm scared I fucked myself up.

I left him once the way he looked at me hurt behind words, I could only stay away for a day.
And it hurt more than anything being away from him.

So now I'm stuck in the cycle of always looking over his shoulder ik I would hurt my own feelings, Always feeling anexity and panic attacks. 
it's depressing but I love him.

I don’t remember which ones he talked about, but I know he said there’s a risk since it helps fix motivation before it fixes low mood or suicidal thoughts and I’m terrified that’s going to happen to me. I’m also irrationally scared I’m gonna put on weight because of them, I’m scared they’re not gonna work and I’m gonna just turn out to be unfixable or lazy.

I've been struggling to get better. I tried sales to improve my social anxiety. I work out to get more confident. I tried medications to better my life and skin.

But it always fails.

My sales skills got better, but my social life was still hopeless. I yoyo diet like 5 times now. My medication doesn't work or causes worse side effects.

Now unemployed and the job market is terrible.

I gave up on life 2 years ago. Not suicide, but shut in. I gain all the weight back, isolate myself, and watch YouTube and play video games to drown out my feelings. 

(I have not been suicidal, since my brother died, and I don't want to put my parents through that again.)

191yrtk,Depression,2024-01-08,"If this is best this ride gets, I want off now.","For context, I'm 34, overweight, gay, and forever single. I've lived on my own for years now and make enough money to pay the bills but never enough to not have to struggle if im not careful.

I used to weigh over 400lbs but managed to drop down to 230 over the course of 3 years while I was still living with my parents.

I've always considered myself a loser. I dropped out of college because I was lazy. Lived with my parents and worked full time to beagle to pay my loans back and then moved into a small apartment after getting promised a promotion and relocating to a new town.

That promotion never happened and I got screwed hard by the employer in the process. After that I changed positions to make enough money to make ends meet but was met with cut hours to keep me screwed.

I found a new job and it's decent, pays the bills but is very stressful at times due to staffing. 

Thats just background.

Well to start, I lost a ton of weight and while thats good, the fact that I'm trapped as a ball of deflated dough and look like a melted marshmallow without clothes on is the only real impact that's done on me. I went from being a blob no one would show interest in to a deflated blob no one cares to see either. Im going to alone forever because I'm hideous and feel like I'm not good enough. 

And some may say that can be fixed, no it cant...not in any feasible sense.

Now the older I get the worse it all gets, I'm getting older and older and just hate it all more and more.

The last few months I've been thinking a lot about life and where I want it to go and have come to the realization that this is probably as good as its going to get for me.

Every year more and more things go wrong medically and any im having to take off work to go to appointments coupled with having to figure out how to stretch my finances to be able to afford those appointments. 

I recently developed a blood clot in my leg and was referred to a vein specialist and was feeling like I was finally take care of a big problem (my veins are all garbage from being so over weight) and fixing something that would both increase my overall health and help alleviate a lot of self consciousness I feel towards my appearance. 

Well thats once again screwed me over. I feel like the doctor is taking me for a ride and I just recently discovered that the whole procedure isn't even covering the parts I thought (and was told) it was. So im just thousands of dollars in debt more and have nothing to show for it.

Every single time I feel like I'm getting somewhere, I am forcefully shown how foolish hoping for good is. It's at the point where I'm just done trying. 

Nothing in this world is worth a damn anymore. Everything just wants your money, your information or your time. The past few days I've been in a very dark place and keep circling the drain of how I would go about ending it.

I'm not joking when I say the only...and I mean ONLY thing that's stopping me right now is that I have a small furry feline laying next to me that is too pampered and relies on me too much for me to leave her. The thought of her being left alone and neglected is the sole reason I haven't taken my own life at this point.

I'm not sure what to do, I can't afford therapy and refuse to just drug myself to make it go away. I'm tired of trying so hard and going nowhere but backwards. I just want off this ride but can't seem to figure out how."
191yq9d,Depression,2024-01-08,Honestly I need advice,"18M and slightly autistic. Tbh I don't know if I have depression honestly I need advice on what to do. around 80% of the day every day I feel down. Not incredibly bad but enough for me to not want to do anything productive and I spend almost all my free time doing whatever I can to try to make myself feel happy yet some days it works others it's worse and it doesn't work.

The only 3 things in life that make me happy anymore are my Xbox and my gf and my pet leopard gecko Theodore. Op

Absolutely everything else in life I try to enjoy or get motivation to do but simplely can't.

I want to get a job but I'm scared that I will have a day or multiple days where I'm feeling so bad that I mentally can't handle it.

I really don't do anything productive anymore and I want to but I have absolutely no motivation to do it and it just feels like a chore with no reward after every step of anything.

So my schedule is go to bed whenever wake up whenever if my disabled grandpa needs help with anything I help him play Xbox about 60% of the day since it's the only thing I can do to make me happy at this point. Wait to see if gf wants to call if not go to bed repeat.

Any suggestions?"

So I'm on daily 50mg amitriptyline for moderate depression (sometimes mild, sometimes severe..). I understand that this is a paltry dosage but please understand that I've always been medication sensitive and often have not need full dose to achieve the same effects as what is considered normal, and not just anti-depressants (I'm 100kg+ as well, go figure :))

It works, and the side effects are tolerable, however since being on it I've increased dosage twice after about 5 months as I felt like I was becoming resistant to the benefits.

It's happening again...

I'm ok today, actually feeling really good, but I took mental snapshot a couple days ago that I can refer to and things weren't good.

I know I should - and I will - talk to my GP about it, I'm not looking for direct medication advice that I'll take to them, **I just wanted to know generally if anyone ever found a dosage of amitriptyline that they settled on longer term?**

I also understand that it's a less common medication and that newer SSRIs or what have you are preferred nowadays, but I think the original psychiatrist spotted some synergy with Migraine issues I had (I only get about 2 a year now - woohoo!).

They put me in the “college” ward (which was a fucking lie because my roommate was my grandmas age). Then the doctors put me on a TCA which I know are not easily tolerated but I went with it because I wanted to get better. Every time I stood up I couldn’t see anything even on the lowest dose. My blood pressure was dropping very low and my ears would ring for 5 minutes straight. I felt sick and awful. I was told they’d be increasing the dose overtime and they never did they kept me on the same dose for a whole week before taking me off because I was not tolerating the medication. I was never told about how the medication was not increasing. 

Then I was prescribed trazodone instead of my normal sleep meds and THEY DID NOT TELL ME. I had severe panic attacks and I was crying and begging my mom to help me over the phone every night. 

Finally they put me on an antipsychotic because they said I had BPD which my mom (who is a social worker) and I just completely disagree with. But again I go along with it to get better. I was on a baby dose and I was twitching and shaking like crazy. My legs were like jello and I didn’t have enough strength to shower I had to crawl into my bathtub just to was myself. And even then I laid on the bathroom floor feeling like I couldn’t breathe.

“We wouldn’t give you something that would hurt you.” I’ve heard it so many times. It’s all bullshit. They care more about the money in their pockets then my actual life. I’m just so tired of being stuffed full of meds that just make me feel disgusting. I’m so tired."

Dentistry has been my passion and I wanted to pursue that career, but I wasn’t ready to start studying (heavily depressed and confused during COVID and felt pressured by my friends and family to start studying) I started Dental school but I was so miserable at the time I blamed it strictly on the school and that it’s a shitty job to pursue. I saw that the grass is greener on the medical school side so I worked extremely (really fucking hard) and convinced myself this is what I wanted. After a few thousands of dollars I got accepted and moved to the medical program at my school. (I study in the middle east). After a year and after I got my shit together in life I understood the mistake I’ve made and the reasons why I made the change became clearer. I can go back to Dental school but I’m so fucking scared, how would my peers react for making the switch again, getting friends once again with new people, I’ll be doing 8 years of school and not 6 and see all my former classmates graduating 2 years before me and I’ll be almost 30 once completing dental school.
I feel so tired and depressed, what should I do with my self?"
191watt,Depression,2024-01-08,Always bored,"I find that I’m always bored and never having fun. I’m not necessarily sad or having feelings of guilt, but I can’t seem to enjoy much. I play video games and watch YouTube as my hobbies but I usually only do them because it isn’t schoolwork rather than for enjoyment. The only time I get enjoyment is when I have a new drug to abuse. I don’t have an issue and only partake in these activities every 2-4 months. Simply because they are the only things that truly can put my boredom as ease and allows me to take interest in the things I used to love doing (playing games and watch yt). Anyone can provide some advice?"
191wa5x,Depression,2024-01-08,Why do I have to be the one?,"I’m sick of being the one who supports and helps everyone, putting on a happy and silly face or minding my own to keep others happy.
When will it be my turn to earn the love and support? When will it be my turn to get help when asked? I don’t understand the disconnect. I come from a good and supported family and despite being supported in certain ways, it seems I have been put on the back burner. I understand that a lot is changing, my siblings moving out and up, but I’m just stagnant. I would argue that I am the least stable in my entire family despite no changes happening for me."
191w2by,Depression,2024-01-08,My life story,"In a world where love should bloom, There are hearts shrouded in gloom. Aching souls, yearning to be seen, Enduring the pain of feeling unseen.

Unloved, a heavy burden to bear, With wounds that seem too much to repair. Aching echoes of empty embraces, Leaving traces of lonely spaces.

But listen closely, dear soul, to this rhyme, For within your heart, love transcends time. Though unloved you may feel in this hour, Know that your worth holds immeasurable power.

In the depths of despair, strength resides, As resilience within you quietly abides. Unloved, yet deserving of affection's grace, You possess an inner glow, a radiant embrace.

Embrace the love that blooms within, A precious gift, where healing begins. Seek solace in friendships and kindred hearts, Unveiling the beauty unloved imparts.

For in the cracks of your fractured heart, A mosaic of strength and resilience shall start. There lies a spark, a flame yet to ignite, A testament of your unwavering might.

Remember, dear one, you are not alone, Even in darkness, seeds of love are sown. Open your heart, let compassion be your guide, And know that love, someday, will reside."
191vwys,Depression,2024-01-08,What does “put your own air mask on first” mean?,"Navigating the concept of ""self-care"" has always been challenging for me. I’m autistic which probably caused CPTSD and anxiety. I have been unemployed for a year now. 

Currently, my partner is grappling with unemployment and depression. How does the idea of ""putting on one's face mask first"" apply in this situation? 

How would you apply that to yourself or does anyone think it doesn’t apply at all?"

191uow8,Depression,2024-01-08,My life was over for a year but the misery never ends.,"I am in real hell of agony with no way out.
I have nowhere to write this, since even on the internet almost nobody has it that bad. Its pointless, but I'm writing again after a long time of not talking, since I'm sadly still here.

My life collapsed. I cannot describe the physical and mental agony I am feeling every moment of every day. I spent a year sick, spent all my money on doctors in the first half, and it only got worse in the second half. I have progressive exhaustion, muscle weakness, gastroenterological issues, heart arrythmias, problems breathing, lost half my body weight this year. I can't eat, drink, move, breathe, do anything normally for many months. Due to all this I got into practically infinite debt. I never worked a normal job and I'm incapable of, I have severe mixed depression anxiety disorder and schizoid personality. I only ever traded crypto and it's the only real world thing worth something that I was decent at in my whole life. Also addicted to Xanax for over a year now. I tried to treat my mental problems years ago spent a fortune and everyone ended up telling me they can't help me. I started to self destruct, giving away money, and spiraling downwards since a few years ago. But now it's been a long time since I've been past my mental limit. I think the only reason why I haven't had a full on mental breakdown is cause I don't want to be locked up in one of worst hospitals in my country.

Been to the ER like 5 times, had a referral for a hospital stay, denied. Instead they want to claim I'm mentally ill and that causes all of it. Despite the fact that I have huge scoliosis, NAFLD, allergy, possible asthma/COPD, etc. Its all pointless. Every doctor claims different things and it's always been like this for me.

I'm stuck with my weird mentally sick penniless family until I'm dead. They understand nothing and wouldn't help me even if I collapsed in front of them. I survived like a rat living without my own room for almost 3 decades, something out of this world.

All of this is probably just the tip of the iceberg. There's no help anywhere. I think I'm gonna get a heart attack or a stroke soon. Feel like I'm dying every day. I'm too tired to go on. Please let me rest and get me out of this hell."

191u55v,Depression,2024-01-08,Antidepressants stopped working,"Hi everyone

I'm not sure if this is the correct place to ask this but I have been taking antidepressants for years ever since finding out I am autistic in 2018. I started to take them properly every day the month after my father passed away in May 2022. I then felt extremely good for almost a solid year. I would go as far as to say I felt the best I ever did in my life. I just felt extremely happy and very confident all the time. However I got too confident, and I thought maybe I did not need them anymore, so I went to Spain and decided to stop taking them.

I then started to feel down again when I got home, so I started taking them again but they were not having any affect whatsoever on me. I tried changing medication from the Escitalopram I was on for years, to Duloxetine which did nothing, and now I am on Venlafex since Christmas day. I still do not notice any difference at all. Is it a case that maybe I just have to keep taking them for months so that I get used to them again or what? It's bothering me a lot because I miss my happy euphoric state that I was in everyday for almost a solid year.

I genuinely loved life and I had no anxiety or low-feelings at all, and now I am scared that I am going back to the way I was before. Any help would be much appreciated, thanks."

191twyd,Depression,2024-01-08,Vent about being stuck,"I’m stuck in a cycle of depression and anxiety. I’m not even trying anymore. I can’t/won’t do the things that would help. Everyone says exercise, eat right, socialize, etc. 
I make myself go outside once a day. I walk to the coffee shop a block away. Otherwise I’m at home (I live alone). 
I can’t seem to make myself exercise. I haven’t cooked in years so it’s just cereal and frozen meals. 
I have one friend that I see once a month. It’s hard to talk to her because I don’t do anything so there’s nothing to talk about. 
It’s winter so it’s dark all the time. I don’t have any hobbies. Nothing interests me. (Anhedonia is a cool word.) I wish I knew how to play video games to pass the time. 
I’m crying all the time. Yes, I have a therapist and a psychiatrist for meds (they don’t help. I can only think how much worse I’d be without them.) A massage sounds nice but I’m too anxious to phone. My house is a mess. 
Deadlines and schedules don’t work because I know they’re fake. 
My comforts are my cats, squirrels and the Doctor Who marathon I’m having. No idea what I’ll do when it ends.

191tqfd,Depression,2024-01-08,No clue why I'm posting here,"My life is fine. Not great, but nothing to complain about tbh. I'm a therapist myself but if there is anything I have learned over the year the old adage ""healer heal thyself"" is a load of biased bullshit.

I have dealt with existential depression for decades now. My life is fine but nothing seems to ever matter to me. I make decent money and Im in relatively good health. 

I haven't had a relationship in years because I'm terrified of rejection. However in the south, being a male who isn't dating regularly means gay to most of the hillbillies around here. To be fair though, I would consider myself leaning on the side of sexually fluid, but like 85% straight. It feels weird since that's the first time I've openly said that.

I currently reside with my grandmother and father, which is another huge red flag for most people given I am over 40 years old. I usually tell people it is because my grandmother is very ill and my father isn't capable of caring for her, but that is mostly a lie. Sure, neither of them can really do anything that is physically taxing around the house, but neither really need regular support for basic living.

I tried to kill myself in my mid 20s with pills and alcohol, but I woke up with the worlds worst hangover 2 days later in my dorm room. No one had even noticed that I had gone missing. I swore to myself I wouldn't go out like that, but as I continue to age I am realize that I can't make that promise to myself. But I'm trying real hard but Ive honestly had the thoughts pop in a few times and I fight them off.

Ive tried pot and it helps with anxiety and my constant negative self talk but any more than once a week and it backfires on me. Same with shrooms, Ive been micro dosing hoping to get rid of my depression, but I am beginning to believe that only a large dose is going to be effective.

Im an atheist, so for me there is no hope for some magical afterlife. I don't believe there are invisible sky people I can call upon and they help to fix everything. I believe that I will live until I die and when I die I will cease to be.

Ive done therapy, mindfulness, medication, group, etc. Nothing has ever had an effect for more than a few weeks or if I got lucky a few months before they slid back to where they started. I just don't know what to do. I don't want to be here anymore if I can't just be accepted for who I am, in whatever form that might be. But I also have too many people that would be devastated in the event that I did something. Plus I promised multiple people that I wouldn't do anything like that, and I like to think of myself as not being a liar.

At the end of the day my depression doesn't really stem from anything in this write up, I just posted them as a framework to who I am as a person. For me, everything is devoid of meaning. I just see through all the ephemera that other people cling to to stay happy or distracted, but cant seem to manage any feelings myself. I don't even really know what I am asking as I feel this entire post has just gone in some non-linear story time but I need some guidance before the darkness that lives deep inside of me get a firm grip and decides it's taking me down for good."

I've known for a long time something was wrong with me, and I've spent a lot of time bettering myself.

I hit a slump about 3 years ago. A slump so bad I was self destructing and fast, multiple suicide attempts.  
Back then my main problem was money, I had none of it. The stress of paying bills and not being able to eat properly was too much for me. I got addicted to drugs and they seemed to be the only thing that kept me going.  


It's now 3 years later. I have a good stable job that pays well. It looks like currently I'm able to save up for a house within the next 5 years. My job is extremely flexible with how I work and when I work and I have a girlfriend I'm head over heels for.  


When I look back to 3 years ago these were all the things I wished for, which I thought would fix me. I thought that if I just got rid of my problems, then there would be nothing to make me feel like shit.

Fast forward to now and I have all these things. Not even in a superficial way. I genuinely like my job I genuinely love my girlfriend and my life in general has become so much more stable.  
So can anybody tell me why the fuck I still feel like shit?  


It's not as bad as 3 years ago, I don't have nearly as many suicidal tendencies, but for christ sake I'm so fucking tired of struggling to get out of bed every morning. To struggle getting anything fucking done. My head never shuts the fuck up about me being a waste of fucking space to any stupid small inconvenience.

I'm out of options, it feels like i've tried everything. Is this just life now? Am I just doomed to feel like this all the time? Am I supposed to just be content with feeling bad every single day, where it's not bad enough that I want to end it all every second?

191rt11,Depression,2024-01-08,Just a little vent,"Hey 21m, turning 22 in a few weeks and it's kind of getting on my nerves. 

I broke up with my girlfriend 22f of 3 years due to selfish and ungrateful reasons  3 months ago, we were still talking and flirting and all that during that period but she made it officially over 3 weeks ago and it's killing me. 

She highlighted what I did wrong throughout the 3 years and it killed me on the inside and when I highlighted what she did wrong it's like she shoved me off. 

When I tried to fix things she just pushed me away, we barely talk now and when we do it's either dry or one sided and she sometimes gives off mixed signals and then gets upset when I follow along those signals. 

Yesterday she sent me a pic of her wearing my hoodie (the hoodie I gave her), and said ""do you mind if I wear it, it keeps me warm"" I said go ahead you look good in it and the convo ended there, I tried reaching out to her a few hours ago and still no response. 

She wanted space to heal and stuff but I believe that space is gonna make her detach more and more. 

I have a speculation that she met someone else already and it's kinda getting to me. 

For context I recently moved to Amsterdam 4 days ago and she's in France, we are both from the same country and have recently traveled and parted ways. 

2 months ago she moved and I think France changed her and everything... And idk I'm so lost and confused. 

I've been feeling very sad and anxious ever since the break up and the last 4 days ever since I moved things have been going down hill. 

New country, no friends yet, single, alone, confused, and my anxiety has peaked so much. 

I know therapy is an option but I can't really afford it right now. 

Should I wait for her? Should I move on and block her on everything? I'm genuinely seeking advice as well. I feel so alone and don't feel like venting to my friends back home as they don't really like her and will definitely give me a toxic approach to the situation. 

I still love her and deeply care about her, so what do I do? What can help me in anyway?"

My life has mainly been a shitshow (my own doing) and I have often had periods when I felt depressed but in the last couple of months it's been getting worse depression wise. I feel bored all the time. I have no energy to do anything except for shower (because looking good is like breathing to me). I have no appetite. School work is getting too hard to do. I have some social anxiety and don't have any contacts outside of my bf who lives with me thank god. Sometimes I believe he'd be better off with someone else and that I make his life worse. I think I hate myself. I do or used to do bad things without any remorse and I've kind of destroyed any values for myself that a person's supposed to have. I feel like every aspect of myself and my life is wrong and I don't have the ability to fix things. I believe I've always been wrong. Lately it crosses my mind to hurt myself again but not enough to do it. Last time I hurt myself was 2 months ago and I had to go to the er. It was kinda nice to wallow in how messed up I am almost.
Basically all I do is sit in my bed and smoke cigarettes inside.

I have an appointment with a psychiatrist in a few days and I think I might need some meds but I'm very scared of the side effects, especially sexual ones. I absolutely can't stand any decrease in desire or function. I know all meds cause that to some degree however and that sucks. 

I guess this is mostly a vent post. I hope I didn't break any community guidelines."
191qmou,Depression,2024-01-08,Tired of people repeating the same things again and again,"TW: mentions of suicide/hospitals.

It's a funny irony how quickly people panic when you show symptoms of your illness and how equally quickly they forget. I'd never blame them if I did something to myself, but I do find it an hypocrisy to parrot to me how there's ""always hope and someone willing to help"".

NEWSFLASH BABES, both are bs. I could laugh so hard at this saying. One week -- that's how long it takes for people to show you their true face. A week ago I was dealing with some health issues and ended up in the Hospital. I'm not okay now, but I'm 'discharged' so therefore supposedly 'fine'. Though I clearly stated I was far from fine.

Of course when I was hospitalized everyone remembered I exist outside their bubble, had a brief panic and reached out. Like I said, I can't even get angry at them for it. It's the natural order of things: people live their lives, and a suicide is a slap to the face. I really wish I could free them from those chains of guilt and worry that inevitably come afterwards.

One week later and no one has even checked-in. Not a soul. And it brings me a measure of peace, because I know inside that I am, bitter and dark as it is, right about the day I eventually commit: they will move on with their lives just fine. Will it hurt for a while? Yes. Will it be shocking? Yes. But they will recover and the World will keep on orbiting the Sun.

That I have to survive in misery to spare them the occasional wave of grief feels like something above me. Maybe I'm selfish. Or maybe I have a debilitating chronic illness and since I couldn't choose to be born, I would at least like to choose what to do with my life. Which is end it. How soon? Who knows. Lately it feels like it's coming closer. Like I don't want to see the Calendar turn to 2025. 

In my defense I can say I have been distant because I think a part of me always knew I would end my own life. And again, they might miss me sometimes -- but it's a lot easier to get used to not seeing someone you *never* saw anyway than it is to get used to someone you saw often. My isolation and loneliness have been the small thing I could do to maybe spare them some grief.

My mom is the only exception. So far she has been my anchor, but I'm starting to wane. I don't even want to die, but my illness makes it so hard to live I might as well be dead now. I can't do anything other than set alarms to keep myself hydrated. I've lost interest in everything. It's absurd: the only thing I'm looking forward to is a TV Show that comes out in June, and I kinda wanna watch. Afterwards, I'm a free woman.

Leaving my Mom behind will tear me apart and I will go fully believing I deserve the worst of punishments. But I will also go if I decide I ultimately can give her more in death than I can in life. Right now all I do is cause her anguish and worry. We barely talk. We live together and I miss her. If I had to guess, I was a mistake pregnancy, a glitch I will fix. I'm not saying she doesn't love me, but I was never meant to be born.

I wish this weren't such a taboo topic, and I could walk into a clinic and pay a bit to make sure it's painless. I already attempted it once with very limited knowledge back in 2018, under VERY different circumstances. This time there won't be a third, that's what I promised myself, so I will have to go with a method that has a low percentage of failing. The plan is there, it's just a matter of when. Can I change my mind? Yes. 

But not if I don't receive the help I need before June, help my Mom is paying a lot for as I sit and watch, feeling useless. If they knew how much I'd be willing to go through if it meant I can cure this illness and live a semi-normal life. God knows what they want to do with me, if this is my fate, but June is a good month. Right before my birthday, and the weather will be cold enough. I can survive these months ironing out the last details, OR getting better if life wants me to. 

But gosh does it feel relieving to know I have an exit plan. I'm tired of being collared to life. If my life is mine, then so is my right to choose when to end it. "
191qk9z,Depression,2024-01-08,Thought it was getting better and it all broke,So basically I hadn’t posted here for like a year or even more I thought that it’s getting better.But ofc that something had to happen.For context I’m 16M and i fell in love with one girl.Today she told me that she doesn’t want any relationship and also like 10 minutes ago had a huge argument with my mom and she told me that she doesn’t care about me.This all made me cry for the first time in like 9 months or something like that and everything rn is just too much for me
191qir4,Depression,2024-01-08,Idk what to do - need ideas (vent),"I'm in a depressed mood. I have been in it for at least a month and I don't know how to get out of it. My therapist hasn't been super helpful with it. I am in between therapy sessions right now, and am trying to avoid having to set up another meeting with my school counselor. I have come close to relapsing (sh) multiple times. At home there is a lot of arguing, and my Mom doesn't understand I don't need her on me about any little thing and so neither of those are helping. Plus, as a student, it's the end of the semester in about 2 weeks so it's finals and stuff. I am on track to fail a class as well. I don't know what to do and I am stuck. Anyone have any ideas?"
191qfxr,Depression,2024-01-08,I want to die,"I want to die a quick, painless death. This life isn't fucking fair and I failed at everything. I even failed my own child by having a shitty womb. I miss them so much and all I want is to be reunited with them. I *hate* this world and I don't even want to see my 24th birthday. I'm a joke and *nothing* has ever worked in my favour. I even failed school because of my stupid fucking ADHD and I can't even go to college because it's too loud and busy. I wasn't even supposed to be born. I should have drowned on holiday when I was 9. My sister shouldn't have saved me. I'm a useless human being and I'd be happier not being in this dismal void called the world."
191qdg8,Depression,2024-01-08,Growing apathy for my depression,"Recently I've noticed a strange evolution in my very long-running depression. It is a change that on the surface I find quite soothing and positive, but that also leaves me a little bit worried about its possible consequences in the future.  
  
For context, let's just say that I've been consistently depressed since my teenage years, for more than a decade, growing into extreme social isolation, anxiety and constant suicidal ideation.  
  
I've been under treatment, with dubious success, for years now, and I would typically alternate a vast majority of time being depressed, and some rare glimpses of reason.  
  
However recently, as I've said, things seem to have changed. My life situation is still stressfull and uncertain. I'm unemployed, I'm unmotivated to do anything, I seldom have taste for anything in life, I don't feel like socializing or going out, and above all, my biggest stressor is that I don't see any place for me in society, in any career, or being of any real utility to anyone else, not even to myself, except as a way of providing the basic necessities for my life.  
  
And yet, despite all this, which would surely before have plunged me into complete, harrowing despair, I find myself perfectly apathetic about it. I look at this inextricable knot of self-constructed despair, and I feel nothing whatsoever about it. If I may one day have some pleasure in life, so be it, if not then so be it. If I may be of some utility one day for others, so be it, otherwise whatever. Might I feel content and proud one day of what I do? So be it, and if not, so be it too.  
  
As for the dreaded present, where I languish knowing not what to do, liking nothing and no one, mute as I am in my little inward prison, let me distract myself as much as I can and not think about anything.  
  
When I have no choice, I will act, and in all this I will choose to stay as apathetic and calm as I am.  
  
And when I hear voices telling me that I will never amount to anything, that I am pathetic, that life is not worth living for, then I retort to these voices that they might be right, and if so, so will it be, but that they might be wrong also, and that happiness, belonging and self-accomplishment are also in the realm of my possibilities in life, and if so, let them be, they souldn't be killed at birth.  
  
I have crossed my arms out of sheer ennui against this lingering worm that has festered upon my mind for so long. Do you want to devour me entirely? Please, I say bon appétit to you! I will not spice up your meal with my tears anymore.  
  
And maybe one day, soon enough, I will uncross my arms, and I will walk away with a smile on my face, leaving behind this dark, heavy sun that has made my soul kneel all these long long years.

&amp;#x200B;

Dramatized rant aside, I wonder if anyone ever felt the same, and if they had any positive evolution come out of this."
191q5hz,Depression,2024-01-08,I've lost interest in all my hobbies,"It feels pointless because no one will ever see my art or appreciate them and I just wonder why try doing hobbies when I should just stay in bed and do nothing
Edit: Holy crap you guys are awesome! Thank you guys for the advice and words of encouragement! I might get back to creating art again thank you!"
191pvmw,Depression,2024-01-08,I think I'm getting scammed by my therapist,"So I've been seeing this pretty meh, mediocre therapist for 4 years. My primary choice was him because I can get there in 20 minutes by public transport, and that's a huge positive for me.

The thing is that in the last 4 years, he increased his fees about 4-5 times by a total of +80%. Yes, I understand that there is inflation and there was COVID and so on, but interestingly enough he always raises his prices when I talk about my extra income.

Last time he increased immediately after I told him I got a raise in my new job, and now after I shared with him that I get a couple of extra bucks by flipping items online, he finishes our session with: ""Oh, did I tell you I raised my rates?""

Am I being paranoid here? Has anyone else experienced something like this before?

EDIT: he almost doubled his prices, close to +80% over the 4 year"

191psmm,Depression,2024-01-08,Had suicidal thoughts for the first time today,"Hi All,

Recently, I have been feeling quite lonely due to the stress of work among other factors. I have never felt any love in my life and I have simply been looking for someone to love me unconditionally, be it a partner or a friend. However, I find it incredibly difficult to find acceptance from anyone. 

Some questions I often think of are:

How have I let this happen to me? 

How does everyone have friends? 

Why do people act so arrogant nowadays? 

In my attempts to gain some validation, I tried a few dating apps but that just exacerbated this feeling. 

My life involves working my job, going to the gym, and daily chores. However, all I can think of is how do I get the acceptance? which affects my performance throughout the day. I have started taking the blame on myself nowadays, maybe there is something incredibly terrible about me, while this has never been pointed out. I have always practiced kindness and being labelled as a ""kind"" one. So where is the karma now? 

I am very tired of living like this, not sure if I want to start a new chapter or close the book. What can I do to make me love myself? "

191pkkt,Depression,2024-01-08,Unable to love?,"After all these years, I thought I was making some progress in self love, but it seems like I'm heading back to square 1. 
I think I really like a guy, a really nice guy. But the point is, I keep on thinking I'm not ready to ""fall in love"" because I'm not good enough, I'm not mentally stable. I feel annoyed by myself, dealing with all these moods. I don't want him to take care a mentally unstable person, because I feel like it will drain his energy and leave me anyway. I also feel I'm not worthy of love, my therapist makes me aware of this but I still feel that way. 
We are friends, and there were times I wanted to confess my feelings, but i always predict the worst situation, which is not being friends with him anymore. Another reason I didn't confess is because I'm not sure how he thinks of me. I was the one who always approach him but he does reply me back and hang out with me. 
Sorry for ranting, it's not that important but let me wrote it out for now."

191p57e,Depression,2024-01-08,So tired of this mental merry go round,"39/f, married (second marriage), 4 kids ranging from 22 to 3. I lived a hard up hill battle life to this point. Everything from here is not chronological just going off my thoughts. I was sexually manipulated, mentally and physically abused at 13 by my at the time boyfriend. Emotionally neglated since the time I was 6 by my family, which really helped the abusive boyfriend at such a young age. I was 15 and got pregnant to the abuser. My mother made me get an abortion. Still trigger by that day in my life. Was able to get out of the abusive relationship by the time I was 16, thanks to my first husband. We got pregnant when I was 17. I wouldn't get an abortion that time and we had our 1st kid. I then got married at 18 because my family practically made me. I did graduate high school but left my mother and grandmother's house by the time I was 17 and before I had my oldest. I moved in with my first husband at 17 into section 8 housing. Tried to go to school for vet tech and dropped out because I was too busy trying to have fun or figuring out what I really wanted to do. Always had a job though from the time I was 16. I eventually bought a house with my mom who came to realize how my grandmother was dealing with dementia and having no support. When we bought the house we ended up having 7 people under one roof. I was the only one working. I supported everyone with and $8.50 job. At some point I was ready to leave my husband because he did nothing but get high and play video games with his friends all day. He didn't want to grow up. But then I got pregnant right before I turned 21 while I was on birth control. We were only sexually active because letting him have sex would get him to leave me alone. By the time my 2nd kid turn 1 I was done. He literally never took care of her and passed her off to everyone else to take care of instead. I kicked him out when I was 22. I also then left the house with my mother due to her enabling my sister's drug addiction.  I had multiple flings from that point until I met my now husband. We started off so great and he was good to my kids. He was solid and gave me confidence. We got pregnant (on purpose to keep the kids ages close) and then married. We had the baby and it was a traumatic birth. Emergency c section that I had 10 minutes to process. It was a lot and i was lot prepared for that. And he still tells me that I was being ridiculous on how I handled that. His one friend had a crush on me and tried to plant in my brain that my new husband was cheating on me. It messed me up and we went through a really tough time. We eventually went to couples counseling and it helped. Point being now is we've always had bad communication. I always feel like I'm being attacked and I never get any validation for my feelings. I feel like he's changed me and literally sucked my essence from me. I am no longer any resemblance of the person I know I can be. I'm always upsetting him. I started going to counseling last year after he told me he can no longer deal with me. He always talks about how he wants to go to counseling but he'll only do in person and there's no one he can find that he'd even be interested in that has hours he can go. We literally have the same fights all the time. I usually express how something made me feel and then he let's out how he's just fed up with everything. Finances and the house is always his problems. I feel like even if I was physically able to do everything in the house and gave him all my money he still would never be happy. Maybe I'm being too much. Maybe I just need to stop caring. But every time he tries to express his feelings I'm literally only hearing how I'm not doing enough. I so tired. I'm so lost. I've gotten to a point that I pray something happens to take me out of this world. Quick and painless preferred since I'm a big coward. I love my kids. But I feel like because of my emotional disfunction I only hurt them being here. I know it'd be tramatic to lose their mom but they'd be better off in the end with out me. The 2 older ones are legal adults now. I sometimes have this big battle between logical brain and emotional brain and it literally spins me on so many circles its dizzying. I know I deserve to be treated well and deserve kindness, but at the same time I cannot apparently do the same in return. I'm so tired. I honestly don't care if anyone reads this and don't care if anyone comments to tell me how I'm wrong for thinking this or that or validations. I do feel a little better putting this out in the world. So if anyone else feels alone in this world, I get you. This shit sucks"

It is hard to ignore when the very people should be the pillar of your strength; ignore, hurt, and dicriminate you. No matter how you work hard , it's always not enough.

191p0y1,Depression,2024-01-08,When does it get better,"All of 2023 and the start of 2024 have been some of the worst years of my life which is crazy because every time I think “well it can’t get any worse” BOOM. Dealing with depression, anxiety etc.. isn’t new but I feel like I’ve hit an all time low and I don’t know how to make it better.

 I am finally getting my job situation better kind of but I am so behind on everything financial I can’t afford to pay my bills I have a second job lined up but I not only have let myself down but everyone around me. 

My grandpa is dying and I’m supposed to see him to say goodbye but it’s a double whammy of loss and losing pay that I can’t afford to lose by flying out there and I just don’t know what to do. I’m fucking exhausted. I feel like nothing ever will be okay. I feel like my whole life has been a failure I am a failure and hopeless and I don’t know how to keep moving past this with my head held up high like I’m not two seconds away from collapsing and never getting back up. 

I feel like my depression meds aren’t even working anymore but I don’t have time to schedule an appointment because again I can’t miss out on work I don’t have any sick time or pto yet to even use. I DONT KNOW WHAT TO DO. I’m scared and I feel alone and like I’m losing everything.  Even with the better job I took a pay cut for it to get me into the career path I want to be in and I just don’t know. I’m probably not even making sense right now. I wish I wasn’t me. I’m so fucking sad I just want it to go away. Also no this isn’t me saying I’m going to end my life- even at my lowest I know that that won’t resolve my issues and that’s not a path I’m interested in going down. 

I know I can’t just give up and stop. I know that the world keeps spinning even if i can’t keep up with it but Im fucking struggling mentally physically emotionally and everything fucking else attached. I don’t know what steps to take to fix this.

191nq09,Depression,2024-01-08,My life is bed to couch and couch to bed,"That’s it. I get up around 10 am, make it out to the couch, mostly nap all day on the couch, and drag myself back to bed around 9 pm. I have to force myself to eat. I barely leave my house at all but when I do I actually feel better for a little while. I haven’t showered in days. I mostly read on my Kindle and watch stupid YouTube videos and play dumb phone games all day. There are three people in my house but we barely even talk to each other anymore except to complain about the shitty winter weather.

I lost my job in August, my dad in September, then I got sick and had to have major surgery in late November. Then I ended up on the psych ward for 2 weeks because I just stopped eating and they couldn’t find a physical reason why so they decided I was anorexic. I’ve been home now since the day after Christmas and I just have no energy, no motivation, no interest in life at all. They put me on an anti anxiety med that at least has stopped my nervous tremors and a sedative that helps me sleep but nothing is helping the fact that I just don’t care enough to start rebuilding my life again. I’m supposed to be seeing a therapist but I keep rescheduling my appointments because I can’t find the energy to actually go.

I hate this. I want my life back but I don’t have the motivation to actually do anything about it. My emotions are dead and I just don’t care about anything anymore. I don’t want to die but I can’t stand the thought of spending the rest of my life this way."

191nn3j,Depression,2024-01-08,Ever feel cursed? Genuinely cursed...,"Last year I managed to quit my job after creating a business, was doing really well financially, really happy with some spare time for my family I'm building.

Trusted the wrong person and suddenly I lost it. All of it.

I feel like a shell, trying to make ends meet, can't make a penny despite my skills being good in what I do.

Don't spend time with my wife and kids for trying to force ends to meet, struggling to grow or adapt or keep pushing. Motivation at an all time low.

Find myself sitting on the couch most days crying... Not gonna lie.

Just, don't know how to go on. I'm bad with money so I barely saved some, what I did save I locked in a bank account as I wanted to buy a house this year.

This has gone on since birth, everytime I get somewhere I mess it up and yeah, just feel like someone cursed me. Genuinely. One person can't be this unlucky.

Born to die I guess."
191ni7h,Depression,2024-01-08,i have no one.,absolutely no one. simple as that.
191ncpv,Depression,2024-01-08,i’m spiralling.,"i feel lost.

i don’t know what i’m doing with my life.
i am slowly ruining everything in my life, studies, love life, friendships, just everything.
i’m losing interest in the only cope mechanism i have which is gaming, it doesn’t feel right anymore. i’m losing myself and im not sure what to do. i told myself i wouldn’t fail another class this semester, im failing 2 and unlikely will be able to salvage them since finals are right there. 
i don’t have that connection with my mom anymore. we argue more often and she’s gotten a sickness that im also diagnosed with. she can’t really walk, she can barely move her hands. her feet are getting super swollen then usual, and one day that’ll be me too. i wonder if ill ever find someone that’ll love me enough to care for me when the time is coming. there’s a guy im talking too and i feel like im ruining that too because im too overly jealous and in his words “get mad at shit a girlfriend would”. he flirts and in some ways acts like a boyfriend would too. we’ve been arguing lately but also just apologize at the end, i think last night ruined the vibe. i got upset and he constantly apologized but i just shut off and said ok. he told me goodnight and that he’s sorry we fought, i apologized back. i see him online but he won’t answer my messages. i’m guessing i should just give him space. i have 1 irl friendship that im also slowly ruining, other than that everyone hates me. i have no social life. each year, people give me reasons to cut them off and more reasons on why i hate people. guys, my mom is super religious and always tells me to pray when i feel alone. every time i pray, i feel the same way, like nothing has changed. i wonder if there is a God, it feels wrong to doubt too. But if there is one, why do bad things happen to good people? i never asked to be here, but here i am, depressed and everything is falling apart. i wonder if things will get better or if one day, i wake up having the balls to kill my self."

The first few days felt really good and relaxed. After about a week though, I started to get worse, and yesterday/today (10/11 days later) I feel way way worse and my depression is as bad if not worse than it's ever been. It's absolute agony. Does anyone else who has quit caffeine know what's going on? Is it going to be a few more weeks of pain before my body starts to re-normalize?"
191n3hx,Depression,2024-01-08,I don’t know what to do.,"I’m 27 and have been so depressed these last 6 years. I live with family but all the way in the attic and every day I wake up alone. Growing up my whole family lived here together. I loved it when I was younger, it was a full house. Now almost everybody is gone except for my mom &amp; brother &amp; grandparents. The house feels empty. Everybody is doing their own things and I’m stuck up here every day feeling lonely and depressed because of all the things that have happened over the years. Parents dealing with drug abuse (and my mom who still struggles and tries to lie about it to the rest of the family), family illness, family not caring about my wellbeing the way I do theirs. I recently started working a warehouse job and it’s the first serious full time job I’ve been able to somewhat handle for as long as I can remember. And it’s only been a little more than 2 months. It’s an okay job, but I just feel like there has to be more to life. I feel like I’m too depressed to work a job like this for my whole life. It isn’t fulfilling. But I just don’t know what else I can do. I don’t have many interests. I feel so lost and lonely, I really don’t know what to do anymore. If you made it this far into my post, I just want to say thank you. Even if you don’t respond, I appreciate your time. May God bless you all"
191n34n,Depression,2024-01-08,I don't know what I'm feeling anymore.,"""I’m a paradox. I want to be happy, but I think of things that make me sad. I’m lazy, yet I’m ambitious. I don’t like myself, but I also love who I am. I say I don’t care, but I really do. I crave attention, but reject it when it comes my way. I’m a conflicted contradiction. If I can’t figure myself out, there’s no way anyone else has.""- Tumblr user pursuitofamy  
  
This. This whole statement is exactly what I've been feeling all of my life. I don't understand it. My friends don't understand it. I can be the funniest person in the room. out-going, making everyone feel like family (I've been told that is a gift I have. Making ANYONE feel like we've know each other for years) and yet be soooo damn shy! I know what WILL make me happy (singing, acting, being creative) but I am so lazy and afraid that I avoid it at all costs, BUT I am so depressed from NOT doing it!! I want to do it, but I'm too sad to do it! what is this?! Am I losing my mind?!  
  
I get into these strange dark places. It starts as feeling melancholy, then I would look at the news or hear a sad song etc and spiral, I MEAN FALL into this really dangerous dark mood. Friends will call, I wont answer. And they know at that point to reach out as much as they can because this is what happens to me. THIS IS ALL MY LIFE! How can I be so damn funny and want to kill myself almost everyday? How can I be happy a few days to the point of signing up for fun things, promising friends I will do this and that with them cause everything is looking GREAT! Then out of nowhere want to jump in front of the 5:30 pm express train IN A MATTER OF DAYS?!  
  
People have told me that I'm a beautiful woman. That I should even try out to be a model. There are days when I FEEL like the highest paid super model, then the majority of the days I feel like I was a joke God came up with so he threw my face together to see just how ""crazy"" He can get! I know this is what being a woman is with our chemical make up causing these mood swings but I would actually want to rip my face off when I had these moments happen.  
  
I want to be better. I was going to the gym and that helped a lot (I lost 15 lbs! That was ALOT for me I was so excited!)  
  
Then.  
  
It happened.  
  
The melancholy feeling.  
  
Then suicidal thoughts.  
  
And now I haven't been to the gym in months, smoking again, drinking, wanting to die.  
  
But I was fine. Before.  
  
Nothing really ""bad"" happened. I just got sad.  
  
Really sad.  
  
Dark. sad.  
  
Why cant I just shake it off and get my life together? I know the power is in my hand, cause DUH only I can create the life I want. So then why wont I do it? Why do I just want to lay in bed and stare at the ceiling. Or drink that bottle of diet pills with a bleach chaser? The only real reason I haven't done it is because I'm thinking of my mom. I'm all she has. Me dying will literally end her life. I'm living so she will too.  
  
Tell me I'm not alone in this paradox of emotions, that are confusing, and madding. The desire to be freed but finding comfort in the strange familiarity of sadness and anxiety. What is wrong with me? I don't even know what I feel anymore...I'm scared."
191mu9p,Depression,2024-01-08,Why Can’t Some Get Better?,I feel like I am one of those people who suffers and can never see that light at the end of the dark as shit tunnel. I think I have been constantly depressed for years. I tried therapy multiple times. I was doing wonderful until 2021. I ended a 6 year relationship/common law marriage. I was about to get married and then i was unhappy and ended it with a nuclear bomb. I feel like I’m always in quick sand and I’m constantly trying to pull myself out. I know I don’t want to die but I want to feel something. I want to feel that I’m alive. It feels like I have multiple voices in my head telling me I’m a bad person and I don’t deserve happiness.
191mocn,Depression,2024-01-08,I´m done,"First of all, sorry for the bad english, its not my native language. Im 30. I have tried everything people say u must do to get out of depression. Study to have a carrer, having a job, exercise, therapy, meds, self help books, having a girlfriend, being single and hanging out with friends, having sleep hygiene, anything to try to get better. But things dont get better, they only get worse. Getting older hasnt brought a single good thing into my life. Not even one. I remember being depressed when I was young, in my teenage years and in my early 20s. I was depressed, but most of the time I was also confident that things would get better. I had a ton of hope that my older version would be smart and wise enough to make things better. But my ADHD only got worse, and so did my depression. I have failed my family, I have failed the jobs I tried. And, most important, I have failed myself. I have fell in despair and depression so many times that I cant even count, but somehow I have always got up. But everytime I got up I was weaker, and my confidence and hope in myself was lower. Things dont ever get better, not for me. Maybe I can insist in this pathetic spectacle that my life is for a little longer. I can if I really want to. But for what? Just to come here in 10 years and tell everyone that my life somehow managed to get even more pathetic and sad at 40yo than it already is at 30yo? whats the meaning of all this shit? is it a marathon of suffering to see how much shit we can take? for how long can someone be miserable before giving up? Im old enough to see I cant improve and be happy, whatever the hell that even means. Things will only get worse, but Im too coward to do something about it. "
191mmrn,Depression,2024-01-08,"Everyone always leaves at the end, what’s the point??? 24f","
THEY ALWAYS DO.
even when you pour your entire heart into them, do things to make them happy, try to spend quality time etc etc one day they wake up and realize they are done. That there is better out there for them. Never fails.
So what’s the point of dating??? They’re gonna leave, maybe in a year maybe multiple, but someone is going to end up with a broken heart 97% of the time if it doesn’t lead to marriage. 
Knowing this should I even try to date anymore? It’s done nothing but destroy me more and more each time to the point of where I don’t feel capable of loving anymore like truly.
I loved my ex but part of me wonders if I loved the attention, I thought I loved how committed he was to me too but he cheated. After that I’m convinced every man cheats no matter in what way they do it. There’s always someone else. Am I wrong? What’s wrong with me?

I’m not ugly. I’m smart. Have a decent family. Take care of myself. But I somehow get played? The second I relax and trust my partner enough to stop worrying about what they’re doing that crap happens, like do I have to be high alert 24/7 for them to not cheat? It would be nice to trust someone fully and them respect you behind your back. But that’s damn near impossible in this generation . This is pushing me to the edge, I’ve been in 4 relationships and it seems like I’m a failure, i know im young etc but some young people end up lucky. They say well you’re picking the wrong ones but how do you know if they’re right?"

Last month, I have felt nothing but happiness, not one ounce of sadness was in my body, which was an amazing feeling, the only thing sad I hang on to is my music bc it has turnt into comfort music, I listen to sad music for comfort now. But now these past few days I’ve been hopeless… the thought that I might be alone forever bc I feel like I gave up hope in humanity. &amp; I know a lot of people will say “you’re young still you’ll find someone” but no I mean I’m alone, I don’t talk to my family &amp; I have friends but I feel like I don’t have them, I just feel like I’m in this dark room where ppl can hear me but nobody hears me. Then random memories of the past that literally was killing me hit &amp; I just cried , I started losing hope &amp; started having 0 motivation to live, I don’t wanna keep going , &amp; I just wanna pack all my stuff just in case yk… I decided to do it, my roommates wouldn’t have to pack it for me.

I have experienced trauma in the past, but I feel like it’s not enough for me to be feeling this way now. It could have been way worse.

191lasu,Depression,2024-01-08,i’m very depressed and wish i had the willpower to end it all,"i know it’s a bit fucked up but although i’m suicidal, i also have a fear of death, so i don’t think i’d ever go through with it. I wish i fucking could, it’s exhausting continuing to exist.

I don’t think i’ve ever been happy for a long period of time… I think i have some highs when i’m with the people i love but immediately after i go through a decent back into my depressive state. My relationship with my parents suck and i think that has a lot to do with it. My dad is no long in my life and my mum she’s has uBPD. 

I’ve been feeling more depressed for a couple weeks now and I’m suicidal thoughts have increased and I tried reaching out for help by telling my mum that i’m not doing too good mentally, she just responded “ok” and that was it.

I know she has uBPD but i she was also once severely depressed and almost committed twice so i feel like she would have been able to get it, but she just is so emotionally unavailable and i think that’s the borderline.

I can’t speak to anyone else and my therapy is expensive so I have no idea what to do. I wish she would hear me, i wish she can be my mum and not treat me like a burden.

Recently i’ve been looking for a job and i got through with one but there are some red flags with it and because she works in HR at her company i kept voicing my concerns to her but she kept shutting me down and telling me this is what an adult does and i have no other option so i can’t be picky with what i’m getting. Then she went on to tell me that she sacrificed so much for me and i can’t seem to get that and i just get things too easily.

I don’t know what to do anymore i feel broken and hopeless i can’t shake this feeling and the one person i used to depend on is now making me feel like a burden."
191kur1,Depression,2024-01-08,I am unable to function,"As long as I remember I have been depressed since past 5 years. All of my college life went in depression, I never interacted with much people, couldn't find deep connections amd academic performance was so below average. 

I used to be a topper in my school, but in college I was barely passing any exams. I literally lost all my knowledge, and felt like the dumbest person ever.

Last year of my college I finally made friends, lost most of them but actually improved the quality of my life. I graduated and got a job by chance, though that job was not something which interested me at all. Recently I quit my job to study to switch to a field in which I might be interested and also coz my brain wasn't functioning, I was again going into deep depression and not able to do anything. 

I actually had done a lot last year, started going out by myself, traveling, interacting with people compared to how I am that's a lot, I started exercising, walking, cycling, going to gym. Also I started posting on social media, though this thing used to give me a lot of anxiety.

But lately I am not able to enjoy anything, I am not able to focus on my goals, do anything I liked to do. I started journaling, reading books, watching tv series, going for a walk, but nothing works, I don't like it even if I do it and now I have stopped putting any efforts and even if I try I am unable to concentrate and I feel extremely useless and hateful towards my brain. Its just I feel empty nowadays, its like I am just existing and don't feel anything. I don't know how long I can keep up like this. Last time when I got better I didn't knew this downfall was ahead. I overthink about everything I have done or anything someone has done to me. I know I should try to get better I just don't know how when taking a bath, washing my face and even brushing seems like such a big thing nowadays. 

I am just posting this to feel heard, its been a bit difficult and lonely lately. I hope to get better though."

I started to feel good this weekend i woke up in a good mood, spent time with my grandparents, then spent time with her then right before i fell alseep we got into this arguement then she broke the news to me, then she started to panic because she couldn’t have both of us, this just seems childish to me.

I am the type of person who won't speak to anyone unless they come forward , and in return , people think i am ignoring them . I get easily forgotten by everyone and don't hold a special place in anyone's heart. I was never in a relationship , coz no girl would come talk to me , which further increased my depression . Also being an academic failure brings down the weight of losing on my head . I also have only 3 friends whom I can talk with ,and only a singular friend amongst the three to with I can openly pour my heart out and speak . The worst part is getting ignored by everyone ."
191kljh,Depression,2024-01-08,Always late to work,"i picked up my first job ever right after graduating couple of months ago. And its a corporate job, pays well, everyone's chill, couldn't ask for more. Except i am always late. It started with me being 5 mins late at first and that was fine (they're very flexible) 

Till my coworker left for maternity leave and i was stuck doing all the work alone. I didn't like what i was doing, and i was doing too much and more than what i signed up for. Ive struggled with depression since uni and Being late was a regular habit of mine, depression just makes it 10x worse. 

Im now 2 hours late everyday to work. And before you call me lazy and other names. Its not that i wasnt trying to change, every morning i'd wake up in bed and force myself and my body to just sit up &amp; walk to the toilet. That task alone would take about an hour every single day. And trust me i tried to stop it. 
I also take a lot of sick leaves, like today. Today i emailed HR that i wasn't going to make it and they emailed me &amp; cc'd my boss a letter about my late habits. + they gave me a warning to sign. 


I never wanted to settle in this job. I cant do corporate and i was planning since day one, to quit around beginning of feb. 


And i will be quitting i just dont know when exactly. 

Im just scared of never finding a job. I love working its just the work process every single day takes so much from me i physically cannot move some days hence why i take so many day offs. I genuinely wouldn't be able to get out of bed the entire day. Suicidal thoughts are back and everything wrong in my life when its supposed to be right."

191e2ak,Depression,2024-01-08,I just realized this world is not for me and i need to be gone,"English is not my first language so expect to find mistakes in sentences.

I dont know where to start i have multiple personality disorders mixed with adhd,anxiety and learning difficulties i can tell im not made for this life where i have to work and corporate with people simply


 (also i have suspicions about having aspergers syndrome since im abnormally calm and cant understand situation mostly)


 And also addition of several severe traumatic events things are just getting harder to act forward vulnarable to addictions lazziness is just at its peak etc. 


I cant work in normal jobs because i employed to 4 jobs and all 4 of them did more damage to me especially the last job  since i got litelarry molested and threatened with getting stabbed 


Yes i standed up  against it and attempted to beat the guy failed  then quit job straight away but its just taken as a fucking joke so if i cant even defend myself how can i survive this world in long term??? Im not fat or skinny im kind of muscular i try to workout
Still getting bullied


I cant do most of my responsibilities because i have a toxic older sibling that got pride of lion with life of a sloth getting angry over staying in my room coming out of room or just trying to make me quit when i try to improve myself


At first i give a single thought what about toxic sloth says but later on the sloth starting arguments fights in the house to make it quit then boasting the peak when the sloth is in early 20s


As for my lovely mother who just provided and took responsibilities even though daddy gave up hope and left us she took care all of us she is just too passive about this situation and gets mad over at me because im incompentent and irresponsible


But mother cant understand whats the core problem is and thanks to my disorders i cant explain it because its really hard to translate it into a understandable conversation


So after looking at the past events and current situation im in (stuck in a room rotting away)  i have realized this world is not for me and i have to kill myself to escape it but i cant stop thinking about 2 things

1st how ugly ill look when they see my head has been blown up like a watermelon and juices coming out
 

2nd is i wonder if our senses still work after we die like can we still hear smell and see? Yes if body stops blood production itll completely lose its functionality but what about first hours of death can we still see things?? I still have many many suspicions


And also please dont give me the ""itll get better"" lesson because this is not a game where you are emotionless non aging character where you can enjoy the late game and chasing materials rest of your life

Instead after you sacrifice so much and emotionally drained out and got older the things you gotten so far dont make sense and meaningless"
191kaeo,Depression,2024-01-08,How do I find myself after being depressed?,"I am 20M. I have been extremely depressed for about a year now and have only been getting worse. It all began when I met a girl, we got along perfectly and ended up dating, we spoke of our future and our aspirations and decided we’d work hard to get there. Unfortunately, she became pregnant and unexpectedly decided to keep the child (despite previously talking of reaching goals above all, which I foolishly thought made us single minded), while I love her and wanted to support her and my child in any way possible, I also felt like fatherhood is getting in the way of my dreams. I no longer attend university, no longer am focused and no longer have motivation to work towards my dreams and I can’t help but blame her, but really myself for ending my future at such a young age. It’s a hard choice to make, my new family or my future, because I don’t think I can have both.

I feel as though I am no longer myself, because when I look back at memories from before depression I act completely difficult to how I do now. When I see friends I have to essentially act like I’m happy, I see them because acting like I’m happy does make me feel better for a bit, ironically. While I’m not suicidal too often, I do feel like changing up my name, my lifestyle, moving to a new country and maybe starting fresh. From a young age I was taught by my parents that success was the most important thing. I had always, therefore, held it extremely high in importance to me, thus this is potentially more difficult for me then others in the same position.

Does anyone have any ideas that might help with coping with this kind of depression? Should I just leave the things that make me depressed behind or will I ultimately end up more depressed?"
191ka4k,Depression,2024-01-08,Constantly afraid I'll never be loved,"I'm going to just start by say it, I'm a popular person. My social life is great (on paper).  I'm 25 about to turn 26, I have lots of friends, and a loving family. I have a fine arts degree and know people like interacting with me. People have told me im reliable and make them feel safe which is a core value to me... but I have never been in a relationship. This is painfully hard for me, as before I can remember, my main goal was to find a partner, and it never leaves the back of my mind...

Don't get me wrong, in my head this was ment to take steps. The idea was I'd have a girlfriend in highschool, learn the ropes to dating. Then maybe a couple more serious things during collage and university, normal stuff, right?... then I'd meet someone special and maybe get married? 

But now I'm halfway through my 20s and I'm quickly loosing hope and it's killing me inside... it's all I think about. I hate myself for being a virgin, I hate myself for all the girls I didn't kiss when given the chance. Every happy thought is eclipsed by this idea of 'no one will ever love you and your worthless' 

It also does not help that I feel I only ever truelly fell for one person... I think I have loved her for almost 7 years now... we almost dated when I was 17, but I missed my chance. We where close during university together but she had a partner. They broke up and I asked her out again at 22 and it just... didn't work out. I decided it was to difficult so I didn't hang out with her as much after that. then a few weeks ago I ran into her at my work and she said we should hang out and my heart just flourished...

And no one new has ever compared. No one had ever made me feel the same. If just never been interested or I try and force an attraction that just makes me not like them even more. 

I often feel sick when I think my university days should have been when i shined brightest. The days of meeting lots of people and dating and branching out going to bars etc, but when I was 19 I also got super fat and got pretty bad depression. It was not till at 23 I lost a bunch of the wight and got my first payed job. Only now have I really gotten a tone of my confidence and life back, but I recently broke my leg, and I'm putting the wight back on because I can't do anything, and I'm getting scared again that I won't ever be properly loved and will live my entire life not even feeling the embrace of another person. 

I don't want to get old and realise I wasted my life..."
191k86n,Depression,2024-01-08,I can't handle being alone anymore,"I can't take it anymore honestly. Constantly being a disappointment to any girl i try to talk to, always being told how I'm a pos and shouldn't even want a girlfriend, I'm supposed to be fine alone, supposed to provide, work for good enough salary to satisfy them, supposed to have a social life, friends and more. I can't do any of that, my anxiety is too damn high to handle people in big groups, like in college or work. The simple work that i have rn is not good enough for them. My goals in life don't align with money or career, so they don't care by default. No one cares about my personality traits of being honest, open, loyal, trying to make everyone laugh or listening to someone's problems and doing my best to give advice. No one fucking cares about me or anything im doing. Even if i hit my goals, they won't care. I don't know how to achieve anything if I'm still gonna be alone all the time, what even is the point in that? Everything is pointless, no one will ever care, i don't know what to do"
191k5rm,Depression,2024-01-08,I've let everyone down,"Exactly as the title says really ...

I've fucked the only chance I'll ever have to something that resembles a career because I was incapable. 

I've let everyone on my team down as I've just run away. 

Was touted as a high performer, now I'll not even be put forward for promotion. Everyone will outstrip me and I'll be left in the dust, as usual. 

I'm sick of putting my all into things and getting nothing back. What was the point of the last year if it's just ruined anything like a life I had left? 

I've got no friends outside work, so once I have to leave that will be it. I've got no parents. My ex was cruel and stole my summer from me. I live in a world so silent, even my whispers sound like screams. 

I just wish someone would just put me out of my misery. The meds don't work, the patronising CBT doesn't work. The only thing that will work is going for a nap and not waking up again."
191k2hm,Depression,2024-01-08,Why can’t I just die already,"It isn’t fair that I was born into this world I didn’t ask to be born. I get pissed off thinking that my mom was going to get an abortion but decided to have me.  Like why did you. And now I’m miserable it just isn’t fair now I have to either suffer living or I have to kill myself and cause others to suffer. Every night I hope I don’t wake up and die peacefully in my sleep. That sounds nice to not feel anything, to be nothing. I don’t deserve to live I’m worthless. I don’t want to be here. I don’t want to be here. I don’t want to be here. I don’t want to be here. I don’t want to be here. I want to die."

191jyf8,Depression,2024-01-08,"Genuinely, what's the point?","I've been generally low mood for about 3 years. From October last year to now, I've been going through my most severe depressive episode. I just don't see the point. The things I used to be interested in don't give me happiness, and I don't feel the need to go back to them, because I know it will be the same - I will feel nothing, and then feel depressed and more hopeless because I didn't enjoy it.

I know it sounds pretentious but the theory that intelligent people are more likely to be depressed has been running through my mind; I don't feel particularly emotional, in fact, I feel incredibly numb; I just look at the facts and come to the conclusion that life is shit.

But I also don't want to kill myself or hurt myself, because it wouldn't really change anything. Killing myself would cause more pain for myself and the people who pretend to care about me, since I'm numb. Self harm would draw attention to me, which I fucking hate, and maybe a stay in the psych ward, which probably wouldn't change anything.

I can't use psychedelics or recreational drugs to feel better because I'm a dumb fuck with no friends and wouldn't know how to get them. (And there's a chance it wouldn't affect or would negatively affect me)

I can't use depression medication because, where I live, I can't get prescribed until I'm 18 in April. Also, from what I've heard, medication doesn't make you happy, it stops you from feeling all emotion, which is pretty much where I am already.

People keep saying it'll get better, but I don't believe it. Again, not because I'm particularly emotional, but because of the state of politics, economics, my social life, my physical health, my neurodivergence, countless problems I am constantly overwhelmed by that I don't know where to begin solving.

I'm trying, as well. I'm trying to talk to more people, to develop social skills, but nobody worth talking to wants to reciprocate. I have been engaged and interested in learning for all my life, but it doesn't fucking matter because it doesn't make me happy in the short term (for more than a week at most) and any number of things could invalidate it in the long term.

In conclusion, I hate living but I don't want to die out of spite. I exist in my own personal Purgatory where nothing happens and I'm still afraid of change."
191jt3s,Depression,2024-01-08,Dont want to die because it would be a challenge for my family to burry me.,"I dont know where to start and even words that would describe how much I suffer. 

My family was displaced because of a conflict. Entire home vandalised and partially burnt. Survived ethnic cleansing. But with each passing day, its been getting worse. Being uprooted was like a start of our miserable life. 

Went through a break up. Still not over it. But have not been able to process it cause my sister had to undergo surgery twice after everything happened. Then I lost my job. The. Heard from my sister’s employer asking her to resign because she cant return to work on time because she asked for leave extension needed for radiation therapy. 

All family income lost. But rent has to be paid, we need to eat, we need to pay her treatment. 

I have been trying a lot finding work to no avail. It seems there’s no way out. Sometimes I feel we shouldn’t have survived. Because life is worse now. All of us should have died and we wouldnt have faced any of this."
191jntz,Depression,2024-01-08,I want to have a baby so I can have something to live for.,"I am 22f and I have had depression and anxiety all my life, and now I’m getting checked for bipolar disorder. I have thought a lot about having kids one day, and how I’m so conflicted, because I really want to have a child that I can give a better life than I have had (not that my life has been totally awful, but some parts I could have lived without).
At the same time I don’t wish my mental illness on anyone and I am just horrified by the thought of giving my depression and possibly bipolar to my children.

Anyways… last week I started getting nauseous and loss of appetite and I didn’t get my period… you know where this is going… I thought I was pregnant with the guy I’m seeing. 

And I have never felt such a shift in myself as I did when I realized I might actually be pregnant. I was immediately just ready to throw ALL my life away just to protect this baby. I felt for the first time that I could do something that would actually matter. All my needs were immediately put aside, because now, ALL my energy would go to this baby.

I felt for the first time ever that I had a purpose for continuing living and that my life’s work would be to provide the absolutely best life possible for this baby as I possibly can.

I started planning my every next step: ""I’m done with nursing school in 2 years, I will just do mostly at home studies while taking care of my child, then I will get a steady income, and after I have worked as a nurse for a while I will start medical school and become a doctor for a higher income. And it doesn’t matter if the baby-daddy wants nothing to do with me if I tell him I’m pregnant, or if he doesn’t have a steady income yet, I will raise and provide for this child alone if it’s the last thing I do. I will move to the countryside and have my sweet dad help me if theres any complications, I will give my baby a safe happy life far away from all evil in this life.""

But then I started bleeding yesterday… I kept hoping it was pregnancy spotting, but I already changed my tampon three times since yesterday. And now I feel so empty again. I feel like I lost something, I lost a life. I’m sorry if this is insensitive, but that’s how I felt.

And now I’m obviously thinking ""well at least now I don’t have to worry about my child having a miserable life with all kind of mental problems! You should be glad!"" 
But I just yearn for that feeling of MATTERING
Of DOING SOMETHING THAT MATTERS.
I don’t feel like that ever. Even though yes I love to ""take care of"" my parents when they are sick and people around me but it’s not the same sense of ACTUALLY MATTERING in life.

Has anyone had a similar experience with depression and pregnancy or any experience around this?"

191jgaq,Depression,2024-01-08,Am i depressed?,"(I’m sorry for any spelling mistakes this was written at 6 in the morning) About 2-3 months ago I started to hate myself because of the way I looked, smelled, smiled, laughed and talked. I felt like I never was enough for anyone and anytime I’d feel bad about myself I would feel terrible because there are others in this world that have it worse than me and I’m over here crying because I hate myself even though some other kids would kill to be me even for a day. Most of my peers are so confident and outgoing like I never was making me feel left behind so I sit in the back of every class and never say a word to anyone. This made my social anxiety worse and worse to the point of me feeling constant judged no matter where I am at either it be at family events, school. My friends house or just at home. I know I’m a failure as a son, student, boyfriend, cousin, brother, and the worst of all I’m a failure to myself. Due to all of this going all I basically have no energy in me to do anything else in the day leaving me rotting in bed most days and after school I just hop in bed and sleep or doom scroll on TikTok to distract myself from my own thoughts and feelings. Due to my feelings I have frequent thoughts of suicide and I’m pretty sure I have suicidal ideation but I know I’m never going to even hurt myself because if anyone cares they will end up sad but also because I’m a big pussy who couldn’t handle the pain of it all. In conclusion I think I’m depressed and have a ton of anxiety but I’m not that type of person to self diagnosed. Am I depressed or just sad?"
191jft6,Depression,2024-01-08,Everyone is better off without me,"I've tried multiple times and multiple ways of seeking friendships, relationships, genuine connections and I've just come to the conclusion that everyone is just better off without me. Everyone around at some point has always been able to tell me about the great experiences and moments of their life. I don't have that, I never have. I attempted in different ways, with different people both showing who I truly am and trying to fit it at all in any way I can, and just can't. I once was told ""You will never be anything in life"", ""you're one of those people I wouldn't invite to anything"" by my family. While in the meantime I'm simply just trying to find someone or anyone that I can connect with, even my family all just ask me how I'm doing for just routine purposes and proceeds to move on to something else to talk to and laugh to, to ask them for their opinions to share moments with after I tried my best to connect. I'm ugly, I don't relate to people, I can't connect with anyone. Everyone who I do end up talking too ends up hating me and just bashes me for who I am. My taste in music is different, my opinions are different, my choice in food and why I do and I don't like specific food is different. I don't relate to anyone. I told someone who asked me genuinely if I was okay in a group of people I was trying to make friends with, and I opened up to him telling him that they deserve a better person in their life than me because no matter how hard I truly tried, they just moved on from me and made fun of me saying ""sometimes you just dont fit in"" even my parents did and still do. All the people I've known the longest has done that to me. They make fun of me for the way I look, the way I speak, the way I think, the way I eat, the way I act, every action I do. My mother told me she wished she never had me and I wasn't planned, I asked my dad and he said the same. Everytime no matter how much enthusiastic and uplifting to others around me, they always make fun of me, criticize me. I've read self help books, I've talked to a psychiatrist, I've talked to other people with different opinions about this and they all just end up leaving me for their own sanity. Just like that, no explanations, no hey I'm sorry. Nothing, then they all come back around to tell me how great their life is and how happy they're, and after a certain point of dealing with these things I came up to the conclusion after decades of trying to find something, I finally have just accepted that the world has its happy people and sad people, the world has its people who have friends and family and the world has its people who have nothing and will never be nothing. The ying to a yang. I am that person, I don't think I am, I know I am. Everything I've wanted has never worked, no matter how hard I tried, no matter how disciplined for an extended period of time with no other goals or second options distractions, I just doesn't work out.. I will for ever be alone, people are legitimately better and happier with out me. I am a burden, I am thorn, I am that ugly duckling, I am me. I don't know when I will end this but ever since I was a little kid I've had premonitions of this. That I will get left behind. While everyone else smiles and lives their life. I am that person who people give thanks to for not being around. I am going to be for ever alone. I will never be anything in life."
191j3de,Depression,2024-01-08,I was famous ... and then I wasn't,"Rewind about a decade, and you'd find me in the heart of a wild journey. As a young rapper, I was more than just a local name – I was a burgeoning sensation. My city, even my country, was abuzz with my music. It felt like every corner I turned, there was love and support, a real sense of community rallying behind my beats and rhymes.  
But as they say, what goes up must come down. As my music began to shift, to dig deeper into the grittier and more authentic parts of life, the adoration started to wane. The same streets and faces that once cheered for me now seemed indifferent. It was a sobering lesson on the transient nature of fame – how quickly you can go from the nation's darling to just another artist trying to find his way.  
This stark contrast between adulation and anonymity hit me hard. I realized that my sense of self was entangled in public opinion. I was riding on the highs of approval and crashing with the lows of indifference. It was then that I started to look inward, seeking something more substantial than fleeting fame.  
In this pursuit, I found a guiding light in Gurudev, Paramahansa Vishwananda. His teachings weren't about gaining followers or fame. Instead, they were about peeling back the layers of ego and discovering the true essence of who I am – beyond the rapper, beyond the public figure, just me in my most authentic form.  
Gurudev's wisdom helped me see beyond the superficial layers of identity that society, fame, and even personal ambition had draped over me. It was like shedding a skin I didn't even realize I was wearing. Underneath all the noise, the labels, and the expectations, I found a connection to something deeper, something eternal.  
For anyone out there feeling lost, unsure of who you are beneath the accolades or the anonymity, I encourage you to explore Gurudev's teachings. It's more than just a spiritual journey; it's a homecoming to your true self, a self that's connected to a greater, more profound existence.  
So, take a look at the links below. It might just be the step you need to discover a version of yourself you've never truly met.  
Stay true, and remember, the journey to your true self is the most profound journey you'll ever undertake."

Its nearing the end of my 1st semester of college, everyday for the next three weeks we have exams and tests and stuff 

I didn't go today. The anxiety is crushing me. I have no energy. I wanna sleep forever. I have the pills. The only reason I didn't do anything to myself yet is cause I promised my mom

If I don't show up this week, or the next, I will probably fail under the amount of things I would have to catch up on

I could quit. This semester my mental health has been steadily going down and I am trying my best, but It's not enough.

I have a psychiatrist appointment next Thursday. But there are still so many days and so many things between now and then. I am so scared I can barely leave the house

 goint to school is fucking terrifying, but if I dont go this week or attend the online exam, it will cement my fate

I know it would not be the end of the world, and I could try again, but the anxiety are depression are telling me that I am nothing without this I don't deserve to live that I should just end myself

Im so scared I hate myself"
191atrw,Depression,2024-01-08,"I'm 28 - Everything Hurts, I'm Broke Financially, Physically, Mentally, And Spiritually - Where Do I Go From Here","Everyday, I wake up in this hole - a little bit less encouraged to crawl out. It's dark, deep, and damp, and the tips of my fingers are scathed from clawing on the walls and slipping. Every time I get close to the surface, I'm pulled back down by the shadows and demons that wish me to never escape. I've had my arms on the surface about to pull myself out into the light, but the same demons convince me I'm not ready and never will be. So, the tendrils of the shadows constrict my movement just as I'm about to taste freedom and they drown me once again in the darkness. Day after day, I fall into the pits of my agony as I battle the voices and images that pulse through my head. I'm tired. I'm ready to go. I feel like the only point of my existence is to suffer at this point.

The worst thing is that no one can help me, because I'm not willing to help myself. I'm completely aware of where my biggest pitfalls are, yet I don't have any motivation to care or find solutions for them, even if they're right in front of me. I've tried pills, therapy, out-patient, in-patient, but I've never followed through or gone far enough with them to have any lasting effect on me. How can I if my disabilities won't let me?

I'm diagnosed schizoaffective and autistic since 12, and as the days pass, I can feel myself slipping into complete insanity. It's terrifying. The hallucinations are one thing, but I've just about lost control of my thoughts and actions. I'm a prisoner watching myself act. This is a cry for help.

I'm constantly berated with impulsive and toxic thoughts and emotions - most of which are in the voices of other people - and I find it more and more difficult to even form the simplest of sentences or conversations anymore. Vocalizing myself has become the most difficult challenge in my life next to motivation, and it's made more difficult as my extreme TMJ causes me physical pain and stress when moving my jaw. How am I supposed to function in this world if I can barely speak?

I probably won't be able to walk soon either, because I have atrophy in my leg from shattering my knee years ago. I think it's developed into arthritis, but I'm not sure. All I know is that I've tried to exercise it and do stretching, but I feel like I'm making the degradation of my leg quicker by working out what little strength it has left. The doctor who did surgery on my knee says if it gets bad enough, I could lose my leg and there is a strong possibility I could die due to amputation.

Sure, it would probably be best to go get medical help about all this, but where do I even start... At this point, I can barely work, I don't have benefits, and I'm not making enough financially to pay for insurance for all the visits to all the physical therapists, psychiatrists, therapists, specialists, etc. that I need. My disabilities make it nearly impossible for me to do anything, and I'm stuck. I've applied for disability, but I just don't have enough history of my work being affected by my illnesses to earn anything. That's got me fucked up too, because I've always tried to tough it out no matter how difficult my illnesses made it, but now look where I'm at.

Just about completely disabled, crippled by my depression, barely any money coming in to pay for this California apartment let alone food and medical support, and I've no motivation to work or fix anything.

How does a person like me continue to live? You might say I get off on making excuses for myself, but put yourself in my shoes. I can barely think or make decisions for myself anymore thanks to my illnesses, and it was no trivial task to write all this out.

I try to talk to my family and friends about it, but I don't think any of them understand how serious it is because I'm still for-the-most-part cognitive. It just seems like they're just waiting for me to become completely disabled before stepping in and saying, 'You're fucked'. I'm fucked now, but I don't want to worry or be a burden to anyone, so I continue to fight and try to stay strong.

This world doesn't want me. It made that very clear when a group of high school kids just about killed me by jumping and beating the ever-loving shit out of me when I was 17. That's how I got my TMJ btw - when they fractured the entire left half of my face. I never got justice for that - the kids got away with almost killing me, just like the many times I've been attacked in my life. I've never been violent with anyone - why am I always a target for everyone else's violence? Is it because I'm a schizoaffective autistic non-binary dweeb?

I don't know. I'm not bitter at them or anything really at this point. I know where I'm at is my fault and because of the choices I've made. I'm just scared and waiting for the darkness to claim my soul and lay me to rest. I'm tired of this suffering. Most of my life has been a struggle and continues to be, and it seems like that's all the rest of my life is destined for at this point. What's the point of living a life where you're just meant to suffer.. it's been so long since I've tasted true happiness. I can't remember a time I was truly happy after I turned 11 and realized that we are all alone in this world.

1919rxr,Depression,2024-01-08,I Got Harassed At My Job Nonstop For Four Months and No One Cared,"Back in 2020, I was working at a big box store. It wasn't the best job in the world but it wasn't awful. One of the floor leads had a bit of a reputation for being a bully, but I had never had any issue with her. I knew she didn't like a couple of our coworkers, but I didn't find out why (or how she had bullied them) until later.

So Covid hits and I get put on leave. Eventually, I get called back and things seem fine at first. Customers are a little worse, but mostly everything's okay. But then something changes with the floor lead. She wouldn't speak to me, even if it was store related - one time we had known shoplifters on the floor and I told her and she just ignored me. She went out of her way to come up to the register when I needed help (like if I shortchanged someone) so she could yell at me. She sabotaged displays I worked on and sales I made. She was, I was later told, relentlessly trash-talking me to everyone in the store. I also found out some of the ways she had previously bullied other store members. She had spread a legally slanderous rumor about a coworker; corporate had actually stepped in and told her to stop, though why they didn't fire her is beyond me. She had left a nasty, deeply personal one-star review on a coworker's online store page, despite the fact she had never used his product. Corporate had also told her not to do that. Given the awful things she said about these two, I just can't get out of my head what she might have said about me.

And the thing is: nothing triggered this. There was no fight or conflict. I've been in conflicts where I know what the cause was, and there's nothing here. I got hit just for existing.And somehow, despite the fact that it was known how shitty she was to people, no one really cared when it happened to me. I complained to our boss and HR about it, she didn't even get a slap on the wrist. After I quit, another coworker complained and she was officially reprimanded and had to apologize to him. And then, about a year later, I went into the store, and the two people on duty who I knew spent the entire time I was there actively avoiding me. It was like I was a leper. I have no idea what I possibly could've done, but they'd even blocked me on socials. It really fucking hurt.

I got bullied a lot in high school. I even got bullied some in college. My entire life I have been trying to get to a place where I can't be bullied. I thought after I graduated that I wouldn't have to deal with it anymore and it's never stopped. No matter what I do, no matter what situation I'm in, people end up turning against me. I post something innocuous online, something I think people generally agree with - I get dogpiled. My sister screams at me until our house shakes and I'm to blame. A coworker runs shouting up and down the halls about how I'm bad at my job and we need to have an emergency meeting about it - the person I complain about it to just rats me out to her. Someone is nasty to me, whether I'm nasty back, I try to use conflict resolution strategies, I go to HR, I ignore them - it's always my fault. I always make the wrong choice. I've gone to a lot of therapists, and I'm just like: how am I supposed to get better when the world legitimately seems dead-set against me? I can't ""better-but-believable"" myself out of intrusive, depressive thoughts when they keep getting confirmed. And I can't stop thinking about this sort of stuff. It's on my mind constantly. I've had a tension knot in my stomach for the past decade, and it just keeps getting worse."
191i30y,Depression,2024-01-08,What is the point anymore?,"I 27(M) have been depressed for as long as I can remember. I don't really know when it started but I would say around 4-5th grade. As soon as I had the ability to reflect upon myself I have always found myself to be a failure who is not good at anything he does. I don't remember why exactly I think this way I just always have. I've always hid this from everyone I've ever spoke to including family and friends. I've never been able to have any sort of meaningful relationship with anyone. With friends I eventually cut myself out of their lives so that I am not a bother to them. When it comes to romantic stuff. I've never seen the point since whoever was with me would eventually leave because i'm a failure anyway so what would be the point in even trying. So now ever since I bought my own place when I was 25 All I do is stay home all day everyday by myself. I work from home so I don't have to bother people in a office. I either order food, go to drive throughs, or order groceries to be delivered. I have basically created my own jail cell where I am waiting for my life to end by myself so I won't be a bother to anyone again. I can normally get over the being a failure stuff at least to a degree that I can function in my job so I don't lose my income. But I have no idea how to get over the loneliness that comes with being who I am and the way I live my life. I haven't seen the point in life since grade school but always kept going through the motions to not be a burden to others. this new loneliness I have become accustomed to is very dark and deep that I am starting to see me even being alive as a burden. Not to others but to myself. I don't really know how to shake this feeling.  

My family convinced me to go to a doctor about a month ago for the first time in about 10 years. They started me on some anti depressants. I've been taking them for about 3 weeks but the only change I can see is that my thought process isn't as clear as it used to be. I have the same feelings (self doubt/worth issues) but now the words won't come to me while im trying to talk myself through them. It's almost more painful this way than to just being able to say them to myself and move on to the next thought. I know feel as though I have to try extremely hard to get the actual words happen in my head. like the feeling is still there but the words associated with it are not there. So then I start to focus on it. A lot. so when I finally do break through this fogginess the words are much louder and much more harsh than they were in the past. I don't know what to do anymore. I don't want to die but I can't say I really see the point in trying this hard when im this alone. I have no one that ""needs"" me. I'm not really sure how to end this but if you made it this far maybe you understand this better than I do. I'm not going to ask for anyone's help with this but if someone could explain this that has a better understanding that would be nice. 

PS.   
I'm not in any danger of intentionally taking my own life. I'm too much of a coward. "
191hvmw,Depression,2024-01-08,It’s been months since she broke up with me and the hole in my heart continues to grow with every waking second,"Over my life, I’ve sought love relentlessly but things have never really worked out. The first time I fell in love I got the courage to ask her out I was met with a simple “oh” and she never talked to me again. The second time ended with me in a courtroom with six months of probation. The third time ended with me in a mental hospital where I was nearly beat to death. The fourth time she ended up dating a good buddy of mine. Then, I fell back in love with the second girl and kept on trying to get her over and over again for 3 years straight. I eventually came to terms with things and accepted that I’ll never have her. It took a while but I recovered and shortly after I met a new girl. She was different though. She was the most beautiful girl I’d ever seen. Her voice was perfect, her personality was perfect, every little thing about her was perfect. I instantly fell in love. She was a dancer for a basketball team and I went to all her games. I was socially awkward though because my mind is fractured from a concussion I suffered during the previously mentioned mental hospital experience in which I was attacked by another patient and nearly beat to death. I can’t communicate with people very well. The reason I can only text is because on the phone I don’t have to look anyone in the eye and it’s a lot easier to dump my thoughts by typing them rather than speaking them. I eventually asked her out and she said yes. That was the happiest I’d ever been in life. For a time, at least. Then, the excitement of my success wore off and I still felt empty. I didn’t understand. I finally had what I wanted and nothing changed. But when I talked to her, all of that went away. She was so, so beautiful and sweet and just perfect. On Thanksgiving I sent her a text message about how thankful I was for her, it read the following.

“Hey, I’ve been wanting to say this for a while, and there ain’t no better day then thanksgiving to say it. I wanted to say that I am really thankful for you. You may not know it, but you have done so much for me and made a true difference and impact in my mental health and everyday life. You showed me that life can still be good when I had no hope by just being there. So, that being said, I’m thankful for you, and once again, I hope you have an amazing day and an amazing Thanksgiving”

I waited and waited for hours but I was met with no response. I then sent the following message.

“Hey, I’m assuming you haven’t gotten around to reading that last message, it’s been a while since I sent it. I’m not mad that you haven’t read it yet, I’m just a bit worried. You normally respond pretty quickly. Are you doing okay? You know I’m there for you, and although you don’t know about me yet, you know that I love you, so please, respond as soon as you can and let me know if you’re doing okay. I don’t want to put you in a position where you feel alone when I could’ve done something to prevent it, I overthink far too much for all that. Anyways, I’m assuming that you’re asleep by now, so goodmorning, I hope you had a good thanksgiving and I hope you have an amazing day today, and even if you don’t, then remember that tomorrow is another day and another day means another chance for success. And sorry for the long message”

Again, I waited and waited for a response and a day had gone by and still, nothing. The night of Black Friday, she sent me the following.

“Sorry I got my phone taken or I would have responded quicker Hey so I loved the message And it was rlly sweet and your honestly the sweetest and caring person I have met and your a great friend and you are gonna be a great bf but honestly I’m not mentally ready for a bf I tried I rlly did but I just can’t and I’m rlly sorry but I do wanna stay friends I just don’t want a bf rn”

I respect her choice but at the same time I can’t handle it. I don’t know how to feel. For a time, I tried to hate her to deal with the pain. I tried so, so hard to hate her with every fiber in my being but it didn’t work, I loved her too much. I had dreams about her every night and I still do. Not a moment passes where I don”t think about her. It doesn’t feel like the typical heartbreak though. I feel like I’m mourning her. It feels like she died. To me, she did, and she took all the best parts of me with her. I don’t know what the hell to do. I spend every night contemplating whether or not I should take my life. I almost did a few weeks ago. I was going to. I couldn’t find the gun. And I can’t even get help because I want to so bad but I’m an absolute egotistical narcissistic piece of shit. I can’t stand to be wrong and I’ll go to hell and back just to prove I’m right over the smallest argument so when people try to help me I find a way to disprove them and ultimately push them away. Now, I don’t have anyone to push away, which is why I’m posting this. I really need help. I’m feel like I’ve been hollowed out. I have so many voices in my head screaming at me all at once and I can’t focus on any single one of them. Every second I feel my sanity deteriorate even more. I going fucking insane. All I want to do is lay on the floor and cry my eyes out but no matter how hard I try, I can’t cry because I have no more tears left to shed. Please help."
191hrxa,Depression,2024-01-08,Slowly losing it again after getting better [tw:heavy topics] (vent),"I (m18) was in a really bad place in 2020/2021. I was severely suicidal. I had no friends and due to the pandemic i had almost no human contact for over a year. Its been getting better in 2022, but then my mother died in February. I wasnt even 18 at the time. Ive just been thinking of all the things i wanted to tell her.i missed my chance to tell her that i am bisexual. I feel like i hid a part of me and now its too late to show her. Everyone thinks ive moved on, but in reality im just bottling it all up. Ive been thinking about sh again after 3 years clean and about suicide aswell (my first and only attempt was just before my birthday in September 2020). My substance abuse issues came back right as my mother died. Ive been getting into worse and worse stuff, even things i promised myself i wouldn't take. Im breaking my owm boundaries. I dont have anyone to talk to about it. I found new friends, good friends even and a best friend aswell, but i still feel so alone. Im also not sure if my friends would continue being my friends if they knew that i was bisexual/gay (still figuring it out). They made some bad comments about bisexual people recently and generally have nothing good to say about lgbt. Im just so tired, i cant talk about these issues in person. I dont know what to do."
191hrb7,Depression,2024-01-08,I don't know where or how to be happy anymore?,"More often than not, I'm unhappy/depressed. Exhausted. 

Three months ago I moved to Australia from the UK, in general my depression and pmdd have been tonnes better but I still feel like crap a lot of the time and don't know if I'm happy. 

I'm back to working full-time after working for myself for years due to full-time not suiting me due to exhaustion from my blood disorder so now I'm in a new country and just exhausted all of the time so can't make the most of my time off. 

Dating sucks too, I feel more undesirable in this country and that any dates I have been on they seem quite disappointed by the way I look when I turn up and generally don't contact again. 

I feel like the last time I was truly happy was partially living with my ex in the UK, he had a lovely house and worked away 5 weeks at a time and was back for 5 weeks, our relationship ended due to his fickleness but I was pretty content with the life we had. Close to that was how happy I was dating the last person in the UK because of how much we made eachother laugh but unfortunately that wasnt long lasting either. Knowing I'll not afford my own comfy space anytime soon even with savings also makes me feel horrendous. What even am I working and being exhausted for? 

I'd mentioned to my aunt that maybe I'd feel better about my life and exhaustion if when I got home I had someone to share my life with like she does with her kids and like other people do with partners. But it's just not that simple. Also, I'm living in a share house with 4 other people. Generally they're all great except the guy directly next door to me who's loud, obnoxious and inconsiderate. 

I was close to giving up in the UK, struggling with my depression big time before I came out her but at least I was comfortable in the UK. I knew the area and had friends that I could arrange things with. I have friends here but feel I need more. 

I just don't know what to do to be happy. Or where to be happy. 

I didn't mean to write such an essay 🤷‍♀️

Tldr: 33F moved from the UK to Australia, haven't a clue how or where to be happy anymore. Any advice or empathetic wisdom would be greatly appreciated."

191he5m,Depression,2024-01-08,"I’m 22, fucked in the head, and don’t know how to cope with it","TW—- RAPE, SELF HARM


Hi, strangers. I don’t really know how to start this out.
I’ve had some sort of sadness or anxiety my whole life. The first time i was diagnosed with anything was at 16, after i chickened out sawing into my arm with a shaving razor i melted down with a lighter. I had been raped the thanksgiving before, was suffering from major PTSD and was skipping school the majority of my senior year. My mom made me start therapy after that trip to the ER for stitches. 
I’ve always had issues with relying completely on boyfriends throughout my teens, even now - and my only shit excuse is that I didn’t have stability growing up. My father was (and still is) an addict and a narcissist abuser who destroyed my mother. I know he was fucked in the head as well, because he would get drunk and tell me about it. He would tell me what made him want to be violent. He would tell me about everything in his life, like i was his best friend. I remember so often he’d tell me he’d always wanted a daughter and was so sick of having boys, and that when he did with my mom it was like a miracle. I was told in excruciating detail about how his second wife, after my mother, would sexually and mentally abuse him. How me and my little brother were the only reason he hadn’t killed himself yet, and then in the same breath ask me to move across the country to live with him. Even though it still haunts me to this day, I’m kind of glad he might me getting what he deserves still after all these years, as messed up as that is. It makes me feel like karma might be real, cosmic justice has all of our backs. But deep down I know that’s not true. 
After our visits, we wouldn’t hear from him. On the off chance he decided he was up for a Skype - we were being babysat by family while my mom worked two jobs, at school, sports, with friends - it never worked out. When it did, it was always how much he missed us and everything he had going on in his life that was so much better than ours. How if we ever wanted to move in with him and the final wife, we were more than welcome. 
But as I moved to my teen years, I started to struggle more. I wanted to talk to my dad about it. When those off chance Skype calls did happen, it seemed to turn into a competition for him. He’d tell me God was holding his hand and helping him through it for me and my brother. Ask me if I put any thought into moving in with him again, even if it was just me. No little brother. 
By high school, I had stopped wanting to tell him about it. He had made me feel like my mother was cold and never understood him. I think I never tried to reach out to her because why would she want to hear about me, while dealing with the burden of supporting two kids with late child support?
I turned to drugs of all kinds and alcohol at the age of fourteen with my first boyfriend. I’d met him in math class. He was cute and weird and always smiling. But his life was fucked up too.
Soon after we started into drugs to cope together, he became addicted to benzodiazepines. Our abuse of psychedelics while so young definitely intensified what I thought was a very deep connection. He was my first and i was completely convinced he was my last. 
I was still talking to my dad at that point - holidays and maybe once every two months. My grades were fine, my brother was still young and cluelessly un effected by our upbringing, so my mom had nothing to tell - she would refuse to speak to him unless he decided it was his holiday. Every time the trade off would happen since their split when I was 6, he would tell her how much he missed her and sometimes push it far enough to ask for a hug. Then we’d either go spend time with him and his final wife, or he’d leave to go back home to his wonderful life. Not to be heard from for at least two or three months by the time i was a teen - which he would get upset about. It would be my fault for not reaching out. I’d talk to him if I wanted to. which, in hindsight, true shit. 
My boyfriend liked my dad, they met on one of his visits when we had only been together about a month. I had already started to fall into a marijuana dependency pretty heavily. 
Now, after an ugly fallout and an abortion with my high school sweethearts child, being raped by a childhood friend, and falling for a good guy who has had enough of my damage, I no longer see the point. 
I’ll probably come back to this later. Maybe it’ll turn into  fucking novel."
191he2m,Depression,2024-01-08,I shouldn’t feel so alone,"I’m 17 male turning 18 in a few months, senior in high school, grades are good should get into a decent college, I have close friends, I have family, I’m not ugly, I’m a little skinny, I have passions, I play guitar and I like to sing and write songs, I wanna be in a band one day, bad people like me. But I don’t feel connected to anything I have. I feel privileged comparing myself to some of the post on here but I can’t find anything meaningful in my life right now. When I was 16 I was hit by a car and feel like ever since then I’ve been sad. Even when I had so much support around me. In some ways I feel like I’ve been dead ever since that car struck me and I can’t stop thinking about what my life would be like if it didn’t happen. I used to have a lot anger when I younger but now it’s just sadness and melancholy. I’m literally up at 4am when I have school tomorrow because I can’t sleep anymore. I was looking at my song lyrics and it just seems like the pain I feel will never understood. I always wanted to use my music to help people but I don’t know if I’ll make it that far."
191hbbd,Depression,2024-01-08,How long can stories be? I just had a lot to put out and couldn’t get rid of anything. Please read,"(I tried starting this as maybe some advice or something, I just wanted to try and help but it turned around into whatever this is, I just need someone to read this and just say… anything)

Anxiety…Depression…Stress

Nothing matters

You fall down a hole you can’t get out of

everything you thought about and cared about just disappears during a time like that. You lay there, Lifeless, Just thinking, and it doesn't end until your mind says “enough”

Sometimes your mind won’t even say “enough”

You might have lost someone close, lost a job, lost the love of your life… you’ve lost someone or maybe even something

Maybe it’s that you had a sudden realization about a topic and it’s been holding you back. No matter what the issue is… you’re still laying lifeless and lost

You might try bettering yourself which is a great option, possibly the gym? Finding love? Helping others? Maybe even just doing chores? 

At the end of the day you’re doing something and that’s great… but sometimes… that doesn’t even come close to helping… you still feel lost with nowhere to go.

Many people can feel this way… you’ve tried everything… some might even try to turn to a better life… a life that might consist of more people? Maybe religion? But still doesn’t help. 

This kind of feeling takes a long time to understand… maybe seeking a professional can help understand why or how you’re feeling this way and what to do… but many including myself hate that option.. for some reason

Maybe we don’t like talking about our issues… which is very unhealthy… but.. we just can’t handle bringing our issues onto others.. at least that’s how I feel about it.

The thing that helped me most and is still probably my biggest priority.. is striving for what I actually want or at least wanted in life… maybe like a bucket list

Get what you want done… for me… that’s making a film.. I’ve always had a deep understanding in film and feel like I could express the emotion needed… possibly create something others can watch and see themselves in the story

I’d like to use my ideas and create something that many can watch and feel a connection to… but often many times I think about that I feel like I’ll fail.

The only thing I “want” in life is love… but the way I am… yeah that’s not happening…
I’ve tried for 17 years… 

I know to focus on myself… I have been… I’ve lost weight, I’m achieving goals… but it’s not what I want. I could be the fattest man alive with no goals complete and still feel the same… 

my problem is I live a life with no love and a life achievement I can’t complete… of course there’s more to life then both of those… but it’s not what I care about… 

I live with a handful of mental issues that many people use against me. All together... they make me feel different than others

I’m not lost… yet I’m searching
I’m not alone… yet I feel alone
I’m not suicidal… yet I feel helpless

My point is maybe search for what you truly want, strive for your life goal. express yourself. you’re only here for so long… get what you want done

Anxiety…Depression…Stress

I feel like Nothing matters

I’ve fallen down a hole that I can’t get out of

I’m… lost

You’re lost with me… maybe

No matter what happens… the thing that comforts me the most… is knowing that I’m not alone"
191h798,Depression,2024-01-08,How can I help my partner who suffers with depression?,"We’re in our mid/late 20s and we’ve been together for 8 years. He has had severe depression the entire time we’ve been together and most of his life. I also had severe depression for a few years and was hospitalized twice for it. Thanks to a lot of therapy and life changes I am depression free and happy more often than not! I’ve encouraged my partner repeatedly to go to therapy too, but he hasn’t ever connected with a therapist and stops after a few sessions. He hasn’t had a ton of luck with medication and stops it quickly. 

After several years of being unemployed he’s now had a part time job for a year- which is great! He’s making progress on the obligations he has to fulfill, but it’s made him worse. 

I’m so grateful he doesn’t self harm or have suicidal ideation. But I just don’t know how to help him. I try to “be there” for him, but sometimes I don’t even know what that means. He likes physical touch and sex, but I can’t do that all the time. The only thing he wants to do is watch TV but I think it’s just a way to drown everything out. It’s also hard to run the house and work without his help. He only wants to be around me. He ignores his family and doesn’t have any friends. He’s such a good person and a charismatic guy, but he has no interest in relationships outside of me. He doesn’t really communicate other than saying that he’s sad and anxious.

How can I help him? What should I do?"
191h6if,Depression,2024-01-08,Hope for the hopeless,I became a psych nurse at a psych hospital recently and I just want to say I hurts my heart how many people on here are suffering. I care so much about my patients and their journey to recovery. I know there are a lot of nurses that are not nice and don’t care about the patients but I do. And I’m sure that a lot of people have had bad experiences in psych facilities and I’m so sorry. But I want to say for all the people posting they want to give up. DONT! Your brain has a way of tricking you into tricking into thinking that this is it and there’s no hope left. But there truly is. Please reach out to a therapist/doctor/family/friend/anyone! I know people are scared when it comes to medication but I can be life changing (under medical supervision) . And one day you might be saving someone else and telling them not to give up. I have anxiety and I didn’t even think I could be a nurse and here I am in one of the most stressful jobs but I love it and I go to work so happy to actually help people. To anyone reading this I’m so proud of you for just getting to one more day I know how hard it can be trust me. Some days I get home from work and I just want to cry because of how sad I am seeing how broken the system is or people are. But don’t give up the most broken people are the most beautiful people and you can change the world because you have been there! I hope someone reads this. :)

191gx19,Depression,2024-01-08,Just venting a little I guess...,"Being depressed is obviously, well...quite a downer, but in a way its comforting. It’s comforting when you feel like you see the world in a way that seems authentic and don’t feel the need to be involved in the unending search for a purpose or meaning in your life. On those days when I don’t feel the weight of depression and I feel “more myself”, I get lost in that feeling that I don’t quite know how to explain. But the thing is, as soon as I fall back in to depression, I look back at that feeling and simultaneously covet it and despise it. I covet the feeling because...well it feels good and you feel alive, like I could make something out of my life that will give me satisfaction. I despise it for many reasons. I despise it because it never lasts and it always comes crashing down in some form or another. I despise it because I realize that it doesn’t matter, and nothing matters. The feeling I despise always comes with a sense of self importance, and my world narrows as I run toward a self fulfilling achievement. Meanwhile, the depression is lonely and comes with an unending weight across my chest...filled with despair, self-loathing, constant irritability, and apathy. But with the negativity comes a sense of clarity and understanding. A clarity and understanding in myself and the world, however accurate it may or may not be.  
So while a part of me loathes the depression tugging away at me, a part of me wants to sink deeper into the depths of it. But it seems no matter what it is I want, I always am dragged back and forth between the depths of depression and whatever it is we call those days, weeks, or months that tend to defy the seemingly endless depression. And I think what I truly loathe the most, is the simple fact that no matter what I do, I cannot seem to keep my feet firmly in one frame of mind or the other...and instead am constantly ripped from one state to another.

191gw0a,Depression,2024-01-08,Want to go but cant do it,I wish my health would finally take me out so the suffering could end but there would be no blame or guilt. I don't want to leave my loved ones but the suffering persists. I just don't know what to do anymore or who to turn to. I want to relapse and self harm but I know that slippery slope all too well.
191gu3h,Depression,2024-01-08,I need to hear stories of recovery/transformation,"I've struggled with depression/anxiety since my early teen years and have just also been diagnosed with c-ptsd. I'm now 36 and since my late 20's I've been heavily isolating myself so much that this whole period has been a blur of pain and constant anguish. I used to play music and do a lot of shows throughout my 20's but couldn't handle being around the constant drinking and drug use so essentially had to cut off the majority of my social circle. That's a choice I can accept but I thought I'd be able to find new friends and build a support network but I haven't been able to get it together since.  

I always struggled with insomnia, attention issues and feeling insecure and have quit the last five times I've tried to study and upskill. I'm currently seeing two psychologists but I'm making no progress. Being in constant survival mode trying to navigate all the instability has left me with so much fear and uncertainty. I go to the gym, do walking meditation and eat right but just can't cut through the depression for long enough to make the changes needed to support my self and work towards a better life.

I just want to know if anyone has stories of turning things around for themselves? Or maybe you know someone who has?"
191gtr9,Depression,2024-01-08,This World Is Not A Blessing,"I really don't understand why I'm expected to be grateful for being born into this dimension. I wasn't being done any favors. I've literally been lonely my whole life. I've always tried to have intimate connections with people but I could never achieve the type of interactions I wanted. I just lost someone who I was friends with for a long time because she hurt my feelings. My other friend is two hours away and I don't have a car. I have another friend, but I'm in the USA and she lives in another country. The only boyfriend I've ever had abused TF out of me. I tried dating again a couple times after that, but unfortunately the guys that asked me out turned out to be creepy. So I'm not really inclined to go that route right now. 

My whole family has mental health issues. I suspect my dad is bipolar because he has strong mood swings, and when he's angry he becomes belligerent. He mentally and emotionally abused me for most of my childhood and into my teenage years, and a few of my adult years. My mom has depression, and she just sits in her room and has no social life. My grandfather has PTSD from serving in the Vietnam war and it has caused him to become somewhat unhinged because he never got it treated. My grandmother is depressed because my grandfather is financially abusing her and she can never get what she wants. My uncle is depressed because he can't afford to move away from his crazy parents. 

I've been diagnosed by multiple professionals all saying I'm depressed. In addition to that, I was recently diagnosed with ADHD, inattentive type. I'm 27 years old now. So basically I've been living my whole life on hard mode and never knew why. I also think I might be autistic, but I haven't been assessed yet. My grandparents don't believe my diagnosis and my mom doesn't understand the extent to which the ADHD impacts my mind. She says ""Bill Gates has ADHD and he's successful"". I'm just like ""Oh great, let me just magically come up with a product the whole world uses and become the richest woman in the world"". She thinks it's something that can just be brushed off. 

I don't belong on Earth. I'm a huge mistake. My mom should have either kept her legs closed or simply aborted me when my lousy father asked her to. I don't feel like I belong here because my brain is different, and I genuinely don't think I'm built to sustain life. It just feels like I was born with a childish mind because I just want to have fun. I'm only interested in doing fun things, but this world is not based off of that. It's based off of work. I've tried to get hired for things that would interest me but the employers have either said no or just flat out ignored me. Everything in this world costs money and the moment when you don't have enough of it you become homeless. Is this the type of world I'm supposed to be grateful for? I'm suffering and I never asked to be here. Literally my mom chose to keep me while KNOWING my father didn't want me because she was lonely. I asked her why she had me, and she said she wanted her own family because she was lonely. 

I wish I could climb inside a time machine and erase my existence. I just don't really want to be here. This world is not a place worth living in. Everyone is so afraid to go to hell, that they don't even realize they're already in it. Earth IS hell. It would have been better if I was never born at all. My life would have been perfectly fine if I was left to reside in the dimension that comes before this one. My soul is trapped in a flesh prison, that I didn't consent to. The only way to free my soul is to die, and I'm afraid to kill myself. If I botch it, I could end up worse. I don't like being here."
191gqu9,Depression,2024-01-08,i’m scared of life,"All I’ve ever known is depression and the constant urge of wanting to die. It’s exhausting. It’s exhausting because when life finally feels like it’s getting better, it only lasts for so long until I go back to where i’ve always been. I have every reason to be happy, but i’m not. I left regular school and started doing homeschool because I’m missing over 100 credits as a junior because I’ve been so depressed my whole life I can’t even do one fucking thing right, that being school. When I was a sophomore I abused drugs. I would go to school high and come back from school high. I loved it because it was like an escape from reality. I loved the feeling of not feeling anything for once. I’ll be a year sober in March. But the constant urge to relapse is so strong. 
I truly do hate drugs and what they do to you. I consider them to be a chronically depressed persons toxic best friend. I’ve attempted to take my life several times in the past. I once even ended up in the hospital. Oh how I wish I didn’t wake up. Dealing with existential crisis definitely doesn’t help my case either. Life doesn’t even feel real. I have a boyfriend I’ve been with for two years now. No matter how many hints I drop, i’ve never heard him say “Are you okay?”. What I would do to hear those words from him. It’s just been constant arguing with him recently which just makes everything worse. He’s the only thing keeping me here. I’m scared of what will happen if he decides to leave. God, please listen to me for once. Please help me."
191gpu2,Depression,2024-01-08,I am no one important,"I have come to the realization that I am not the “hero” of any story, let alone my own. I have had depression since high school, but it gets harder every year to see the next one. Now in my 30’s I just don’t see the point in continuing. I don’t even know why I continue to try to achieve my dreams. Finally got an interview for med school, and was promptly rejected. Ghosted from the rest, but I’m supposed to persevere. I asked someone out after a five year relationship, after careful probing if this person even liked me. They did not, despite being told differently. Oh well. I can quit life at any time I please. 

I’m just not worth anything. I am no one. Who cares? I’m not physically attractive and clearly not attractive in any personality metric with depression. I just do not have the stats for med school, nor do I have the personality either, apparently. I’m too broke to go back to school for anything else, not that I have a passion for anything else. I’m in debt, but it’s being taken care of slowly. 

I really believed that I was somebody. That everything would work out with faith and hard work. I would normally hate myself and be so angry, but now I just feel a calm acceptance that I am just a faceless worthless extra/NPC. I am just a supporting role at work doing chest compression on people already dead, or doing other menial tasks so the doctors and nurses can do the “real work”. 5 years of work in an ER uncredited, hard working, but for what? Nothing to show for myself at 32 except a dead end job, no prospects and dreams that are just dreams. I want all of this to end soon. I feel there is no reasoning that will ever change my mind. Hopefully all of this ends soon."

I can’t stop thinking about her and how much she means to me. We’re still talking as friends but the way it seems, there’s no chance on her end of wanting to get back together, and least not for a long while. She is an amazing person and makes me so happy, but I ruined the relationship by not being emotionally intelligent and unable to give great emotional support. Being without her has spiraled me way down and I just don’t know what to do, I’m losing hope for myself and for anything to get better.

191g7jh,Depression,2024-01-08,I'm on the verge of ruining my life,"Hi,

I (M26) started being depressed or sort of emotionally laid back when I was 10 when I lost my grandmother who raised me in order to avoir living with my parents. When she died, I went from boarding school to my dad, to my mom since shit went down every Time, I wasn't even unruly or difficult but my parents were such Fuck-ups that they Always found a way to weigh me down or abuse me emotionally. I was never enough to my dad and my mother has BPD and living with some useless asshole.
Anyhow, I survived, managed to have a successful education and to become a teacher.
The issue is that, even if I'm an extrovert, I tend to internalize and lack professionnal distance.
I get back home, get pissed off myself because I've sacrificed everything for a job that drags me intro the dirt. I've made several burnouts, it brought back a lot of internal issues and I feel fucking depressed and invisibilized because I can't afford to look weak in front of my fucking family.
As I'm writing, I just snoozed the hell of my alarms and skipped every call from work.
My credibility is ruined as I'm often late/on sick leave, and I don't want to talk to my colleagues as they will Say that I'm just a lazy fuck.
I've worked my arse off just to get laughed at by everyone
My life is a joke.
My girlfriend is worried and to be honest I don't want to tell her that I'm skipping work
I feel invisible 
My life is going straight to shit while everyone thinks I'm fine and I'm just overexaggerating everything."
191g21i,Depression,2024-01-08,I think it's almost my time to go,"I'm trying to accept life, accept that im entering adulthood. I have 24/7 DPDR (I don't feel real, nothing around me feels real) due to a traumatic event, it's almost been 2 years like this, and although I know my friends and bf and family care, I think that it's almost my time to give up. I just want to be okay, but since now it's been so long with just pain, bullying, being the school dropout, being the failure of the family, searching for reality, dealing with death in my family, having to let my childhood dog go today...I think I'm ready, but I'm unsure how to leave right, should I say something in advance? Should I hang out with them, pretend I'm fine, write my goodbyes to them individually and formally? Or should I just do it? I'm tired of my family, the only person who's ever loved me is my grandma, my mother and father have pushed me away since as far back as I can remember. I was always alone. I don't think they'd know that their failure died until they need something from me."
191fzy2,Depression,2024-01-08,I think being dead would solve all my problems.,"So, some people believe death is just like eternal sleep. I struggle with moderate anxiety and mild depression. Over the years, I’ve had a bunch of messed up shit happen to me.

First of all, I was taken away from my mom by social services because of her mental health issues. I was raised by other family and now they are dead, so I’m an adult orphan at 26.

I was in a car accident years ago. The couple said they were fine but turns out their back was injured. My insurance tried to settle and they refused them. Now, they’re suing me for over $50,000 in negligence. Last time I saw a quoted estimate, it was like $300,000. Even if I declare bankruptcy, I will still have to make years of payments to them. I’ve worked so hard to get to have a good career and the thought of paying them tens of thousands of dollars is so upsetting to me. I think about quitting my job and running away. And how I wouldnt owe anyone any payments if I were dead.

My job is good, it makes good money. But I don’t really enjoy it. But I also feel like everything is so expensive, I’d be making myself more unhappy if I left. And, with these people suing me, the more I make, the less having a percentage of my wages taken will impact me.

I dreamed of getting married since I was a little girl and I’ve never even had a boyfriend. I feel crippling loneliness sometimes and I wouldn’t be lonely if I were dead. Of course, I have friends who would miss me but I am not the number one person in anyone’s life. I’m not actually going to end it all. But, I get thoughts of doing it all the time. And I feel so exhausted by life and disappointed that it’s not what I thought it would be."
191fymf,Depression,2024-01-08,Feeling a bit hopeless,I’m a 22 year old woman and I feel like a failure. I have been studying physics for the past couple of years but my mental health has affected my grades. So I don’t have a good chance of getting an internship or placement. I’ve also never had a proper boyfriend because I suppose I’m introverted and I have been occupied with studying and trying to treat my issues. My friends have graduated and have jobs whereas I haven’t even finished my course. I also got acne recently which hasn’t helped my self-esteem.

191fv2p,Depression,2024-01-08,My life is slowly getting worse and worse,"First of all I am having a lot of issues with friends and family. All my friend are fake and I’ve been betrayed countless amounts of times in my life. But this year was the worst, so many people I used to trust have turnt their back against me. I am startling to feel like I am back to where I was 3 years ago, a depressed pre-teen who was trying to neglect their feelings and pretend to be happy. But unlike last time, I think I’ve hit actual depression. And when I say depression I mean I am actually depressed. I’ve lost all motivation and hope I once had when I was 13. 2 years ago I recovered from my depression and realized it was time for me to grow up and face all my problems without loosing hope. I didn’t know that life was gonna get worse, I didn’t know that my mom was gonna get treated worse and worse by my dad’s side of the family as time passed bye. I didn’t know that I’d hurt so many people without actually meaning to hurt them. I just wish I had somebody who would tell me that everything is gonna be okay. Instead of doing something productive all I do is jerk off to porn or play Fortnite. I just wish things would go back to being normal. I can’t form meaningful friendships or relationships anymore, I can’t look at girls the same anymore, I just don’t know what’s happening to me. Any advice would be appreciated but I can’t guarantee if it’s gonna work. "
191frk2,Depression,2024-01-08,Is there a reason to keep going?,"19 MtF here

I've had a recent suicide attempt, and ive started thinking about my life as a whole every single fuck up. and realised i cant remeber anything before i was 16

i was a husk a robot all i did was get up and go to school. that was it i never went out of my way to get friends or talk to anyone

all of my interest ive stolen from other people even my identiy  as a trans person im pretty sure i just stole from this person i liked, i dont think ive ever done something myself, everything ive done is becuase ive been told to, for a year all i did was work i turned my brain off compelety 

i dont think im a person like shouldnt i feeel something towards others? I c=only care about like 1 person at a time and i feel nothing most of the time. 

like im not even here that everyone is lying to me and when im gone it wont matter, as im not anything unique just a bunch of stolen bits in a trench coat

ive tried getting help but its all useless as the people around me like my father or mother dont care they dont belive in it and when i was in it o moved before anything was done, im not a good person im awful ive hurt people around me 

i dont know anymore i constantly under panic thinking something awful is going to happen because of how much i disosicate, i cant get meds i cant get help and i dont see the point in living for 20, 40, 60 years of this crap, just to do the same thing over and over again it doesnt make sense

&amp;#x200B;

the best i can compare this feeling too is a husk like im not really a person im not real, and none fo this is happening, ive never had much abition or a reason to want or do anything, so what am i here for? to fuck up and have bad luck? i guess. if i wasnt meant to be happy why should i keep going at all"

I want to have connections with people but it seems like people can't really stand me for very long. Everyone except for my best friend have abandoned me and maybe it's something I'm doing I don't know, I'm just tired of feeling like I have to constantly wear a mask when I'm around other people."

191fbk7,Depression,2024-01-08,"I Regret Giving Life a Second Chance, To Be Honest....","My story may be long or may be short but here it goes:

There was a point where I had totally given up on living and decided to allow myself one year to have as much fun as possible before killing myself. Nothing had been going well for me honestly because I was a graduate who got in debt because of thinking that the field of astronomy and astrophysics had job prospects in my home country (South Africa).

I tried to improve myself by going to the gym and making friends but it seems like I was just trying to punch above my weight due to me coming from a lower class.

I loved music - especially metal music because it carried me through hard times - but the only demographic that is into my interests are white people, so it felt like I was trying to fit in where I don't belong. I even got some snide remarks directed my way because of this.

Three years later, the only thing that changed is that I am a father to a child I was not prepared to have at all - I am stuck with taking care of my new responsibility.
 The constant search for jobs over the years has drained me to a point where I accepted that I monumentally shot myself in the foot when I decided to not follow through with my initial plan. I am left with regret and envy for the people who have access to guns. I wish I could end this sick game called life ASAP."

I haven't set any goals for the year but to lose weight. I haven't made progress on that because of situations happening this month already. 

I feel drained most of the time, laziness and a dopamine of loneliness. I'm 28 male, single all my life and I haven't had one relationship that lasted longer than 3 months. I struggle talking with women and I'm short.

I've never felt so depressed in my life until right now and it has me thinking about all the things that I try to keep off my mind.

I feel like my whole life has revolved around status and the ability the persevere. I lost my dad at 9 and since then closed my feelings and thoughts off to the world.
I can honestly say I’ve done a good job at all those things so far.. I have a great job and the people around me view me as the guy who can take a bullet and continue laugh about the comics in the paper. Tonight has been different, I’m in a moral dilemma with a romantic relationship, so I went to reach out for help from my friends. I didn’t get a response. I really need someone, and I have no one. I’m afraid of what my family might think because they are so pretentious and cold, plus my siblings look up to me for advice, so I cannot go to them without feeling like I might destroy their worlds. 
I quite literally have nobody who will understand the feelings I unlocked tonight, I’m a 24 year old man and I was crying loud enough for my apartment neighbors to hear. I haven’t done that since my father passed.
Where do I go from here? I have so many goals and ambitions in life that I would never take that away from myself, or put that on others. But I feel like I have no genuine connection in the world. I care about people more than anything yet I am completely out of touch with my own feelings.

 I dressed like an actual teen that day,but after I literally payed and waited the insults were ridiculous.I usually dress up more partially because this stuff,but I was at an animal shelter didnt to need to dress up.

Said he was running to his car quick,but stopped after seeing me &amp; immediately said he’ll take me.This after whispering something to me in passing about it( don’t know what),and said I looked to young.Then continued to joke like “You arent going to sprint out?”,and just kept going.Emphasized I Need an ID,commented “a Deal on Your Alcohol” after I used rewards.Didn’t even have the energy to think of a response it was so wild.

 Had a great day despite feeling like a zombie(an just exhausted)ended up talking &amp; helping a lot at my new volunteer job a bunch(which is huge because I have horrible anxiety days too).So I just wanted to celebrate after a rest day. I rarely drink. I also want to avoid this stuff,and my IDs picture isn’t great.And these random weird no it all older people are just so annoying.No idea why he thought a teen would patiently wait in line for small cheap wine bottles of all things with a legit ID picture of them with slighty smudged lipstick haha."

Instead I threw up for 24 hours and my mom thought I had a stomach bug. I didn't tell anyone what I did and no one knew til 3 weeks later my school counselor had done a follow up because I told a intern I was cutting myself 4 months prior. I admitted to my counselor that I tried and she asked me if she  called my mom would they take me to the hospital. I told her no, so I was taken by police go the hospital and committed for 2 weeks. When my mom arrived she was upset I never told her and I should have told her not my counselor because then we would have to be in the hospital and in this embarrassing situation. She went on about what she had to get down there to come see me and how much stress that this was putting on her. While committed my brother asked me during visiting, how do I like my summer camp. After I got out my whole family just kept being angry with my and how I was bothering them and how I was stressing them out. The second time I tried, I told my therapist the next week and i was sent the hospital again but wasnt committed. My brother took me that time and shamed me the whole way because all the stress I caused on them and how I was inconveniencing them. If i learned one thing from that experience was that if I wanted to succeed, then I was going to have to do it quietly and make sure I do it in a way I don't burden my family too much. I been extremely overweight my whole life. Eating is my way to cope atleast that is what they think. Eating and gaining is my way to slowly and almost unnoticeable way to finally succeed in what I want most in the world. To finally FINIALLY close my eyes and never wake up. To finally not feel this huge weight pulling me further and further down. To finally not feel like I have to always watch myself and what I say do and feel around people. To finally not feel like the burden I am on the world. I sit at 855 pounds and I still haven't gotten my forever sleep. How much longer do I have to wait? I don't want to wait much longer. When it finally comes everyone will think it was because of something to do with my weight. I will die not because I killed myself but because of something related to my weight. They are and will be none the wiser that I finally got my wish and i finally succeded. I can't be a burden, I can't be a problem. No one can stop me and no one knows that I never stopped trying. I just am taking a much long and quieter approach."
191ejo2,Depression,2024-01-08,I want a silent suicide,"I feel like I'm cursed and inevitably evil. I ruined lives, and no, I never sexually abused anyone, but my words have tormented people forever. I have always been tragically fated to be evil, and I am tired of masking these thoughts and feelings. Suffer from post psychotic trauma. I need intense therapy, but it can't save me. I am considering committing suicide because I can't deal with my intrusive thoughts that will genuinely hurt people. I am a burden to my family. 

No one asks for my help as I'm basically useless because I did it to myself. I will turn out like my father no matter how hard I try. I see his symptoms forming in my body and I can't fight it anymore.

Edit: I didn't expect the support, to be honest, and it's very appreciated. I thought I was gonna get downvoted for the way I am. It made me feel less like shit and I'm thankful for non-negative comments. I feel remorse for everything I've done and I try my best to improve"

What i want is to be fucking understood and not judged and for someone to tell me that I’m a human and I’m not worse than anybody else, and that I don’t have to be better than anybody else. And i’m sure you would say that in a heartbeat, but when you actually got to know me, you would take it all back. You dont know what I’ve done and thought. You don’t know the darkness in me.

Just turned 31 last Jan.6, 2024. I was so down that I wanted to kill myself. Sent a message to my bestfriend that I was having a breakdown but it didn't helped. He told me I was a coward for having thoughts. He told me I haven't tried living alone so why am I saying or feeling those stuffs. From there, I felt shittier. I felt more worthless. I just wanted someone to listen to me and not get judged. If he sees me as a coward, I don't know who to turn to anymore when I feel this way.

I don't want to spend every day of my life working just to be able to afford basic necessities. i feel like I'm too mentally ill to properly function in society and I don't know what to do about it.

I typically feel pretty good through out the day and I do a lot of things to distract my mind like listening to healing frequencies and going to the gym and running. It’s when I get bored that I begin to spiral down. When I’m not doing one of those things, I just crawl into bed and just lay there for hours on end. I know self love and self healing is a journey and it’s not gonna get better in a short time but why does it seem like it’s just getting worse when I’m doing all the right things ? I have been tricking myself into being happy whenever I get into these moods and it last for a little while but it doesn’t stay. What am I doing wrong ? I’ve tried feeling it all out and riding out the waves but they seem endless and I just end up crying and hating myself. It’s when I pretend I’m okay that I’m okay. I don’t want to pretend anymore. I just want to be genuinely happy and free. I started a new hobby (Judo) to distract myself more and have something I want to do. Playing video games and watching tv is just uninteresting. I plan on buying a guitar and teaching myself to play. What else can I do ? How do people fill in the gaps so they aren’t bored and start spiraling into depression? Any advice would be nice.

But still I can't seem to have any joy in living and don't see the point of making this continuous effort to fake happiness and will to live all the time.

It's even desperate sometimes because I shouldn't be complaining or feeling sad, but I just can't help it! I just don't see the point in living, don't feel joy from the things I've got. I am fucking sad everyday.

This deep sadness is sometimes stronger, other times it gets better for a couple months but it's always there.

I have never been to a therapist before, which I'm thinking of trying, but it's just hard to find someone who will understand my background and where I come from. I'm about to start school, and I'm scared this will affect my grades; I can't risk failing classes. I still miss him, but he cheated on me, so there's no way of getting back with him. But I keep waiting for his messages; I keep checking my notifications, thinking it's him texting me. But I guess he just moved on with his life like nothing happened, and I'm the one suffering here. All I do is lay in bed and do nothing, and I just be crying my eyes out all day. It's shocking for me because we had a healthy, fun relationship, and his cheating was out of nowhere and not expected.

My parents are hella low on money because of hospital bills, I’m trying to get better for them, I’m trying to get my grades up to get a job to help pay for stuff, but they don’t trust I’ll hold a job. Even when I have a short moment of happiness, it gets replaced with an intense just awful feeling. My whole body is covered in self harm scars, I feel so ugly for it, I can’t wear any kind of short things anymore without people staring (or feeling like they are). And people say you will feel better with age, but I’ve been seeing so many adults saying that it really doesn’t, I really don’t want to live long enough to become an adult.

I don’t want to die, but I don’t want to live anymore either. It’s a peculiar feeling of just being empty and indifferent to everything, but the emptiness feels suffocating. I know I’m not the only one who has went through this, but I’m the only one around me. I’m starting to lose people around me because of my depression and I know I can’t burden my friends and family with my negativity all the time. People are distancing themselves from me and the isolation isn’t helping.

I try to do things that should make me feel better, but they just end up making me feel worse. I get out of the house, I go to the park, coffee shop, bookstore, etc. I go out to be social, but I end up feeling like it was a mistake because I go into a deep depression afterwards. And nothing bad happens. 

Does anyone have any advice? I feel like I’ve tried the normal ideas of meds, therapy, support network, doing things you used to like. Nothing is making a difference. I’m scared this misery is never going to end and that I no longer know how to be happy."

191cqyw,Depression,2024-01-08,How do you motivate yourself to work after being sick?,"How do you motivate yourself to get better after being sick?

Hello. I was wondering if anyone in this group gets really down and depressed when you are sick and it makes your adhd lack of motivation worse. On 12/31, I caught a stomach bug that keeps lingering, although is slightly improving. I don’t have any motivation (I barely have any motivation when I’m feeling well). I live with my parents despite the fact that I am 25, and I do have other documented disabilities and medical conditions including type 1 diabetes and anxiety. I was also not diagnosed with adhd till about two years ago. Anyhow I’ve struggled my whole life due to disabilities. For the past 6 or so years I always got sick in the winter. Last year it was Covid. Now this year I have an internship that’s being sponsored by state vocational rehab at a start up. The company employees about 15-20 people and the job is remote. My boss has been very nice to me but I don’t think he fully understands people with disabilities. I haven’t worked since 12/22 because of the holiday and on 12/31 I came down with a stomach bug, so I wasn’t able to go back to work. I am still having lingering side effects a little bit and I still don’t have much of an appetite. My boss says that he works when he’s sick (less but still work) and I should too. I tried to tell him that It’s not my fault that I am immunocompromised and it’s not my fault that I got sick. He says any other employer may fire me because I’m not dependable. My mother says that she thinks that when I get sick I get very depressed and that isn’t a good way to work in the working world, and that I should try and force myself to work, and it will make me feel better but I don’t understand why I should try and force myself to work if I’m not feeling good. But also I’m wondering if my adhd and anxiety make me feel more sick to the point where I don’t want to go back to work or get better. 

If it helps I’m currently on adderall 10mg but I haven’t taken it while sick."

191cnbg,Depression,2024-01-08,Ghosted by yet another guy and I feel the depression coming on hard,"Dating at 31 is a lot harder than when I tried at 29. I spent about $130 on dating sites this past week and I’ve had almost no responses. Then there was a guy who checked all my boxes, attractive and seemed into me. We bantered for about two days and then I stopped getting responses. I’m trying so hard to not be the crazy girl sending text after text but I also feel like I’m going crazy.

I’m sad because I’m alone and I’m made even more miserable by dating apps. I’ve had even worst luck irl, it’s not easy being a stuttering fat girl. At least when I’m texting I can be witty and eloquent….

Last date I was on the guy said that I was too fat to seriously date but that he would still fuck me and that could lead to a serious relationship. After hanging out for hours and  making out with me, of course. We even made plans to get a hotel the next weekend before I came to my senses and said I wasn’t interested in that kind of relationship.

This latest guy really seemed so nice and we agreed on so many things we wanted out of a relationship. It really felt like finding a prince after so many frogs, guess he just had really good texting game.

And then there was another guy who had ghosted me about a year ago who suddenly started texting me again. We sent casual texts over about a month and then he asked me about my kid. I don’t have a kid. Turned out he meant to text a different woman with the same name as me. I didn’t know if I should laugh or cry over that one.

I feel completely unlovable and alone and I’m so afraid that’s just going to be my life. Put love down as just another way I’ve failed like my useless bachelor degree or failing a physical for a job 4 times or failing out of law school or the hefty amount of debt that’s always in the back of my mind from those failures.

And I’m about to be even more alone because most of my family is about to move hours away. I’m already so lonely that it’s eating away at my soul, I don’t know what I’m going to do if I lose them too."

I don't need a diploma for anything but a job. And I don't want a fucking job.

I don't wanna do anything. I'm not motivated about anything, nothing intrigues me, I don't want to turn one of my few hobbies into a job that will make me miserable &amp; wont even pay well.

I literally just don't want to do anything. I hate living in a capitalist society and I truly don't have any other option than to kill myself. I FUCKING hate this world and the people who run it.

I've talked to this with multiple people &amp; licensed therapists and nobody has a solution for me. They claim it's my depression but even when I'm not depressed I still have no desire to do anything.

I'm a human being and naturally I don't dream of fucking labor. I don't want to work and I hate that's the only option.

So what? I just become homeless or kill myself? Man fuck this world and everybody in it."

191bzg9,Depression,2024-01-08,Why can't I talk to new people?,"Hi Ladies and Gentlemen I'm a 14yr boy who always felt different everywhere I go at school it seems like I can't fit in with crowds or friend group it feels like I cant socially interact with my classmates because I can't hold up a conversation for more than 3-4 minutes. I feel constantly judged by the ""popular"" kids because I like to eat lunch alone listening to some music in a corner of the cafeteria eating my pb and J.  


I feel like I don't belong in this world for many reasons I see people living there best life in the years that im in (grade 9) going to parties and concerts with friends. Hooked up at partys with the beautiful woman and hitting there vapes. While little old me just sits at home playing 2K or star wars eating some jolly ranchers.  


I think down on myself pretty frequently I don't have any confidence talking to girls or meeting new friends. I feel like im constantly judged at the gym because I can only do 1/3 of what the buff guys at my school can do...  


I have a hoodie mindset once I go to school I put my hoodie on and I just don't talk with other people I just sit in the front of the class listening to my teacher ignoring almost everyone around me. When someone does come up to I usually shrug them off with ""Im going to be late to class"" or ""One sec"" The only time im at peace is when im with my schools soccer varsity team where despite me being 14yr I was able to find a spot on the team I always feel like I can be me there because no one really cares (my teamates are in gr 10-12) so I go the nickname ""Bubbles"" Idk why they say I have bubbly personality but I can conversate anywhere else is this bad or no?

What's the point anymore? I feel like I'd be better off just packing a bag and go out into the woods and just fully isolate til the end days. 
I don't even remember what feeling is like anymore I'm not happy, sad, angry just empty.

I don't even know what it means to live, I haven't done anything, or been able to ever could never afford it when I was growing up. And in adulthood even less so. I've always been viewed as the the kid/guy you just avoid cause he isn't fun. I'm boring I essentially have no personality anymore, I don't smile though I don't frown. And I feel like there's nothing I can do about it just doomed to be forced to the edge of any social circle forgotten about.

Is it time I just accept that I'll just be nothing to anyone?
What do I do?"

Every day I like to spend time with friends I made online, always hopping into a discord vc each day and having fun with them. Normally there is no harm in that, but I do it almost every day now and nothing else. I don't do any of my hobbies anymore, go outside, socialize, learn anything new or do anything to make myself proud . Hell, this is the reason I haven't even finished high school and I'm turning 20 this year. I'm done living like this, but I don't know how I could ever change. Every time I think I'm gonna change and I'm going to make it happen, in the end it never does and it always ends up leaving me at square one. I hate this so much and I hate myself for it. I do know why I live like this though, it's cause I'm scared of my own thoughts. Every time I'm alone with my own thoughts, I keep having suicidal thoughts and I'm scared of how extreme they will be. It's also why I have sleeping problems, I just can't get myself to be alone with my own thoughts. I feel like if my life stays the same like this forever, there is no other option than suicide. I want to change so badly, but it's so hard.               Every day I feel more and more I cannot do anything about this and I'm scared. I have no social life anymore other than my part-time job as a cashier. Last time I hanged out with someone was months ago and I have to beg to my mom to spend time with me. I do feel like going to school again, but I know focusing on school work is going to be hell for me and the fear of failure will haunt me again.

Darkness holds me close

My mind is trapped in a cold, dungeon

You brought a lot of positivity into my life

I miss the boy I fell for

I feel you slipping away from me, slowly

Thank you for giving me a chance at romance

Thank you for seeing me for the insecure, monster I am deep down

Thank you for holding me close at night

&amp;#x200B;

We near 30, yet our love is bright, young

My internal sadness eats me away

Yet, you do not know

I hope you see the beauty in paths

Our love is astronomical, uncollided

&amp;#x200B;

My mind is sucking into the black hole of ending it all

I will never forget the souls I had the privledge of knowing

In this plane of time

&amp;#x200B;

I hope you speak of me kindly

Like champagne bubbles kissing bathtubs, sort of warmth

Our passion fading into the circle of time

&amp;#x200B;

I will love you until the end of eternity, endlessly

You turned my heart into poetry

Words cascading off the page

Unrequited love bringing out masterpieces

Interpretation varies

Perhaps, one day you will understand

The thorn that stabs my broken heart

Love stories exist

Not all ending in exploding fireworks

A work of art falling apart

191ayiz,Depression,2024-01-08,Are there any downsides of just consulting an online psychologist from another country like Pakistan or India?,There are no available therapy appointments where I live in Europe and the typical American websites that get recommended on here are too expensive for me. I just found this Pakistani website where you can immediately get an appointment for like only $5 and all the psychologists there have master's degrees so I guess it should be legit. Has anyone here tried this? Almost sounds too good to be true.

Therapist has been condescending and non-understanding and I find myself drinking to feel some feelings, same with weed. It’s the only thing I feel ok when I’m doing, I’m afraid if I can’t feel anything when not doing any of that for a prolonged period I might do some horrific thing.

It's been less than a month since this happened and I'm still so hurt, I still have a hard time believing that I really got kicked...
Furthermore, now I'm worried because it took me a while to get a job and I'm afraid it will take me a while to get another one.

191aohe,Depression,2024-01-08,idk if I still have depression,"(sorry bad english) I just turned 18, had depression since 14 and don´t know what diagnosis I have anymore. I´m still on meds since my psychiatrist had to give me a lot and getting them all off would be a problem, the thing is, I don´t know what meds I´m taking and what they do, my parents confiscated them after a suicide attempt and ever since then they´ve kept the names and what do they do for me to not research them and find ways to kill myself. 

Things are definitely way better than when it all started, but I wouldn´t say I´m completely fine, still have panic attacks and mental breakdowns (in much less frequency) and sometimes feel extremely depressed, unmotivated or without any energy whatsoever. It´s been hard trying to adjust myself to society again and still have problems with it, I still can´t fully take care of myself and constantly need support or help, but I would say I´m getting better. My psychiatrist had once mentioned I had a lot of traits of BPD but never mentioned a diagnosis, essentially because I was too young and didn´t have my personality fully developed. He said it was still in a stage where it could be prevented from developing but we never did anything to actively prevent it, idk if I still present those traits since I´ve decided to not let those thoughts invade my head with possible but not certain diagnosis since they would confuse me a lot. 

I´m just tired, idk if to actively search a diagnosis since now I´m legally an ""adult"" or see other types of therapy. My therapist has helped me a lot but ultimately it was time that helped me with my depression and idk if thats okay. I say that bc I was able to get out of the environment that caused me harm but was still suffering the after effects and emotional injuries, I cried and screamed a lot of the pain and ended up just ""moving on"" from it, however it was mostly new problems arising that made me forget the previous ones and made it impossible to revisit them and heal them properly. Basically, I had to forcefully ""move on"" from my problems due to other problems arising resulting on those old problems never addressed properly.

I´m just existing, fully automated without a reason or purpose, I´ve accepted I won´t kill myself and will just suffer a lot in my life since I´m an extremely emotional person; pain will never get easier and it will hurt the same no matter how many years have passed. I´m not really excited or looking forward to my future, I just do things for the sake of doing them, I also basically lost any hope or motivation to ""fix"" myself, to thrive to get better other than being able to function like a normal human being, I´ve basically resigned myself from salvation and accepted the fact that I will always suffer. I know I said things are definitely better but they would never be fine, the pain will never go away for me. 

To put it briefly, I gave up on the idea of ever being fine, I don´t want to kill myself anymore and I don´t think about it, I´m just are extremely depressed, unmotivated, or without energy, can´t function in society fully, idk about a possible diagnosis of bpd and don´t know if my diagnosis of depression still holds meaning, I´m still on meds but I don´t even know what they do anymore.

191amuw,Depression,2024-01-08,"I'm so tired, and I want to disappear","I'm so fucking tired. I never feel enough for anyone no matter how hard I try. I hate that this feels like my life and I feel like nothing I do will matter in the end.

I help take care of my father. I have two older siblings - one is moved out and I barely speak with him since he's so busy. My other sibling, my sister, lives at home, but spends the night with their partner every other night so I'm the only child usually home. My sister's bedroom is upstairs and twice the size of mine. My bedroom is a box next to my father's on the first floor so I hear the arguments with my parents, smell his colostomy bags, listen to his snoring. I fucking hate it.

Today my dad called me into his room and asked what he can do to help my mother. It's sweet and I understand his intentions, but I'm too tired to make everyone else happy.

I have a partner, we want to move in together but their car has now broken down and I worry that'll impact us looking into places due to expenses. Sometimes I feel like I'm not enough for them anyway. They struggle with ADHD and are seeking therapy and on meds (which I'm very proud of for them), but texting can be horrible. It's been 2+ hours since we last texted (was about car breaking down) and it feels like if I don't make the effort, I don't exist. I'm not interesting enough.

I feel overlooked at work. I put my heart and soul into a project that did so well and received so little. In a yearly review of the company, the head of the company credited the project to my higher up and seemed to have no idea it was all my doing. I'm a woman in a male-dominate field and that fucking hurts. I'm told to do more projects that did as well but I feel no recognition nor monetary incentive to push myself. I love what I do and im proud of my efforts, it just doesn't feel like anyone else does.

It got so bad tonight I contacted suicide hotline. They were nice, but I hated that I had to lie to them. They told me i should reach out to support, but I can't. I don't want to burden people with this. Everyone in my life is going through shit and I can't be the problematic one being selfish.

I'm not okay, I don't know what to do anymore. Part of me just screams end it all but I think of my dog who snuggles in my bed when I'm gone and then rushes to greet me at the door when I come home. I often tell her she's my reason for living when I pet her. I don't think she knows how much she means to me.

But I'm still hurting, and I still feel so unwanted."
191al1a,Depression,2024-01-08,i thought i would feel better if i got diagnosed… well its not,"ive been struggling for quite a while now and my family encouraged me to get diagnosed. they booked me an appointment with a psychiatrist that my sister referred me to. i was nervous going into it but i basically just word vomited to the doctor hoping it would sound coherent. nothing much happened the first appointment so he asked to do another one. fast forward, the doctor asked the same things and id answer word vomiting again but this time he suggested to go on sertraline. the first few days were a bit shaky but i honestly think what im feeling right now is much than before. so my mom urged to get a medical certificate with my diagnosis on it. when i got it i thought i would feel validated that i actually have something going on but to me it just felt like another document that i had to submit for different things. it made me feel worse honestly. like why cant i have something worse to be diagnosed so that i actually think that i am in pain that i am suffering."
191ailk,Depression,2024-01-08,Days under the shadow of the dark tower,"TW for grief, death, loss.

I miss you.

I miss those days of music. Of games. Of art.

I miss the silence of no planes in the sky.

I miss the Punch Out. The dark tower. The crimson king atop his throne of skulls.

Days pass, things happen, emotions and thoughts and clouds and weeks, months and now years.

Days pass and I just go on. Missing you. 

I hear our song. I sing along. That's when I feel your presence so strongly. I'm terrified that if I listen to it too much it'll lose all meaning so I just keep it there in my regular rotation of songs and wait. It always comes around.

Sometimes it plays on the radio. I sing along. And I just go on missing you.

Did you meet my dad? My uncle? My friend Colin who just joined wherever you are now? Did you meet anyone you lost? Did you meet my nana? 

Are you really here when I feel you near? Or are you just a figment of an imagination desperate to see you again? To hear your voice, your laugh, your smile and your jokes?

I miss Left 4 Dead. The stupid LOTR map we spent weeks trying to beat. Oh how we laughed when we finally beat it only to realise it had no ending until we ran to the top of the tower and flung our characters off the roof to our demise.

That's painful to think about now. I haven't felt enjoyment from gaming since you left. I haven't played L4D since. Maybe I never will again.

I selfishly hope that you've had a hand in some of my fortunes, I selfishly continue to hope that you will find a way to help me now while I suffer. I just feel like I'm slowly, slowly drowning under the pressure. I have too many plates to keep spinning. I'm tired and I want to rest but I cannot. I just want a break. My confidence is shattered.

The cracks in my armour will never heal. While the world lived in terror and denial of the events of 2019/20/21 you lifted me, you sustained me. You took me to heights I never thought possible. You supported, encouraged, laughed with me. 

You saved me. I changed fundamentally as a person because of you.

This year I will turn 40. The same age as you when you left. I will eventually get older, you will be 40 forever. I wanted to lament getting older with you. 

The pain of loss mingles with the pain of aging which mingles with the pain I've carried for years. Every day brings some kind of pain. Mental or physical, often both. Pain reminds me I'm still alive. At least as far as I can even be sure I ""exist"".

And now the cracks deepen a little more every day. Who is the lucky one? Me because I get to live or you because you went somewhere I can't even imagine? Maybe just back to the eternal void of peace from whence we all came? Are neither of us lucky? Are we both? I don't know. All I know for sure is;

I miss you.
I miss you.
I miss you. 
I have missed you. I miss you now. I will go on missing you for the rest of my days.
I loved you then, I still love you. I will always love you.

One day, I'll get out there. To your final resting place. I will leave you something more permanent than flowers. A pretty rock or something. Something that will never wilt. Something that will outlive me. 

Until that time I simply have no choice but to carry on. To live for us both.

To miss you."

I was touching myself and thought that the person in the video looked like my girlfriends sister so I imagined it for that split second and realized it and stopped but in that moment I felt a weird sensation in my groin as if I was about to finish after I knew it was wrong but it happened as I was stopping even though I was in the action of stopping because I knew it was wrong. I don't know what to do anymore. I kept repeating the action to make sure it wasn't true but I cant get over that it happened in the first place. I didnt finish I just stopped. I only love my girlfriend but this is so fucked up I do not like my girlfriends sister I dont. I only love my girlfriend. Ive been dealing with thoughts lately but this is just too far.

19179la,Depression,2024-01-08,What happened?,"I've always had really bad anxiety and some depression, but about 3 weeks ago it started to get really bad. I started having a pain in my stomach and eventually started to worry it was cancer. I went to the er and they couldn't find anything and I thought I would start to feel better.  Then, I started to have other issues and pains and started believing I had all different kinds of cancers. It was very obsessive. I couldn't sleep and didn't eat for days.  All I did was cry, and then eventually got to where I couldn't stay awake. I didn't eat for about 3 or 4 days and now have been slowly being able to eat again. I feel a little more normal now, but I'm still extremely exhausted all day, still have random moments where I will start to panic and believe I'm dying again. Every day I feel like it's less and less, but the pain I was having is still happening and I'm afraid it'll happen again. 
I didn't do anything during the entire time of the extreme parts. I didn't use my phone or watch TV, I just sat and cried and rocked back and forth. All of my dreams were me dying. 
I still wake up every hour with my heart racing. My heart will randomly start racing even when I'm feeling more normal and it is really making it hard to recover because it makes me feel like I'm going to panic. Am I just not giving this enough time to recover from? 
I've always bounced back so quick, but I've never gone through anything is severe before. I want to do whatever I need to do to help myself heal from this, but the way it's still lingering is making it hard not to cycle in panic. 
I've always had health anxiety, but nothing like this. My whole family had to take off work because I couldn't even stand up. 
Sorry for the rambling, I just was wondering if anyone else has gone through anything like this and if so how long it took to recover, so maybe I can feel better about it taking a while."

Why do i keep doing these things? its comfortable to stay where i am right now, eating healthier or quitting porn or making new friends would push me out of my comfort zone and im too weak to subject myself to anything scary or new.

I'm still functional, as in i go to school and i am alive but the light has sort of gone out, i don't have any long term goals and every day im just getting older without building up to anything

im only 18 now but i can tell that if i dont change the way i live im gonna be like this forever and that thought terrifies me. i want to change but im such a weak person.. 

and i am pretty sure that if i:
- made friends
- ate healthier
- slept enough every night
- quit porn
- found some kinda long term goal
i would be happier, or at least less sad, but like.. for some reason i cant get there..


well yea thats it really, i've figured out the problem but i wont solve it cus im useless..... whats new"
191a3xh,Depression,2024-01-08,What to do,"Im depressed after leaving toxic relationship.
Im in ttauma therapy (EDMR). Winter is hard and I'm isolated here in foreign country.

I've been on Wellbutrin which gives me energy but I've been feeling so angry and i exploded on people (I did that before too but less).

Im just feeling so helpless if any meds can help. I tried several but it makes me overeat. 

I eat too much, have derealization issues, social anxiety and just feel angry or stress. 

I'm honestly tired of myself and how others and I hirt them too.
It's very difficult to change and I'm unhappy with my life."

When something happens to me. “Oh u brought on yourself. I can’t help u”. Everyone turns there back and punishes me even more. 

I always wanted someone to talk tooo. A safe place. The way people around me feel safe with me. I just feel so alone."

1919urp,Depression,2024-01-08,"Haha, I love being me.","(Inhaleeeeeeeee)

About a year ago, I finished my fourth round of therapy for depression and GAD, and had a prescription for antidepressant/anxiety meds, which seemed to help. A few months ago, I got tired of taking them, because I felt fine, and had a ton other meds to take. At an appointment with my GP, I was allowed to slowly reduce the dose, so naturally I decided to quit cold turkey. I am truly a genius.

Up until about a week ago, I felt fine, but during an assignment in school where a couple of students talked about depression, they started listing symptoms. I know how it sounds, but I realised that I’d experienced every single one from way before I quit the meds up until now.

The weird part about this is that I'd been feeling fine-ish (I don’t think I’ll ever feel absolutely, 100% happy again), and I don’t think anyone could’ve known what was happening.

This whole thing makes me fear that I might start not only hurting myself, but also those I love, and get bombarded with suicidal thoughts again.

My parents still don’t know, and I don’t know if I know, so I won’t be telling them about anything yet, simply because we have a lot going on. I can’t be bothered to talk to another so-called therapist who just diagnoses me with something I already knew I had, and puts me back on antidepressants.

TL;DR: I think I might still be depressed and I really don’t wanna bore people with this shit. Which is why I’m boring people with this shit."

1919trx,Depression,2024-01-08,Just realized I’m not doing anything to improve my situation as self sabotage.,"I’ve (19F)  been having a bad time due my circumstances since mid 2022. Things got unbearable. I experience de realization often. 
Currently, if I try I can make my situation better but I feel incapable of doing it. Maybe even the littlest thing would help like talking to my parents (my parents care about me and they can make my situation better) ..but I’m not able to.
I feel like I purposely want things to get worse and worse for me. 
This realization was very uncomfortable and I don’t know what to do.
The things that have happened to me aren’t even that bad, but I feel terrible.

The way it would feel physically to be run over by a bus, it feels like that but emotionally. Like my mental health has been ran over and crushed and irreparable.

I have constant thoughts which I try to shut down by consuming media. But the SECOND, I’m left alone to think, I immediately cry. Even the littlest things make me cry. 

Opening up to people makes me feel extremely guilty. I told my boyfriend about my feelings a little bit,and I felt guilty the entire day for making him worry like that for me."
1919ooh,Depression,2024-01-08,I just want to turn my life around,"Early Years

Hello Reddit. First time posting here. To start, I’m a 21 year old male from Pennsylvania, turning 22 next month, and basically the title explains it all. I was diagnosed with ADHD at a very early stage of my education, and missed out on a lot of good childhood moments due to my behavior. I was put on the wrong medication in 1st grade and it caused me to always have meltdowns in class, eventually forcing them to send me to a special school shortly after starting 2nd grade. I was always a smart kid and always got good grades, but was unable to control my anger/emotions. And because of this, I had very few friends as a kid. I did not return to my home school until halfway through 4th grade. While my behavior got a little bit better during that time, my grades/study habits began to decline during my middle school years. Despite this, I still knew how capable I was of improving myself and promised to do a lot better in High School.

High School

During the summer before starting my freshman year, my parents convinced me to apply to the trade/tech school in which my high school provided as an alternative, but I refused to because I knew that some students who picked on me in middle school were planning on attending there. The first few months of high school went well, and I thought things were finally starting to go my way. Until an argument with another student before Christmas break cause me to be suspended for a few days. Even though I never got into any big trouble for my last 3 years of high school, everything else went completely downhill. I tried my best to make more friends and make people laugh, but instead made a total fool out of myself. My classmates would always just tell me to go away or call me annoying when I tried starting a conversation with them. I never took part in any high school events and never joined any clubs or sports because I was never invited to do anything with my classmates, and they never stuck up for me despite all of my issues. I just went home from school every day and watched YouTube videos and played games on my tablet or phone. I graduated high school with a 2.6 GPA and nothing to put on my transcript, while I knew I was always capable of being at the top of my class, and now I beat myself up everyday for it.

Post High School 

Since graduating and starting my adult life during the pandemic, I have come and gone through 4 different jobs in less than 4 years. And am currently searching for a new job. I quit my last job a week before Christmas without putting in my 2 weeks notice and have been unemployed ever since, aside from doing under the table work twice last week to make a couple extra bucks. I really wanted to leave on better terms, but I got so tired of the management and not getting enough help in my department, and did not go back after my last day. Since then, I have been applying to multiple jobs, probably like 20-30 different places, but still have not be hired by anybody. I was also ghosted by a girl who showed lots of interest in me at first on Christmas Day because she did not like my choice of words apparently, I have never been in a relationship due to my issues with ADHD. I still sent her a very long and heartfelt message explaining my situation and promised to be better moving forward. She eventually got back to me saying she was still upset but would get back to me, and just needed more time. I began to feel signs of hope again, until NYE when I was going to wish her Happy New Year. I noticed she changed her pfp to her with another guy. I had a complete mental breakdown and my whole night was ruined. Thankfully my true friends at the party with me were there to comfort me. 

Conclusion 

Sometime in early 2022, I saw the direction I was heading in life and started giving myself more meaning. I started going out more, making new friends, discovering new places and hobbies, and joined 2 different bowling leagues, and also gained a year of forklift experience at my job. Everything was going pretty well until the aforementioned December 2023 nightmare. Despite everything that happened in the past month, I still made a list of goals for 2024 and I guess future years as well. I really want to get back to work and start saving money again, and go back to school at some point this decade to earn some type of degree in a field I will enjoy and want to make a career out of. Sure I was lazy and didn’t do my work in high school, but that’s years ago now. I know I truly can do anything I put my mind to. But people continue to just focus on the bad side of me and my past. I don’t understand why they can’t just see the good in me and give me chances. I am so tired of this and feel like I deserve much better. I am not a bad person. I don’t have a criminal record and have lots of potential in myself. I just had a lot of behavioral issues as a kid/teen that were mostly out of my control and didn’t get the proper help I needed. Though I’ve had suicidal thoughts many times before, I would never actually bring myself to doing such a thing. All I want is to be more appreciated and given more support, as well as having the rest of my life be worth living and filled with happiness."
1919dvu,Depression,2024-01-08,Am I depressed or this just growing up?,"I'm 17 and feel hopeless, because after trying to be healthier and mostly stopping drugs and achohol and the weird trap houses/parties (if you could call them that, just pretty much large groups of high schoolers just getting fucked up together),  I noticed that pretty much every day I feel like a failure because I'm not actually good at anything or want to do anything, it feels as if day by day, I just feel burnt out and jealous of others, and for the last couple months nearly daily,  my brain almost feels foggy and like I'm not really there, and I don't really get happy anymore, just not particularly bummed out. Like is it normal for someone my age to just accept they're never gonna get to be happy in their life. Last noticeable thing is that over time, I've pretty much lost any drive to be or do anything, like almost an absence of motivation. Is this depression or is growing up realizing that everything just kinda sucks"
1919cdl,Depression,2024-01-08,:((,"I try to live my life normally, without feeling so off. I try to live as if my life is okay. I just want to feel okay, to feel right and okay. I just want to feel right and okay. I just want to feel in line. I just want to feel right. I’m sorry if this disease I carry caused pain. I just want to be normal"
1919ccb,Depression,2024-01-08,i think i’m gonna kill myself tonight.,"i’m so tired of struggling every day. over and over and over and over i’ve gotten up, tried and all i’ve been left with is feeling worse, alone, and utterly hopeless. life isn’t worth living and nothing will ever make it worth it. i don’t matter to anyone, it feels like everyone has this secret hand shake that tells them it’s okay to be shit and uncaring towards me. everyone. i don’t think i can keep going, i have no support system, i haven’t even had a hug from someone in years. i feel guilty all the time for god knows what. my brain is just such a warzone and i can’t take it anymore. i don’t belong clearly and no one wants me here so i’m gonna do what my brain and everything else has been telling me bc that’s the only way to win this game of suffering. it’s just to not play at all and know when to quit before you waste away further. i’m sorry"
19196vo,Depression,2024-01-08,Really speed and racing thoughts and impulsive behavior at nights,"This happens to me most of the times when it comes night, when i used to take meds it was the same so I know is not a med triggering this, i feel like the necessity of break something, take a lot of pills, punch someone, do something, scream to someone, but the majority of the times they are only thoughts but I feel that if I was drunk and yea i know drunk people just feels more free I think I'm just masking and pretending that I'm CHILL but i just want to destroy something and fucking get high , idk I think it can be a lot of things, immaturity, epilepsy, BPD, boredom, just rumination, numbness, daydreaming but i really want to know what the fuck is happening with my mind because in the past it really affects me so idk i can't go to a therapist cuz i don't have money and there's no free psychologist in my country. I know you guys are not Drs but... Opinions?"

I see my therapist tomorrow and will have to tell her I'm trying to find someone here even though I hate that (I've had her for like 6 years). I also have an appointment with my psych np. I'll probably end up changing my meds some. 

I might self harm again. I've been clean 2 years 1 month. I really just... hate life. My mom is making me miserable and I can't move out yet. Id rather just be dead anyways. 

Sorry for inconviencing you if you read this..."
1918s28,Depression,2024-01-08,I want to suicide,"I just turned 25 years some days ago, but I feel like it’s enough, I’m really at my limit. I moved to another country one month ago. I have to admit that I came here with some expectations, cause I thought I will find a job in my area of work, I just wanted to be away from “home”, to have a new start, I have some friends in here, but I feel like we are friends only when it’s convenient for them to be around, when they need help or someone to complain to. This was basically all my life, trying to be there for everyone, listening and trying to be helpful, while I can’t even speak about my feelings, I just isolate and thankfully now I’m able to cry (cause for 1 year I was just numb, not able to express any emotion not even in my own room, isolated from the world as usual). 
I feel like all my childhood was just a long trauma and all the rest of my life is the response to it. I have a narcissistic mother and my father was absent all my life, he worked in another country for the last 25 years at least, they never divorced, my father came back at the end of the last year, when I’ve decided to move. 
I’ve been thru a lot of shit. I started to do drugs when I was 14y I had to mature faster than others, when I turned 15y I started to work, cause my mother was not giving me money (not even to buy food at school). When I was 19 I was arrested for international drug traffic (I was in my 2nd year of college, that ofc I managed to finish with good grades). I had multiple rape attempts in my life cause I’m a bit above average (never really felt that by myself), it’s important to mention here that I’ve got into jail because I offended a friend (even if I wanted the best for her, sometimes words come out differently from my mount), besides the cptsd I may be autistic with adhd.
4 years ago I graduated university, it was the beginning of the pandemic, my uncle died and I broke up with my ex after 3 years and we continued for another year to fool around (like he was manipulating and gaslighting me).
 I worked since I graduated trying to build my career. Things look very good from the outside, a lot of people know me and appreciate me, I have an unexplainable magnetism to people. In the last year I didn’t work at a conventional job, I had different gigs as a multidisciplinary artist, so I managed to survive from what I like to do. But I don’t enjoy anything anymore, I suffer from the imposter syndrome and no motivation, all my life I lived on the edge, in survival mode, giving all I have to the people around and not receiving anything than a superficial question or an unsolicited advice. 
In the last months I started to speak a lot with a guy, we spent some time together at his place, he is very cool and attentive, but I can’t understand if he likes me or he’s just being nice. Anyway this could turn into another problem, I’m very lonely and unmotivated and he became a source of dopamine lately, also he doesn’t deserve to deal with all this wasted potential. Also if I will be strong enough to not suicide I may move to Saudi Arabia where I got a very good job opportunity, even if this guy likes me it’s all for nothing. I was just unable to feel any kind of desire to anyone (besides the physical attraction) in the last years and speaking to him is really feeding my soul, but I can also be wrong, cause my brain is fucked. 
Before new year I blocked my mother cause she crossed all my boundaries, I unblocked her cause she wanted to send me money for my birthday (an amount of money that was just a stupid joke for me being alone in another country without a job) and then I forgot to block her again. 
Today I was going to an event to help my friends and to learn some stuff and I got lost for 40 mins trying to get there, then I had a breakdown because my parents and my aunt called me to wish me Happy name day in the worst moment possible after I asked them to give me some space. “The guy” was also at the event cause we met thru these friends. Last night I went to his place he gave me a present and today he didn’t even hug me when we met or when he left, but then replied to my stories, he’s also autistic and I have a very low vibe, somehow I understand that I’m also rejecting people in this way and I shouldn’t blame them.
  I hate myself, I hate the fact that I’m alive and everything. I just feel that’s very unfair for a traumatised people pleaser to not commit suicide because this will harm others. 
I cried for 3h until I fell asleep and then my housemates woke me up (cause I live in a shared house and they were pretty noisy), I’m crying again, my face literally hurts, I’m not even angry or impulssive, I just feel like there’s no hope and no future for me and I’m literally powerless, I won’t mention how bad my body feels cause there’s another level of fucked up. I started to write all this in my notebook, but then I remembered how my mother used to search in all my stuff, journals and messages on social media and I was ripping and burning the pages everytime after I wrote them, trying to have a tiny bit of intimacy, ofc this abuse continued later in my relationships with my exes.
Today I’ve chose to leave my story in here, I’m not afraid of being judged in general and also I’m not looking to be understood anymore, I just wanted for once in my life to be seen as a vulnerable human being, not the strong woman I was forced to be. Now I just don’t want to be anymore."
1918nss,Depression,2024-01-08,I think I’m finally okay with it,"I think at this point I’m finally okay to take the jump, I want to preface this by saying I’m definitely not okay in the head I have depression and I take medication and I have BPD but this, well this is just me being done I really don’t want to live anymore I have an amazing job, I’ve gotten everything I’ve wanted and I’m just pissed about it, it’s like you get everything you’ve ever wanted and, well it all just means nothing, my only vent is my music and I yell my heart out and everyone just sings along and smiles or dances and loves it but it’s just so so sad, every tattoo I get makes me cry when I look at myself in the shower because of the meanings they have but it’s just “nice ink” whenever I’m out, a therapist never helps they don’t understand and close friends or family just don’t feel close anymore, it’s all about the money or physical things, and finally the worst part, my girlfriend, it feels more and more every day that she just uses me and won’t do anything of even slight value, but if she wasn’t here I’d be all alone and that would mean an even quicker death maybe overdose or something else but the silence kills me, it’s haunting my head, I can’t let myself be alone in my thoughts anymore it’s driving me insane, all the terrible awful things I’ve done I’m so terrible of a person and I don’t care to apologize to anyone I hurt I need my head to stop screaming at me first but hey that’s just life isn’t it, I’m done with my feelings and emotions and just life, I’m ready to finally take the leap into oblivion or whatever is out there, I need to take another journey cause the dopamine stoped a long time ago and life just doesn’t feel like it’s worth it anymore so we’ll see how this week goes, maybe I’ll be on the news for that jump or something else we’ll see, thanks for reading  idk if I need advice or not but anything helps"

I’m just genuinely depressed by how trapped I feel in this life I just want an out because I’m in some sort of constant mental pain and I could never kill myself because I would be leaving my mum behind with literally the worst family ever (not some sort of teenage dramatic exaggeration, my mum would have no reason to be here if I wasn’t here) and also because I recognise that life has ups and downs so I would be missing out a ton if I were not to wake up tomorrow but right now I’m in the stage where I don’t know what I would be missing out on my future just seems so lonely.

And i worked for it. I did lots of things. But idk how i couldn't realize that i am dying inside. My feelings are dead. lying too much to my family, my fiancé and my friends about my life. I am not good because of the financial problems. And i am done. I don't think that i will find a way out. I've lost my control. I cannot sleep, cannot eat.. Tomorrow I've to make payment for my business. But i don't have this money. I've already sold my car, my american strat...
I'm trying to sell my house but it's not easy. Because I'm living in a fckng country that its economy dies. I don't have time to wait for that sale. So I'm planning to left a letter for my family and friends. It's s gonna be my last words.

So guys please whatever you do don't gamble your life. My life was so important for me but rn kinda worthless.

I have depression, generalised anxiety disorder and ADHD, all of which i need to be medicated for because of how much they affect my daily life, and even WITH the medication, I am still affected by them every day regardless because medication isn't magic, as we know. I don't understand how with 31 pages of evidence that i sent them of diagnoses, prescriptions, proof that i've been on sleeping pills on and off for years because the anxiety and adhd cause me awful insomnia, and a list of mental health professionals that i'd need more than my own fingers and toes to count on, they've STILL awarded me nothing. This doesn't give me great hope for the appeal/tribunal process, and i honestly have no idea where to start with regards filling in the appeal form. This is especially hard right now whilst having ADHD that's currently unmedicated because of the national medication shortage.  
If any fellow ADHDers, or people with these mental health conditions who've won their appeals could offer any advice, support, zoom call to help me or literally anything, i'd be very appreciative because i'm really stressed about it now, especially as i only have 2 weeks left to appeal because their letter (dated 21st december) only arrived yesterday, so that's already cost me a couple of weeks of my 1 month time limit, which i hardly think is fair.

I don't even know what to do anymore. I feel like I'm on repeat every day. Wake up, work, dreaded and depressed, come home and stress out until I fall asleep and do it all again. Even on my days off, I don't do anything except feel dread. I don't go anywhere and rarely get to hang with my friends anymore. I hate working, but everyone needs money. But I feel like money is near pointless anymore, shit is just so expensive, even if I save money, what's it for? I'm just trapped in my day, not like I can go and do anything with it, and I can't do anything major with it like buy a house or anything because it's just too fucking expensive. My hobbies don't interest me anymore and I find I just do nothing.

A lot has changed since then I have a gf who I talk to about this but I never tell her the full truth because she’s struggling with her own issues and I don’t want her to panic about anything that’s happening to me. Furthermore I tried taking my parents advice and got a job to make money and do something but these feelings I have never changed yet I don’t tell anyone that. However, I don’t know how much longer I can keep quiet about it much longer as everyone i know noticed I’m eating significantly less. I already was an extremely light person but I’ve probably hit the lowest weight I’ve been at in 5 years. 

And I think the reason why this is happening is because my brain just can’t really trick my body into wanting to take care of myself anymore so it does the bare minimum needed to survive as I’m just very tired of everything and always feel exhausted and like everything is a challenge. But like I said I don’t talk to anyone about it because I already know what the response will be. I sorta just wish I had someone that would listen ig. 

I’m sorry if I sound very selfish and entitled as many people have no one talk to but I just felt like maybe expressing my feelings somewhere else could help how I’m feeling."
1918216,Depression,2024-01-08,I just need to vent a lot,"I want to scream because of how angry I am with everything, specially myself. I know I'm pushing myself too much and putting too much pressure to start feeling better but MY FUCKING GOD I've been on therapy and antidepressants for 5 fucking years now and depressed for 14. Why can't I just function like a normal, healthy person?? I obsess over people and make them my whole world even when I know it's not healthy, I just do it and forget about my own needs. I let people step on me because I want to feel loved so badly it's pathetic. I hate myself and I'll never be better. I've been sleeping for 14-18 hours A DAY because everytime I reconnect with reality I want to cry and nothing fucking helps. I'm unproductive and obese I fucking hate myself for wanting to feel better and ruining my life on my own. I would love to ask for help but I don't even know what I need right now. I just wish I was never born."

1917ps7,Depression,2024-01-08,Moments of Happiness,"28M. This is my first post on here and I’m hoping to see if anyone can relate to something I experience. Since around 16 years old I’ve been in and out of being depressed. Here lately I’m depressed almost all the time. But every so often I get these little moments of happiness. The moments are completely random and don’t occur during certain events or situations. Unfortunately it’s during the time of being happy that I also realize how depressed I’ve been &amp; wishing I could feel like this all the time. Then as soon as the moment came, it’s over, back to grey skies and not giving a shit about anything. 
I wonder if during those periods I’m happy if that’s how most people feel all the time? 

I’m curious if there’s anyone else that experiences these mini-moments of happiness? It’s almost like that feeling of being a kid again and having excitement for something. As much as I hate to admit it, nothing usually excites me. I wish I could figure out a way to prolong these moments. What types of things do you all do to get yourself out of a rut?"
1917p6u,Depression,2024-01-08,Completely numb and lost.,"I feel like I'm being punished. Life's never been easy for me, I stutter, I struggled in school, lost a brother when I was 18, bipolar and a recovering alcoholic.

My current situation feels like a complete joke. I lost me job just before COVID started, it took me over 2 years to find a new job. The hours weren't great but the pay was amazing. Then 1 year later I got made redundant and have to start all over again. It's been 5 months of being unemployed again, I'm married with a 8y/o girl and I'm not providing. I feel useless and like there's no way out. 

In life you're meant to grow as a person, move up in life. But because of my unemployment, we're struck in a 1 bedroom apartment and strugglinv to pay the bills. Again. 

I'm being punished for something. My life's just one big joke."

1917dli,Depression,2024-01-08,Should I tell my boyfriend I’m admitting myself to a psychiatric ward?,I have been struggling with my mental health since November when I was fired from my job after being set up by coworkers. I have been unable to find work and unemployment pays me about a 1/3 of what I was making which leaves me with very little money of my own to spend. It has had a detrimental affect on my mental health. I am so depressed and I just had a fight with my boyfriend who has asked for time away from me. I don’t want him to think I’m going to make him feel bad. Should I tell him that I am admitting myself or have him find out on his own?

I don't know what direction I'm heading. Who I am becoming or where I would be if I did things differently. I feel like My thoughts are meaningless and I don't know where to start. I'm a crippled mess. I'm not one to call it quits but I feel defeated. I wish it were different. I'm learning to accept things I cannot change and Change what I can, but I somehow feel like I'm being dragged back to square one every time I try. My motivation isn't really there and my self interest is dying. I'm giving it my best ever day because I care enough to keep going despite how lost It all may feel. I support myself as much as I can and truly believe I'll see happier days but I can't help to feel completely worthless no matter how much potential I may have. I feel like I've wasted so much and don't know how to make up for it. My dreams feel closer to the edge and I feel like I'm drowning. I sincerely pray for the best. I can only handle so much and I'm really trying not to be so hard on myself. Any uplifting advice can surely help."

I made it to medical school right now and it makes the whole thing even worse, considering how smart my peers and friends are and how stupid I feel struggling with everything.

1916gip,Depression,2024-01-07,No change at all,"Today i was looking at a snowy landscape in the mountains via webcam because i love it and i want to live there. Suddenly i remembered that about 15-18 years ago i laid down in the snow in my hometown because i wanted to freeze to death. It didn‘t work, my intention wasn‘t strong enough. Or better to say i was and am a coward. But i wonder if the mountain side with it’s snow has this great affection to me because i want to lay down again. Maybe just to do nothing and stay in my comfort zone. I realised although my life changed a lot since then, my feelings didn‘t. I am lacking of good friends, i am not good in making any and i am not sure if i like the town i am living in and i don‘t know if i should leave my boyfriend because he don‘t want to move to another place with me. The only thing i knew is that i feel bad and really lonely very often… like when i was in my teens. I’‘ aware that i suffer from depression since i am 13  At least at this time i had the hope that it‘ll get better. But it didn‘t and i still feel the same way.  Because of that i would like to give it a try to start at a new place. Even if it won‘t work out there would be nice nature and it would be easier to have a or some pet/s. But it‘s really hard to decide to give up my boyfriend and the few acquaintances i have here. But  i know that my acquaintances aren‘t dependable. And it destroys me to know that i have no reliable friends except of my boyfriend. That makes me feel so lonely.  I am really afraid to have no one who would help me if i decide to move away. Most of the meetings with the acquaintances make me unhappy, because it always remind that i have no real good friends. But that‘s the wrong way to think about it. I hope i can change my thinking about all that things. I only want to be satisfied with my life like it is. Because it‘s ok in the most parts. And quiet a lot of people have no good friends. Maybe i‘ll have to live with the bad feelings and the loneliness. It is possible to accept it for good? Any tips?"
1916ekc,Depression,2024-01-07,I’m 21(F) and I have no life,"I missed out on the college experience by staying home to take care of my ill mother. I’m about to be 22 and I haven’t made new friends since graduating high school, never went to a party, and never had a boyfriend. I had my first kiss at 20 with a guy I didn’t even like.

I have always struggled with a lack of confidence and social anxiety, and these days I feel very suicidal because I have so much shame. Shame about not being “normal” like everyone else, shame about being a late bloomer.

I cannot hold down a job to save my life. I’ve had like 20 of them in the past two years (might have adhd). I want to go back to school but that means I’ll be graduating by 25 or 26.

I feel so incredibly behind, especially looking and social media and seeing how much everyone has matured and moved on. I’ve missed out on so much and it feels like it’s over. Please help. I’m on the brink of suicide and I don’t know how much more of this I can take."
1916e35,Depression,2024-01-07,THE REASON WHY I FEEL LIKE SHIT,"Well, Here goes nothing...  
Me (16 M) had a pretty good relationship with a girl (16 F) but she was older than me by 3 months,  just like every other relationships ours had upside downs and things got worse by me trying too much because I was afraid of breaking-up. She said she had exams and she didn't wanted me to annoy her and distract her from her studies. Well me (being an Idiot) I didn't texted her at all for some days but she was lying cause 2 days of me not texting or visiting she posted a NGL story. which somebody asked ""Are you in a Relationship?"" and she Responded with ""Idk lol"". So I got confused and texted her ""What's up"" and which she ghosted me for hours and She posted a story of her favourite song which is ""Perfect by Ed Sheeran"". I replied to her story and asked ""What's the matter?"" and which she didn't respond to it either. and well the day she responded said ""I've Math Exam tomorrow"" and I said ""I know you'll A+ it Babe"" and which she said ""We got to discuss about something."" and I said ""Okay?"" and which she stared talking about that she needs time to think that if she can continue in this relationship and I said ""No. You already ghosted me for days and I hate it and I love you sm"" which she responded ""I don't love you"" which I said ""Okay"" and she said ""Get out of my life"" and I said ""I will, I will one day, this pain would be gone for good"" and I said ""Block me on everywhere"" She did blocked me indeed... and Since Nov 9, I don't know if she's okay or dead, And I don't know what am I gonna do. Why should I suffer for this. Having sex with her was probably the best thing that has ever happened to me, I felt like I've never experienced something like that in my life. last week I had my wallet, iPhone and my Air Pods Stolen. and I have to wait till summer to get a new phone when I do summer Job. and Fuck you god. Why are you doing this to me. Honestly Fuck Everything.

1916deu,Depression,2024-01-07,I've been clinically depressed for 10 years.,"I've been depressed since I was 16 and I'm almost 26. The last 10 years just came by really fast. Everything changed my 2 grandma's died my dad has stage 4 cancer for 2 years. I've been unemployed for a year and broke. Entire family is having a financial crisis. I dunno what to do I'm clueless on being an adult despite being an adult for almost 8 years already. My anxiety attack renders me useless for days. Everything I do I doubt myself before I didn't even know what's an ""Anxiety attack"" when I'm afraid of everything just talking I always assume the worse scenario. I don't feel alive I just feel like cruising through days and waiting for something to happen. I almost jumped off a bridge many many times. The things that I do before isn't fun anymore and my anxiety is stopping me from discovering new things. I don't wanna live like this anymore nor I don't want to live at all. People always say your ""anxiety attack"" is just an excuse to escape responsibilities. Every time I get reminded of that I just wanna jump off again."
1916ang,Depression,2024-01-07,I'm worthless,"I've been working my ass off for the last 6 months for this really important life changing exam and it's next month.

We had mock tests and stuff in our tutoring classes and  I didn't rank in the Top 3. Moreover, I'm not even doing well in any mock test for that matter. 

To add more salt to the burn, people I know who definitely know less than I do are doing better than I am.

I don't know what I'm doing wrong. I sacrificed friendships, outings, my entire social life, have woken up at 4am everyday irrespective of when I went to bed the previous night, studied 12-14 hours everyday. And for what? To realise, a month before my exam, that it's not worth it? I am not good enough?

To anyone wondering why an exam is so important to me...well when you're a single child in an Asian family who grew up as an overachiever the stakes are pretty fucking high. I've been depressed and anxious my entire life trying to please my parents and everytime, no matter how hard I work, it's never enough."
1915mtx,Depression,2024-01-07,28 years old and feel that I've ruined my life.,"I am a 28 yo (F) on anti-depressants, but starting to fall back into my habits of ruminating and feeling suicidal. 

A little about me - I live in Los Angeles. I love this city. I graduated from a prestigious acting school in 2020 with my Master's degree at 24 years old. I signed with an agent out of New York City from my program's ""showcase"". When Covid started lifting in 2021, I had a complete mental breakdown. I was so young and trying to build a life in LA, in a city I love, and felt that I would have to leave it behind at any second to move to New York. I know this sounds dumb, but I think I was just so overwhelmed by the real world and not being a student for the first time and felt that I was suddenly living outside of my own life and had to be available to everyone at all times. 

Long story short, I sort of fell out of love with acting and do it as a hobby. My mom is a little narcissistic, and it was the only way I got acceptance from her, growing up. I definitely thought it was going to save me from an abusive childhood. 

Over the past 3 ish years - I have worked as a nanny, I've worked in an awesome internship for a feminist filmmaker, I've worked on set's as a commercial PA and on a feature film as a PA, I've done some costume design, and I've worked as a restaurant host. I've been exploring some hobbies like film photography (which I LOVE) and have started writing my second short film. The problem is, it never feels like enough. I feel that I'm living on the outskirts of my own life. I'm so ashamed of my job history, it doesn't feel that I've done anything worthwhile, but have just been in dumb part-time survival jobs. 

Maybe I am feeling this way, after spending the holidays with my mom, but the comments from my family about my life are CONSTANT. They act as if I have completely ruined my life by stepping away from acting, and that I'll be stuck being a server for the rest of my life. My mom constantly comments about how ""hard"" LA is and that she just doesn't want to see me struggle. Ironically, yeah I think LA is an intense city sure, but I've never been in a place with more passionate people in my life, who want to get shit done. All of the opportunities I've had on set have been from my networking and people skills. 

I guess I just feel that my family acts as if I am a depressed pariah. They continuously make comments that I need a life coach, and these comments are what overwhelm me so much that I start to become su\*cidal. The pressure I put on myself is so immense that rather than taking action, I often just think and ruminate about how I've ruined my life. 

I'm in therapy but am so stumped, I don't know what to do anymore. "
1915m1f,Depression,2024-01-07,Tired of life,"Been struggling with depression for a long time now.
My mom and aunt are dying, my relationship is going downhill, I have made some friends in the new city that I live in but depression and health issues are taking a toll on me so I let that kinda go. I just got a new job but It's already going shit, this is my second week of calling in sick because of my health issues. I fell out with my parents in law and all I do now is sit inside and think how to do this, how to live. 
 I'm exhausted of trying. I tried therapy, I read books, I tried fitness, making new friends, trying out new things, trying to eat better and all that but nothing seems to help. When I'm with people I feel more lonely then ever, my mom lives far away so I try to see her as much as I can but I'm just so tired of trying.

1915hgw,Depression,2024-01-07,What Should I Do?,"About two months I went for a physical and the doctor found a rash on my back. They took a photograph of it. In the photo my underwear and potentially more are visible. I wasn't really thinking and it didn't really occur to me until after that I am self conscious of that photo and do not want them keeping it in their records. Every medical professional friend I have talked to since then has told me that they will not delete the picture as nothing can be deleted from your medical record. I am seriously depressed about it because I do not want it sitting in a database somewhere forever. Everybody I ask just brushes it aside and says ""they're medical professionals, they don't care, don't worry"" but I know medical professionals in the past who have been unprofessional and made fun of patients (I know a nurse that would post photos of her patients on snapchat). I honestly don't know what to do but it is just eating me away knowing that the picture will always be there and it's making me even more depressed thinking about it. I want to ask my doctor to delete it but I don't think they will. Plus the rash went away anyway after I put an over the counter on it, it was nothing serious."

My thought was what if I hit the point where I cross that line who is there to pull me back , to my knowledge nobody as I never open up or say what I really think about myself , Im scared that me being dependable , has made others snow blind to what's really going on .

I’ve always drank occasionally but since I got let go from my job last month I’ve been drinking every night without fail. I’ve fully discovered that alcohol is the one thing that makes everything feel as close to normal as I’ve ever felt. I’m scared and sad though… i want to be able to raw dog through every day like other people can, for my health. Reality is just so HARSH. I’m in therapy but the progress is so little and so slow.

1914o7g,Depression,2024-01-07,I went behind my psychiatric mental health nurse practitioner’s back and never told her,"Earlier this year I was very frustrated with my
psychiatric mental health nurse practitioner. 

The medications I tried weren’t working, and it seemed like she didn’t really understand me.

There was this one appointment I had with her that really ticked me off. I had asked her to try a new anti depressant along with my current mood stabilizer, and maybe next time we could discuss trying a new ADHD med.

She said sure. She told me should would start me on a new anti depressant. She told me it would be ready for pickup tomorrow morning. 

I go to the pharmacy the next day and she didn’t send it in. She forgot or something. So I have my mom call and ask them about it. They said it should be ready the next day.

I go to my pharmacy and there is an ADHD med ready for pick up for me. 

She ended up not prescribing what we discussed and put me on a new ADHD med. Sure I was talking about it at my appointment but I told her we could discuss it next time because I was much more worried about my depression than my ADHD. She was fine with putting me on a new anti depressant.

I received no call, text, or anything whatsoever that she changed her mind about prescribing me my new anti depressant.

I am much worried about my depression more than my ADHD. I told her I was not having the best time just on my mood stabilizer and I was having depression symptoms.

I was pissed. So I decided to use Nurx behind her back to have a provider on their prescribe me a new anti depressant. Nurx is like a tele-health app that treats certain conditions, and in my case it was depression. 

To this day I still have the same psychiatric mental health nurse practitioner and I never told her.

I’m not sure what she is trying to do for me. She isn’t helping me. I have been on 13 different psychiatric meds within 2 years. 

Tomorrow I have an appointment with my PCP and hopefully she can refer me to an actual psychiatrist."

I want to leave my church and never look back. I want to burn everything to the ground and start again. I want to start fresh in a place where I won’t make attachments to anyone or anything.

Even better, I want to die. If I could die in a car crash 🤌 that would be amazing. Or even shot and killed. I daydream about someone just walking up to me and killing me.

1914cas,Depression,2024-01-07,My (31M) wife’s (31F) anxiety and depression is destroying our marriage,"Sorry if this is long, but I just need to vent.

My wife has been through some very traumatic events in her life. She has extremely toxic/narcissistic parents, has had issues with drugs and alcohol, and her sibling suffered from a very horrible disease and unfortunately passed away 6 years ago, about a year before we met.

My wife, in general, is extremely sweet and thoughtful and intelligent. My was was understandably going through a very difficult time when we first started dating and had issues with drugs and alcohol to cope with the death of her sibling. She worked very hard to cut drugs out of her life entirely and cut down on her drinking, and I’m very proud of her for that. 

Things were going quite well for a while, basically until our wedding about 1.5 years ago. She was happy most of the time but dealt with anxiety and grieving her sibling, but it was manageable. We got married, bought a nice house, and we both work remote jobs that pay very well. Our jobs can be stressful at times, but for the most part are very flexible and secure.

My wife is at a point now where she is NEVER happy. There is always something for her to be upset at. She has what I would consider to be severe emotional breakdowns on a regular basis - to the point of screaming, crying, and even hitting herself. These breakdowns can be triggered by anything ranging from work, body dysmorphia, reading something horrible about politics on Twitter, or her displeasure with herself being so emotional and angry all the time.

I have effectively assumed the role as her caretaker. I do all of the cleaning, laundry, bills, home maintenance, etc. Everything I do in my day to day I do to try and make sure she does not get upset and have a breakdown. I try to be extremely sweet to her with constant words of affirmation, yet she complains and breaks down over the fact that I do not ever give her words of affirmation and tells me to stop gaslighting her when I push back a little.

She is on a lot of medicine for depression and has meds for panic attacks. These medicine have caused her libido to drop to essentially nothing. Not only that, but I feel like there is no appropriate time for me to initiate because she is always depressed or anxious about something. She gets upset I don’t initiate. When we do rarely have sex, she just lies there and looks miserable. We used to have a vibrant and active sex life.

Nights are never good. She doesn’t sleep well, and she is in an endless cycle about being anxious about not sleeping or work the next day. On good days, they end poorly because she is scared of what tomorrow will bring. She can have a good day, and she will get in bed and immediate scroll Twitter only to get upset at whatever atrocity happened that day. 

When I try to talk to her about issues she breaks down. I’ve tried recommending therapy several times but every time she says she’s already been and what would I know because I’m healthy. She does see a psychiatrist every few months.

I’m at a point where I just don’t know what to do. If I were to divorce her I’d be seriously worried she would injure herself, or worse. She doesn’t have very supportive family she can fall back on. 

We both always wanted kids, and for a long time I thought she’d be a great mother/partner. Now I feel that she is far too unstable to have kids with. Even a moderately stressful situation can send her spiraling, I can’t imagine the level of postpartum depression she would face.

I’m not even sure if I’m looking for advice here, but I just had to write this out."

191467v,Depression,2024-01-07,Having to end a relationship because of my depression,"I've been in a relationship for about 7.5 years now. I've always had depression, very few upward spirals. But since my grandma who raised me when my mom couldn't died almost 3 months ago, I haven't been able to spiral back up yet. 

It makes sense. He told me that if I can't take care of myself then I can't be in a relationship. And I understand that to be true, I've agreed with that as an understanding for years, but I guess I just never wanted to apply it to myself, it gets too real. I've been depressed with him for 8 years because I don't want to end our relationship, but I also don't want to hurt him. 

He's been depressed for a long time as well, and he's started to get better. I was too before she died, and I've been unable to stop the spiral. Thoughts of dying came back after not having them for about 3 years. 

I'm just struggling with this now. If I really can't take care of myself anymore, I need to leave. But the situation I'm in is hard. I've lived with him and his family for about 5 years now. Emotionally, his family has been there for me than my own ever has. And leaving him means leaving all of them, and having to go back to living with my mom, where I was the most depressed I've been in my life. After leaving her home I was able to start healing, and I'm so scared of going back there. I'm unemployed and have no savings, I have no option but to live with her, and I know I'm going to get worse there. But he's right, we can't be in a relationship if I can't function anymore. I just don't know where to go from here, and having this in my mind feels even harder to keep moving forward than it did before when I hadn't thought of this at all.

Any advice from people who have had similar situations would be amazing. I want to spend my life with him, I want to be happy and I can't figure it out right now, and this feels debilitating. Ending the relationship because I can't be a partner right now is the most logical answer, but emotionally I'm struggling with this."
19142xb,Depression,2024-01-07,The curse of being alive.,"The curse of living is knowing that you'll be working in a job that you don't like for the rest of your life. 
It's the sadness of thinking that the carefree days of your childhood won't come back ever again. It's to deal will all the responsabilities of adult life that you can't escape from. 
It's feeling like life ended at 25, the rest is just existing.
It's being aware that you eventually going to die and be forgotten and for that reason, nothing you do really matters. Everything is just unimportant.
It's living in a divided society that will never be as one.
It's watching yourself in the mirror getting older. Dusting up old photos from your past and realizing those golden times just don't exist anymore.
It's being faced with the inminent enpty void of the universe. 
Life is just a curse. 
We are waiting to die, trying to do something that's not that boring in the meantime."
19141ro,Depression,2024-01-07,Is my family abusive or am I dramatic?,"(This is a bit of a long vent, so please stick with me. and btw it's only the surface level about my life, most is very simplified too.)

I (16m) think my family (two parents and five siblings) is abusive because they don't give me any love or emotional care, and they're the reason I have trauma and depression.

(Just for context, we are an immigrant family; my family doesn't believe in mental illnesses; they think it's a curable thing and something you can control.)

They believe that giving me gifts and material possessions like food, clothing, and phones is all they need to do, when this is literally the bare minimum, and I don't even care about getting stuff. All I really need is for someone to care about me and how I feel.

Me and my mom had a fight today about school, and she said something along the lines of, ""You're not normal! You see everything negatively; we need to get you checked for any mental illnesses."" I won't lie; even I think I might have some problems, like autism, for example.

So I wonder, am I the really the problem, am I wrong, am I being dramatic.

My dad is an abusive, narcissistic person who's present but not really; he's hurt all of us at some point.

My mom is manipulative, I think. Just from her behavior, and maybe a narcissist as well, just from the fact she always makes things about herself.

My siblings don't care about me (for the most part) based on what they've said in the past and how they view and compare me to other people. They see me as incompetent, autistic, spoiled, dumb, childish, lazy, et cetera.

My family is not emotionally intelligent; I can say that for a fact. They don't understand me at all; my mom constantly says I'm the problem and that I need to care about how she feels and what everyone else feels. Either they suck at showing they care about me or they really don't, and all of this is just formality because I'm part of the ""family.""

They've never once asked how I was or how I felt. I could be doing something like su/cide, and they would still not see that I'm depressed. It's so obvious, but I guess my family isn't the brightest tool in the shed...

I'm 16; why is the only child in this family the one who has to adjust for everyone else's happiness? All of my siblings are adults; why does the child need to change?

I have trauma from when I was young that's carried over, like being self-conscious from constantly being told I'm doing things wrong and yelled at for making mistakes.

For example, when I was young:

They tell me to wake them up in the morning, and when I listen and do what they say I get yelled at. So as a child I thought ""Oh I did something wrong, I'm not gonna do this again.""

So I didn't wake them up in the morning, and I was still yelled at. I'm still in the wrong.

Stuff like this has messed up as kid, because now I feel like I never do anything right.

Whatever I do, I get yelled at, which has led me to not be able to do anything without feeling anxious and feeling like I'm doing something wrong, especially when someone is watching.

And when they do see me doing something, they come over and say, ""Let me do it instead."" As if I don't know what I'm doing...

I'm constantly told I'm the problem and that I need to be more understanding of the sacrifices and love they show me. The biggest thing my mom loves to say is, ""If I didn't love you, I wouldn't be doing this."" Yeah, mom, thanks a lot for making me cry, giving me trauma as a kid, and still giving me more—the best gift ever.

Oh and her second favorite, ""You're making my life harder!"" By... being depressed? And who's fault is that.


(I would like to add more, but I don't want to make this too long; this is just the surface level too, by the way.)"

1913m0p,Depression,2024-01-07,there is something deeply wrong with me,"(15F) for about 6 months my sister has been telling me that i “have a horrible attitude problem”, which usually i wouldn’t be disagreeing with someone over. but about a year ago all 4 of my closest friends since kindergarten dropped me due to a few factors but one being my attitude and the way i treat people. after this happened it was like a flip switched and i just changed, i don’t really know what i did to change, or what changed, but i just started being nicer in little ways. or started not carrying on conversations that have no good use for me. or if someone started being rude to me or having an attitude with me, i wouldn’t snap back. i would simply just walk away. which for me, it feels like it’s physically impossible to do sometimes. 

my mother is bipolar, and just a horrible person in general. growing up she projected every horrible thought she had onto me. she got the idea that since my dad liked me, and she despised my dad, that i just magically deserved everything horrible. so i was and still am emotionally abused by my mother. i’ve learned that whenever im in a fight with my mother, that i have to have a specific kind of reaction with a snappy attitude and try to be more right to win. my moms mother also had the same problem, but only specifically targeting me. she would specifically neglect me from the things that she was abundantly giving to my siblings and cousins. this made 5-12 year old me very hurt and mad and sad.

i am a waitress and yesterday at work my manager and floor leader were being rude to me and just being weird in general (for context my sister also works at the same place i work) i have a fight or flight reaction to things like these, as previously said. but me having the change in attitude and behavior since my friends leaving, i tried to react as nicely as possible. whenever they said snapping or rude things to me i tried to just brush it off and go along with my work. at one point my floor leader said something so rude that i started to say something snappy back, but then i stopped myself and just walked away. this was attitude. in my mind that was not attitude and it is just what i have taught myself to do in these situations. today, i caught my sister texting my mom about how horrible i am being to my manager and even customers at work. this blew a fuse. i don’t know how to feel or what to do. my mom told my sister that she needs to “tell my dad” about these things. these UNTRUE things."

About a year ago, I was already struggling with an alcohol addiction (people here don't really care about underage drinking), and even though now I've been sober for about 3-4ish months, lately I've started picking up smoking. I've been barely passing my classes for the past few years, and I honestly don't even know how I haven't been held back yet.

I don't want this, I really don't. I've seen my other classmates pass with high grades, while I'm over here barely managing to get a 50/100. Everyone around me just says ""if you sat down and studied, maybe you'd get better"". But that's the thing, even if I did, I wouldn't. I've tried, but the end result was always the same. At this point, is it even worth the effort if the end result will still be the same?

If this is me now, in HS, I have no idea how I'll survive in the real world. I want to turn my life around, I really do. I want to get good grades, I don't want to be addicted to anything, I just want to be like the others. I just don't know how, and if, I can do that.

1912thj,Depression,2024-01-07,I think I’m ready to take my own life.,"
Throwaway account because I have family/friends on my main. I have struggled with my mental health a lot since I was about 6/7. 

I have an amazing family (who yes at times could have done better, but they are always learning and educating themselves) But have done an amazing job and have dedicated their lives to me. 

On the surface I have lived a really normal and good life. However, its been plagued by grooming and paedophilia, abused for 8 years by 3 different men, attempted murder, suicide attempts, witnessing vivid murder and death, snaked by a lot of my ‘friends’, super ill Dad and then lost my Dad, problems with drink and drugs. I could go on forever. 

I am also diagnosed with an eating disorder, PTSD, anxiety, depression and borderline personality disorder. 

With all this in mind, I am so proud of myself for actually lasting this long. Yes, I have tried taking my life in the past but I’ve either had something happen and called help myself or someone has found me and called for help without my consent. 

However, I just don’t actually think I can do it anymore. This is so much weight to carry around, I’ve tried therapy but they just always add me on a waiting list or when I do speak to somebody, I disagree with what they say so cannot continue to see them. They try stick me on medication despite my refusal as every pill I’ve tried now has made me worse. 

I’ve tried exercise, eating better, changing routines, speaking to loved ones as much as I can. Yet, I’m still lying in bed crying my eyes out because it just feels like the right time. 

I usually use my family to talk myself out of these dark thoughts but this time round I can’t help but think how much better they will be without me. 

I’m unsure what I want from this post, I guess its kinda one last attempt at a cry for help - maybe people who are older than me and experienced the same can tell me life will be okay. 

Or just some supporting words if I do decide that this is my last night. 

Thank you for reading, it means a lot to be heard.

This is provided some good opportunity to reflect on the problem, have strong work ethics never always being on time for work always tried doing quality work and such but employers don't provide feedback your only called into the office without some valid reason and terminated.

Looking back over the last twenty years of employers which are technically still around today if lucky these employers have same posting for the same positions I was orginally hired they remained vacant taken down then reposted.

It appears I've been applying for positions which they say are full-time then fire person after hired down the road for unknown reasons. I personally want to avoid these companies because let me tell this takes mental toll on someone today.

When the attack happened my mom was at the gym, and i was alone. Played some games, ate sweets, healed sh and everything was ok until i suddenly laid down on the floor and started crying and rolling around against my will. It's like i had separated into 2 parts internally, one part was rolling my body around and was driving me into suicidal thoughts, the second part was trying to stop this shit and continue playing geometry dash. So I tried to get up and relax, but no. I went on rolling to find a sharp knife, fell down the stairs and hurt my ankle. Still got up and tried to stab myself repeatedly with a ruler, then a spoon, then i found blades and sliced my hands and i finally stopped the panicking and just laid down on my back. Blood streamed out of my hand, i didn't care though, because I didn't commit suicide and that was enough. Applied a bandage to my hand and went to my pc, finished playing dry out with my foot (still doing the challenge, 369 attempts and a panic attack helped me finish the level). Mom got home, we spoke and i went to sleep.

My mental health has taken a dive and I’ve been struggling to even get out of bed in the morning. Friday of last week, on my drive to work I broke down, turned back, and went home when I was two minutes away from my place of work. 

I assumed most people hate their jobs and feel this way, but my therapist told me it is not normal to wish for death as a result of your job. I cannot quit my current job because I have bills to pay and it is one of the higher paying positions in my area with no experience or education required. Also I am in technical school, but will have to take this semester off due to financial issues.

I told my therapist I would reach out to a psychiatrist, but I’m honestly sick of taking different meds and have been off of them for about a year now.

I'm always looking at the clock, I'm counting everything, for example how much of sleep I will get If I fall asleep at this our or another, when I wake up I count how much minuts I will drive to work, in work I'm counting when I will be going to home, In home I'm counting hours to sleep time, and it's like that everyday. 
With those comes sleeping problems, overthinking, being overwhelmed and such.

And then when it does happen, and when the happy feelings wear off, I always find myself disappointed. I have a good life. I have a supportive family, I have friends, I'm in college and I'm not at risk of ever going hungry or losing shelter. So why am I so miserable? Why can't I feel happy with what I have? Why must I want more? Why do I have to be so selfish? Why do I cycle through the same traps, the same mistakes over and over, just for the hope of finding a reason not to waste away? Why, after all of this, am I still so fucking empty?"
1911i86,Depression,2024-01-07,My brother had a knife and wanted to kill himself today.,"My little brother, who is 12 years old, was feeling so overwhelmed that he wanted to harm himself. It all started when our mom removed the lock from his door because he had scratched up her stools with a knife. She had taken away his game the previous night because he was being too noisy. In his frustration, he grabbed a big knife from the drawer and threatened to end his life. My mom kept pleading with him to give her the knife, but he accused her of never caring about anyone but herself and not loving him. I decided to enter his room and take the knife away from him, even though I wasn't afraid of getting hurt. I understand exactly how he feels because I feel the same way.  
  
Eventually, he handed me the knife and we hugged each other. My mom called his father and went back into the room to discuss his behavior and other issues. To be honest, I've stopped talking to my mom and try to avoid her because she is toxic. Both my brother and I desperately want to escape this situation, and we have even thought about ending our lives. It saddens me that I never really bonded with my brother because my mom had him with a second-degree sex offender.  
  
He recently confided in me that his father used to watch him shower and take inappropriate pictures of him when he was just 8 years old. His father would also touch him inappropriately and constantly stare at me. I warned him about his father's behavior, and he felt devastated when he discovered that his father had a presence on the internet as a pedophile. He vowed to never speak to him again.  
  
Now, my mom is trying to reconcile with her ex, who is my brother's father, after kicking out her husband not too long ago. If that happens, I won't stick around anymore. I've had enough. I would rather be homeless with a nerve disease. My brother has also expressed that he doesn't want to come back home and is currently in the hospital."

1910ymc,Depression,2024-01-07,"Therapy, coach or some other form of ass-kicker?","I am shopping around for therapists. 

I had major breakthroughs last year where I finally saw my way out of this negative mindset. This was like stepping into a new dimension. Not merely a bubble of false hope. It was real. However here I am again...

I am looking for some kind of coach or therapist.

What really helped me before was having people around me that were going after their goals and had positive mindsets. I pushed myself to match them the best I could but I lost focus of it once I returned home. However it did feel real and I can feel it from time to time when I really try to connect to it.

This being said I would like to have someone to help formulate and structure this path with me. Essentially hold my hand and kick me up the ass. There are still negative psycho-emotional patterns which I identify with and then these totally obstruct me from any kind of decent life. I am still a slave to them...

I think having regular reflections and support would really help.

Can anyone recommend what has worked for them or just say something based on the above? Has anyone used a coach/life coach instead of a therapist?"

I got a job and I honestly think I’ll save, move out, buy a gun and shoot myself. I don’t want to disappoint anyone but then again that doesn’t matter.

1910pbe,Depression,2024-01-07,Advice needed about medication,"Hey everyone. My therapist diagnosed me with anxiety, and lately, I’ve been dealing with some depression. I get those are two sides of the same coin, but I’ve been more depressed than usual. My therapist recommended I see a physician and maybe start an antidepressant. My partner who is also a counselor thinks that’s a good idea too. I know it probably is, but I’m scared that I will have negative (mental) side effects. Often on commercials for antidepressants, they narrator says “talk to your doctor is your symptoms worsen or you have suicidal thoughts,” and I realllllllyyyy don’t want my symptoms to get worse. So, have yall had any experiences like that while on antidepressants? Or am I totally off base here? If yes, what were you taking and (if you know) is that fairly common? Any general thoughts, advice, things to alleviate my concerns, etc  would be appreciated."

19103b3,Depression,2024-01-07,I don’t want to get better,"This is going to sound ridiculous, and I feel bad for even saying anything after seeing some of the comments on here. Some people seem to have it so so much worse so I’m sorry if it’s wasting people’s time, but I digress. 

As the title says, I don’t feel like I want to get better. I’ve recently moved into a house with my beautiful partner, she’s far more than I deserve and I should be delighted, but there’s always a cloud over me. I’ve felt depressed, not suicidal, for about 8 months but I just do not want to get better. 

I know what I should do, I’m slightly overweight and could use to exercise, which would improve my mood, but I don’t want too. Any slight arguments or things I disagree with j should pull up and stand up for myself, because then they wouldn’t happen, but I feel like I deserve to be plagued by these things so I don’t pull them up. I don’t want to get better. I don’t feel like I deserve to get better. This is how I feel I should be, always one small thing away from a meltdown, always on the edge of a precipice ready to crumble at a moments notice. 

I shouldn’t feel like this, I have no reason to, but I just feel like I needed to say it and to wonder if anyone else feels like this is all they deserve?"
190zwvr,Depression,2024-01-07,Acne is making me want to kill myself,"Not sure if it’s a common topic around here and it may sound shallow but i swear my acne makes me wanna kms. 

I’m a 24 yrs old female and I’ve never really had acne until this year . It’s been 7 months since i tried different treatments and went to lots of doctors . I’m completely lost . I hate myself more than ever. And my antidepressants are not helping me at all.

 I wasted so much money on dr appointments and creams, pills and other medical treatments and nothing works. I used to be confident and i used to be able to mange my work and life. I’ve become a zombie. I can’t think about smth else other than my acne. I can’t work, I can’t study, i’ve missed a lot of classes this semester because i was too depressed and ashamed to go out(i’m in my last year of college). 

I’m thinking about dropping out . I no longer have friends because i didn’t get out of my house for the past 7 months. I just didn’t want them to see my face. I don’t like to cover it with makeup because I know it will look like shit and still be obvious. I lost 8 kg in 2 months just from stress.

Every night i have nightmares related to my acne. I dream it’s getting worse. I wake up panicking and sweating and I run to the mirror to see if it got worse overnight. Sleeping pills prescribed by my psychiatrist are not helping me sleep. I have a panic attacks at least once a day and i need to take an anxiolytic to calm down. 

My parents and my boyfriend are worried but they don’t understand why i am like this. I only hangout with them indoors but i rarely get out of my room and when i do i make sure the lights are dimmed and i wear a hood or smth else because i don’t like to be seen . Not even by them. As you’ve guessed my sex life is kinda non existent and when i rarely do it with my bf i make sure it’s pitch dark and really don’t enjoy it because i feel disgusting and ugly. I do it more for him but he doesn’t know. I don’t want to worry him even more.

I can’t explain why it affects me so much but i know it does. I feel like a burden for my family. I just want to get back to my old self, when i felt pretty and i could go out without feeling ashamed.
I know there are many people dealing with this but i swear they are so strong. I am not and as much as i’ve tried to be patient hoping it would go away i just can’t do it anymore. All i wish is to close my eyes and never wake up. I’m thinking of taking a bunch of sleeping pills and end it all i swear."

I stare at my wall imagining all the ways i could die without hurting anyone. I dont want to be here. I dont know who i am. I am what everyone’s perception of me is how i feel. I dont know who i am and im scared i never will. My mind doesn’t understand whats real or not anymore. Whats wrong with me? I ask myself every day constantly. I dont want to build myself anymore Im tired. Who am I? A little girl that has never known home. Not even in my mothers embrace do i feel soft. Im scared. I want to go home but ive never known where that was. Am I home? Why do i hate being alone. My skin crawls at that thought. Would she be okay? My cat whos only ever known me. If i were to never come back would she be fine? Shes strong she would be okay. How would I do it. A car accident. I always say i would never but why do i think about it so often. Drinking makes it worse but its the only way I can socialize. At the end of it I regret each decision i can think of. A day of saddness. Sulking in my own pity. A sorry excuse I tell myself. That is what I am. Im not here to find happiness. Im here to guide it for others. Im not ment to find myself. Im not even my own person. I cant stand it."

Now she feels even worse and says she wants to leave home. We don't know what to do because we fear that she won't take her medications and that she will try to commit suicide Again, I would like to ask for advice on how to deal with a person with depression and if you could recommend books to inform us more and help her.

The doctor said so, so he believes it.  


But recently, I had a debate with him about Depression and he stated it was a state of mind. After his explanation, I asked if he was hearing this from himself or other people online who call themselves ""Alphas"". He then proudly told me how they don't call themselves Alphas cause they are and how it's from them. He told me how no one can be depressed but are just lazy and believe they can't do anything and how they should just ""Get over it""  


This hurt a lot since I have a lot of friends who struggle with depression, including my boyfriend who has vented to me about his mental state and to hear my little brother say these things made me want to cry and punch him in the face for saying such nonsense. I'm a very empathetic person and Empathize with the pain someone feels when struggling with depression so this felt as though he was attacking me as well.  


It hurt even more when he brought up our cousin's sui\*ide attempt due to depression saying she was in the wrong state of mind and it would've been better if she wasn't such a lazy person. I actually couldn't speak to him and didn't understand why he thought this way and idk if it's cause he's 12 since that's the excuse everyone is giving for this behavior.

190zimu,Depression,2024-01-07,My story,"
I’ve always had depression since I was a teenager but just fought it on my own. I fought it on my own because I went to counselling after attempting suicide and the counsellor told me to “just get over it”. After 8 years on my first suicide attempt, I lapsed and was close again. Fought through it and few years later, met my to be wife. I’ve been with my wife for 10 years, married for 2 and we’ve had a child for over 1 year. The 8 years we were together, barely had an argument or falling out. After getting married, we decided to move closer to her family so when we start a family, we’ve got support nearby. At the time, I didn’t realise that I would loose a lot of my social life to speak to friends about things. We also decided that my wife would not return to work as my salary would be able to cover us. 

The past year since having our daughter has been extremely hard for me. The first 6 months was hard on us all because we didn’t know she had a dairy allergy. My wife would be angry and shout at me, my daughter or our dog. But wouldn’t get angry at her family. I said at the time that she’s depressed and I even asked her mum for help, but was told she’s not. (My wife admits she was depressed now). At the time this happened, a lot of things were changing at work and people leaving left, right and center. Making me feel anxious about my job and where would the money come from if I get given my notice. 

I admit that I was distant with my daughter and then later on became distant with everyone. Normally, before my daughter was born, my wife would relay on me to sort things out and pretty much plan everything. When my daughter was born, I hadn’t a clue and switched roles. Looking back, I think she still wanted that support but I was always waiting on her to tell me what to do. Whenever she did ask, I did it, just never offered.  Because of my actions, my wife then became more and more distant from me. 

After a while, stressing from work, problems at home, it was getting to me and I either wanted to sleep all the time, do nothing, or focus on house diy stuff to get me away from my wife. Me and my wife would barely have a conversation when it was just us. We would sit opposite ends of the sofa and just wait until it’s bedtime. I lost my wife and only friend. 

After many arguments and feeling like I had no one, paying for everything so my wife and daughter had food, heating and roof over their heads, not getting anything in return, we ended up talking about divorce. Once again, I was the blame for everything. This was another low point in my life where I really did want to give up. Even today after months of feeling like this, I constantly think that no one would really care. The only people that would suffer would be my daughter and my dog. I want my daughter to have everything. If it wasn’t for her and being afraid of ending it, I wouldn’t be here telling you my story. 

Back to December, feeling low and pretty much accepting that our marriage was over, I asked my wife if this is it or do we try one more time and let’s see a counsellor? She agreed and we both went. We discussed our pasts and counsellor highlighted issues that we both have to blame for the relationship to end this way. We both came away thinking it was a positive session and wanting more. We were given tasks to do which my wife didn’t end up doing them all. One of my tasks was to give my daughter baths so I can have bonding time with her. This was mainly a want from my wife and the counsellor agreed. 

We had another session and the counsellor focused on my wife with what was concerning her (gaining weight) and then turned to my depression and past. 

Fast forward again, it’s been a month since our first session, I’ve noticed that my wife will not say “love you” without me saying it first. I feel like this is an auto response and she doesn’t actually mean it. Same with kissing. First day back at work, I do my normal routine( come home, sort tea out for both of us, walk the dog) I wanted to make sure that I bath my daughter because I haven’t done it after work before. Once I start bathing her, my wife then comments and says “you’re only doing it so you don’t have to do the washing up”. This happens a lot when my wife would criticise me for doing something even though she’s done. Like this in this instance, want me to bath our daughter but then criticise me for doing it. 

A few nights have passed and I asked her on how she feels about the counselling. Is it working etc. she said “it’s ever so slightly improved” and she thinks we should increase the gap between sessions as it’s a lot of money. It’s not like it’s her money that’s paying for it, it’s mine. After me saying that I think we should continue it as planned because the relationship hasn’t improved, she said that really I should only go because it’s my depression that has caused it all. I mentioned that the counsellor highlighted issues from both of us and as always, my wife will not accept fault. I accept that my depression is partly to blame but really upsets me is I always seem to be the blame for everything and what I think doesn’t matter. 

This has sent me to rock bottom again. All day I have pretended like nothing but I feel like the relationship is over. I’m constantly thinking who gives one if I’m gone. What is the point when I’m not happy really. I’m fooling myself in thinking I’ll be happy again. I don’t have family and certainly don’t have any friends who care. 

Right now, I just think there’s no hope and just give up."

190z1py,Depression,2024-01-07,Why do I de-escalate conflict but then get mad at myself for not standing up?,"This seems to be a pattern with me. If there is a disagreement with a complete stranger: someone being rude over nothing or over something petty. I immediately take the high road while inside to deescalate and I feel a flush of guilt, anxiety, fear as if everyone is watching and I am at the wrong. Once it’s over, my mind keeps repeating the incident with a what if scenario of what I should have done. Told them they are wrong, fight back etc.. That, in return, makes me get into other conflicts since my mindset is so focused on a negative interaction. If I try really hard I can push through my anxiety to fight or be just as petty once the scenario arises again with someone. I think my fear is social anxiety and embarrassment.

All of a sudden at the start of the year I've been getting extremely depressed. I really don't want to get into but long story short I've fallen completely in love with girl who is asexual and has no plans to have a partner.

It's literally all my fault for feeling like complete and utterly depressed. Idk why I'm posting I guess I'm looking for some kind words or just some people to call me an idiot in hopes my depression will go away. I just feel so pathetic for letting myself feel this over girl.

I hate feeling this way and have never dealt with these emotions before. If you'd tell me that I'll feel this way again soon I'd rather honestly fill myself with weed and alcohol until I feel better.

I know I know not a good coping mechanism but it's either that or Kurt Cobaining myself. 

Idk I think I'm just overthinking this and just being cry baby about it. Like wah wah your depressed because you're in love with a long time friend when there's literally thousands of people her dealing with actual problems. Feel free to drop advice or make fun. Anyways not like anyone will pay attention to me anyway

190yliu,Depression,2024-01-07,I'm not sure how much more I can take......,"My life is falling apart all around me and I: 'm not holding it together very well. I lost my job in November, had a stress-related heart attack in December, and lost another job because of that. Unemployment hasn't come through yet and then my boyfriend broke up with me yesterday. He says I did something I didn't do, but whatever. I did get a job, but it doesn't start until Jan 22 and I am out of food, out of money, and out of the will to do much. A lot of nights I wish to go to sleep and not wake up. I feel like it would be easier that way. I don't know how to get out of this damn hole that I seem to be stuck in. I've been sober for a little over three years and now all of a sudden it seems like a great idea to go get fucked up. I mean why not? What difference would it make at this point? My landlord also wants me out by Feb 1st and that's hard to do with no money. I don;t want to be homeless, I just can't find any help out there. My depression is eating me up and its winning. I can't fight it. I just wanna lay down and sleep forever. That;s all. "

Other people would be born with talent, good looks, some are blessed with good muscle genetics. Some can dance, some can sing. But I'm clumsy. Other people are born giveted but I got Hydrocele! Seriously?!?!  I had to get Hydrocelectomy as a toddler. So my mom dropped out of college (almost a nurse) to take care of me . And my dad had to go to Manila to get better opportunity. Just so he could pay for my Hydrocelectomy, imagine all that, just for me to be a bad kid. I'm a terrible son. If I didn't exist my parents life could have been better. 

For those asking, Hydrocele is a condition where a wet socket in your balls that causes the swelling and makes your balls bigger

( Im not saying I'm ugly, I'm like 25% good looking)

I am 17 now and Am dealing with small problems but is probably a big deal for me:

I wish I had good voice, (many of my friends are gifted but are shy/ man If was in there position, I would have taken every opportunity to sing)

Wish I could dance

I wish I don't fvck things up in everything that I do

I wish I get through this semester.
( I don't even wish to be smarter, I can just study)

Sad reality: hardwork will never beat talent
You can't beat someone who's naturally better at what they do


No matter what I do, there will always be someone who's always one step ahead of me, even with the things I like to do, there is always someone who does it better. I love editing shit but I found it pointless since someone is better at it.

Wish I wasn't such a loser

As for romance, I did have a little bit of it, I'm pissed of girls telling mey they like me. What do you like about me? I don't even like myself, it insults me. Those are just platonic feelings. You'll just dump me when you found someone better.

There's this girl who told me taht she likes me, and I really thought she did, but I didn't act. I didn't do moves and eventually she found someone better, see. I'm a clown. I don't know why being mean and vaping is better than me.

Sigma Male tiktoks doesn't actually work

I won't even wish for happiness, I just wish for a little less pain.

Dedication beats motivation, smth I don't have.

I am also pressured and I'm scared to fail, especially since I'm on 11th grade, almost college and things keep getting harder and harder.

Since I am firstborn, I'm scared to fail because my family believes in me(bitch I don't even know what course to pick)

And I can't find anaything I'm good at.

And I see my cousins, peers, peopel who are better than me that my parents keep comparing me to, why don't you just adopt them, disown me. You knew I was gonna be shit but you didn't abort me. Y'all would have better lives if you didn't choose to have me


Sometimes I would think of dying (not suicide/ it's stupid, problems won't disappear if you kill yourself/ It'll just burden someone else). Just thinking of scenario to die but in useful way

I'm worthless, I'm a pile of shit, I could go on and yap about my problems but it'll take a while

And besides, I'm 17 anyway. I shouldn't make a big deal about it since I'm a guy and maybe it's just a phase.

There are other people who's got bigger problems than me."
190y70b,Depression,2024-01-07,I feel like a bad person pretending to be good,"But at this point I don’t care anymore; I used to be so anxious when this thought came up. I pretend to be nice but I know I’m not like that in reality. I smile when I want to to seem kind but I’m not.

 I like to bully others to prove to them that I’m right, whether it be opinions or their interests. (I tell them that their opinion is wrong). I was a bad kid and  really sensitive. One time when I was 12 I poured water on my dad because I was really angry at him. 

When people are slightly neutral towards me I think that they must have sensed that the real me is bad so they stay away. I self harm sometimes because I hate myself. Is it narcissism? I’ve been to a psychologist and they said it wasn’t likely. But they might be wrong. Most days I feel empty. Sometimes Im ashamed of myself. I’m both ugly on the outside and inside. I self sabotage because I think I don’t deserve success. 

What can I do? Is there hope for me to be better?"
190y5bo,Depression,2024-01-07,I have no energy or motivation to do anything but i know exactly what I need to be doing. I just can't do it and I can't fake a smile," Am I lazy?
I quit my extremely high paying job because it was too physically exhausting and my boss was abusing her power. I am now working as a kennel attendant at a animal hospital for shit ass pay and it's boring. I'm so exhausted but in a different way than I was before. It's like I do nothing all day but pick up shit and I get home and do nothing but sit on my phone. I just got an apartment and I live alone. If I didn't have my savings from my last job there's no way I can afford my new place. I used to live with my parents. I'm living in the negatives. 
Things are objectively much better than they were a year ago but everything still sucks in nearly every aspect of my life.
I have no one to talk to because I fell out with my best friend and have no one else but my boyfriend and I tell him way too much already. He's not a therapist. It's not his responsibility and I don't expect him to be able to help me in any meaningful way that a therapist would. He has his own bs to deal with. But it pains me that I can't fake a smile or make happy conversation and funny banter everyday. Then I'm left with no choice but to tell him I'm feeling down. And it's like ""ughh again??"" He doesnt act like it but he tells me he feels hopeless in helping me. I'm feeling down every day and it's getting extreamly exhausting. 
Why can't I just fake a happy text message?? I'm going to have to fake it and I'm exhausted just thinking about it. 

I'm trying to find a new job.
I'm trying to find a therapist.
I'm trying to journal my emotions.
Im trying to do my 15 hobbies I've completely abandoned.
I'm trying to bullet journal and keep track of daily habits and things I need to do.

But really I just sit on the couch on my phone.

190y4hn,Depression,2024-01-07,I always feel like no one understands me.,"Hi,My name zack. I grow up in Thailand. My life was okay when I was baby until I grow up.
My dad started beat me. My mom called me devil and my brother blame me for doing a little mistake. Three of them always argument each other. This madness was around grade 1-7. 

As I thought it gonna be better,No it not. First thing that make me wanna punch them that they never apologise. They never be honest with me. If I don't ever asked them to apologise. It always like that. Sometimes they don't even apologise. My dad has a shitty statement where he can hurt me but when I tell him anything that doesn't go on his way or the truth. He don't apologise and act like a toxic. He blame me. My brother my mom never apologise too but at least they changed to become better. But that don't stop there.

 When I was grade 8. My dad try to destroy my mental health by saying thing that will piss me off and keep talking bad. And a lot of it make me hurt other ppl without realising. I hurt my firend I hurt my mom I hurt my brother. I honestly don't regret hurt my dad he just asshole to me. Now there a firend who call inc. I hurt him badly by always toxic to him like ""why you don't talk to me"" ""why you don't care about me"" ""did you hate me or what"" ""do you even care about me"".
This argument continues endlessly for 3 month. He blocked me. He said fuck off. Then he never text me again. I don't know why I do this to him. I also hurt my another firend who name melody. She probably hate me by now. She blocked me too. I deserve it
But that doesn't end here. My girlfirend cheating on me with my closet firend. The worst part that I think it my fault but it is thier fault. and affer both even ppl started to far away from me. 


Sure some ppl stay with me but Tbh I wanna die ever since then but keep living it not about past it is how it still continues. I feel so loneliness and when I want ppl who truly care me. They never exists
They always make excuse and making me lie about myself. ""Yeah they don't care about me"" just kill myself already. They just to play or talk with someone. While i want them to heal me. I help a lot of ppl but the thing I got is discredit sometimes. I don't expect reward but I do expect no discredit. You know what is the worst? I'm alone and die alone. No one ever compliment me or try to put thier heart on me. No one. I put my heart on them but look what I got? Do I need to wait for someone to acknowledge me? Why why it always like this. They maybe busy but it never make sense.

Why do I deserve this shit? Why can't I just die already. My pain never stop it endlessly. First I have confidence issue but now I have also scared of ppl and now I have trust issue and can't move on goddammit who left me like 2. (Inc and melody)

I tried to fixed. Do wrong right. Do what I think it best yet. It never good enough. It always bad and bad for other ppl. Someone always outsmart me. Always better at control feeling. Always better than me.
I have no talent. I have no passion. Most importantly I have no purpose or goal.
Soulless machine wait for day to come and die die die. I wanna commit suicide many time. Thing always make me feel bad. It keeping bad and bad. Sometimes it was very bad sometimes it wasn't. And rarely it was okay and happy. I can't even sleep. 

For ppl who reading untill now and sitll not judge me.
I really appreciate you. I know I made a lot of mistake as well can't solve problems very well and doing poorly decisions.
You still not judge me. Thanks you.
That me me feel great.
I really hate living and I wanna die and free but I can't. I still scared what happened if  wake again and I had to stuck in bed forever.
What if I die but I wake in some place where dark and lonely. This is enough of loneliness. I don't want to stay in the dark. 
Anyways thanks you for listening.
I wish j could have someone who truly care about me."

190xq8g,Depression,2024-01-07,"what to do, i feel hopeless.","Before anything I’m not really looking for a an answer or a solution for my problem, maybe some advice. 

I’m 24F. 
I’ve wanted to become en English teacher ever since I was in 8th grade, so around 13 years old if i’m not wrong. I had a clear plan in mind: choose literature in high school, after graduation do a 3-year degree that would lead me to the teaching masters degree and that would be my life. Easy right? I thought so too. That was until I did an internship at a high school and realised I really hated all about it, from then on it just went downhill: I started worrying about my future like crazy to the point of having a burnout in 2020. 

I realised I didn’t know what to do next in life, and as someone who liked to have everything planned it was hell for me. I had to figure out what to do while trying to get my degree in the middle of the pandemic and while trying to get a job I didn’t need but wanted just so I didn’t feel useless during summer and during my gap year. 

It all led to me being diagnosed with a burnout and later depression and chronic anxiety. 

So I spent days and months searching for schools, degrees that I could do with the degree I already had. I didn’t want to have to redo another 3 years to get another degree and another 2 after that to get a masters degree. (it’s the french system)

When I finally found a school and a masters I could enter directly without having to redo any other degrees, I wasn’t as happy as I thought I would be but I succeeded the entry exams. At the same time my anxiety was starting to develop more making me incapable of staying in a job, I would have anxiety attacks and would start wishing I was home and it drove me crazy. 

So I managed to get my first semester at that school for a communication and marketing degree, the second semester was supposed to be an internship that was hell to find because I live far from a paris and couldn’t stay alone (was taking anti depressants.) 
I tried three different internships but every time I would go, I would start having trouble breathing and having anxiety attacks. So each time I gave up. That was in March 2022. I tried again in july but only managed to stay one week before my brain told me i hated it and wanted to stay home so I just gave up again. 

If you’re seeing a pattern you’re right, from then on every time I would get a job even a babysitting one I would have an anxiety attack and just leave and come home. 

I managed to finish the first year of that masters degree working from home. 

And every since last year i’ve been trying to get jobs, but every time I would go and pass the first recrutement appointment I end up not saying yes to them (I find all kinds of excuse to not like the job: because it’s far, because i didn’t like the vibe…)

So it’s been a year and a half almost, I started going to my psychiatrist again less than six months ago, but I didn’t think I needed the antidepressants so I just didn’t take them for four months (I know i’m stupid). 

So now it’s been 2 months and I managed to get two jobs but the same thing keeps happening. 

My psychiatrist tells me i’m doing what’s called in french “de l’évitement” basically means avoiding and I want to get better but even thinking of being 3 hours somewhere that is not home makes me anxious and sounds impossible. 

I live at my parents house and before you tell me I’m useless and all that I know i’m useless. And I really want to change that. I don’t want to be a burden to my mum who’s going through a divorce and is still paying for my college debt and being there for me emotionally, she’s really the best.


I can’t go to therapy bc it’s hella expensive and i wouldn’t want to make my mother pay.

I have an amazing boyfriend of 4 years that lives two hours away and would like me to move there but i need to have a job so we can afford to rent a house. 

I want to become a social media manager and finish my masters degree but I don’t have the motivation to create a portfolio or to work in something that requires some kind of creativity. So i wonder if I should start coding, or something similar because that would get me a job working from home but i don’t even know if i have the motivation to do it.  

I really don’t know what i’m hoping for, maybe a piece of advice. 

Thanks to whoever reads all of this."
190xpl8,Depression,2024-01-07,Masking my depression,"Hi reddit,

To be honest I've never written on here and am new to reddit, but I need advice and can't really talk to anyone I know about this. Also this is a bit of a vent, but trigger warning: mental health, depression, suicide, cancer. Sorry for the long post. 

To set the scene I believe I have struggled with depression since 5/6th grade (I am now a junior in high school). While I have never been officially diagnosed, I continuously check the boxes for depression. There are periods where it can get really bad and I have suicidal thoughts; but never self harm, never made a plan or acted out on my thoughts; and other times where my depression has, I guess you could say, calmed down... However, within the past couple years (starting at the begining of highschool) it started to get the worst it has ever been. I will add in that my mother was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer at the beginning of my freshman year and passed away that spring. And to be real we were never that close and so I didn't really feel like I had ""lost a loved one"" or ""someone close to me"". It just felt like a distant family member had passed. Yes I know that you might be rolling your eyes saying that there's no way that losing your mother didn't affect you a lot but to be honest I was never extremely sad about it. Which may be a problem in itself, but I've grieved over her and obviously still am a bit but it doesn't really make me depressed. Over all though, I have a pretty good life. I am a privileged white girl, who doesn't have any financial problems to deal with, group of friends, good grades and I live in a wealthy area. To add on I have a therapist, that I see weekly and can talk with her about anything.

However this is where my problems begin. I have been seeing her for about 1.5 years? I honestly can't remember but its been at least that amount of time. Within all the times I've seen her I've maybe cried a total of 4 times and can't almost ever tell her anything that is seriously going wrong (my depression and anxiety). Not because I feel that she will be judgemental about it but that I have trouble admitting that I struggle and that things are going wrong in my life and I just mask everything to make it seem like everything is going well. I have told her about issues with my dad (he has anger issues, but he isn't physical, just can sometimes be verbally abusive), which she has helped me deal with. I've also talked to her about surface level issues, like stupid boy problems, or other troubles with other people, but I've never been able to truly explain how they affect me, if they are making me depressed.

The last couple months I've become extremely depressed, somewhat out of nowhere and also because its junior year and also almost all my friends became shitty people to me. During this time I've tried so hard to bring up my depression to my therapist. I've also tried to give her hints but she just kind of seems to not completely comprehend them. I did bring up once that I felt kinda depressed but the next time I saw her I began masking again and really only focus on the positive parts of my life. This is my problem. I can't stop masking in front of her, it has become a habit to only share the good parts. This has lead to my therapist thinking that I am doing great. What made me really realize this was a serious issue was, our last session where I wanted so bad to tell her about how depressed I am but I fell into masking mode and even at the end of our session she said that she's so proud of me to see that I'm doing great and that I'm glowing; which I feel like could be anything but the truth. So reddit, I am asking, how can I tell my therapist the truth about my depression with my masking problem? Any advice? also none of my friends/anyone know that I struggle with depression. 

thanks!"
190xo0v,Depression,2024-01-07,I’m just an empty shell…,"Istg the people in my life has just drained the life out of me. Now I feel nothing, love nothing, love no one, I feel nothing for anything. I’m just here waiting for god to have pity on me and just take my life away. Can’t even kill myself cause I’m too much of a coward. What was even the point of my creation? I see all these posts about the beauty of love and life, like let’s cut the bs and be real, you can only experience that beauty if you’re rich enough."
190xmn7,Depression,2024-01-07,I have been struggling,"I was diagnosed with depression 2 years back and I have been on medications since then, I am better in a lot of aspectsbut I am still struggling in the academics, it’s very difficult for me to sit and study, my retention is zero and I have to read everything multiple times to understand it, I am able to focus but it feels like nothing is going inside my brain and I am just reading for the sake of it, idk what to do"
190xi41,Depression,2024-01-07,"I figured out why I’m depressed, but I don’t know how to get out","For a while I wasn’t sure. And my counselor told me there is always a unique thinking pattern that drives depression. I wasn’t really sure what it is. I got to college, everything is fine; but I struggle to do basic self care and motivate myself to do anything. I have a difficult family situation but I left that now and I’m here in college.

Until I realized what it is. A year  ago I had an awful trip. True nightmare fuel. In it I came to the realization that my life is actually a nightmare. That I’m living a dark dream and that none of this can be real. I couldn’t pin what it was that was hurting me so badly about my life. But then I realized it’s my family.

My family situation is a nightmare. Without them I’m unhappy and scared of the world; and with them around I’m miserable but not scared of the world. I don’t feel as lonely, but feel devastated. It dawned on me there is no escape. I was born into the nightmare of a bad family situation. And when I think what would just make me happy and cope with all the bad things that happened to me. It’s if I had a family. If I had a loving family maybe I’d be more well adjusted. Everyday I wake up to this terrible dream that I don’t have a family that’s loving, but that’s all I need to live.

I don’t know what to do. I don’t think there’s a way out. I can’t create a chosen family if I’m so fucked up that my relationship skills and absent. There’s no way out, and I’m depressed about it."
190x9m4,Depression,2024-01-07,Depression does NOT make an artist better,"All it does is make me not do art.

I look at art I made in the past, think it's good, and curse myself for quitting so long ago.

I'm rusty now. All my tools look foreign, from my drafting pencils to photoshop. I have no idea what to do with them/how to work them anymore, and my motivation to practice is at zero. All I can do is look at the blank piece of paper (or digital canvas), feel overwhelmed by the possibilities, then my brain shuts down and I can't put anything on it.

I made a pattern in photoshop somehow, but can't figure out how to color it. I don't even think it's good really. I kind of hate it. I'm not satisfied with the techniques I used. My artist partner/friends tell me it's good but I don't believe them, not really.

So I thought I would look it up online for support: depression affecting artists. I expected to find support groups or something but instead I got the dopey &amp; tropey ""depression makes good artists"" from websites like psychology today, verywell mind. Like ""depression makes art better!!!!! all the good artists of the past had depression, and their art was better for it!!!!""

No. NO. NONONONONONONO **NO**!!!!!!!!

All my depression does is make me hate myself, everything I do, everything I make, and everyone around me. Depression isn't some artistic quirk where you trade happiness to make beautiful work! All it fucking does is make me not make anything, make me suffer, make me hate my work so much that I can't finish anything. I'm trying to get back into it slow, practicing fundamentals like figure drawing or just doodling, but my motivation is so low I can't even do that sometimes.

I feel so unhappy, unloved, unwanted, all the time, and I can't make art anymore. And even when I do, it's not fun anymore. Depression has stolen my ability to feel joy. I'm slowly getting it back due to therapy, psych, medication, but it's a slow process and it still feels like I'm scraping by moment to moment every single fucking day.

Depression isn't an art enhancer. Artists with depression aren't ""stronger/better"" for having depression. Depression is bad in any context.

Fuck depression. Fuck these weird psychology websites that peddle this bullshit."

190wqbs,Depression,2024-01-07,I want to kill myself,"Hello, above all I'm sorry if this is wrong place where I'm writing this, I just don't know where else to write this. I'm also sorry if my English grammar is not good.

So I'm 16 years old teenager, that's just first months in my new high school. Everything is fine in school, just I've got problem. I don't know why but I'm starting to be really sad. First of all, I'm travelling 40km to school by train, and in that train is one girl that is 1year older than me, she was even in my elementary school. She's making fun of me in train, and I don't know what to fu*king do. I'm 100% stronger than her, but the problem is, if I talk back, she will definitely start a conflict, and I'm afraid of conflicts because she could have a knife with herself, if we accidentally fought. Also if I would hit her or something, she would call her friends and for sure they would beat me up. I'm travelling with my friend and my girlfriend. I'm even scared of my girlfriend when I'm not there so they wouldn't fight. But, my girlfriend is smart, and she won't be fighting with her. But I'm the problem, I'm scared of that girl. Even she says a word to me I'm already shaking. I'm nervous to even go to school because of her, I am thinking of her all day, and can't get her out of my head. 

Another thing is different thema, it's about games, I have need for playing games, I love them as every teenager does. But the problem is, if I loose only once in that game, I'm going insane, I'm starting to bite myself in arm that hardly, that sometimes blood is coming out. When I finish raging, I cry. I cry out of nowhere, I am thinking about killing myself. I'm really damaged, maybe someone won't understand my feelings, but I'm damaged so much. But everyone thinks I'm happy. 

Maybe this all could be trauma from childhood, when I was small, my dad was alcoholic and he was hitting my mom and was swearing on me always, back then I don't remember when he was sober in my childhood. But now he's a good dad, he stopped drinking alcohol and he's doing well in his job and also he's teaching me new things in garage. But, the trauma, it will never go away.

From this all, I just cry, cry, cry, cry and cry. I always cry but I don't show it anyone that I do cry. I don't want anyone to see me crying. Similar problems what I mentioned here has my cousin, but she's not living with me, she's away from us.
She is having serious depressions and taking pills, but I feel like it's not helping her. And I feel like I'm starting to have depression too. If I would not have my family that loves me, I'm definitely killing myself. But my family needs me.

So can someone tell me, how could I solve that? It is hard to solve and please I don't want any mean comments. I came here because I want help, should I go to psychologist ? I don't know. Please help. Thank you for reading this."

190w9om,Depression,2024-01-07,18M How do I fucking cope???,"This is the last straw. I'm so fucking done with this bullshit, I've been trying to mask myself happy and bubbly and stuff trying to convince myself I'll manage. But god my family is a mess, everybody split up. Can financially support my little sister but can't for me despite being an unemployed father and telling me he can't afford my basic needs such as education despite me already scramming for pennies (I live in a third world country wow so amazing! Glad you're so proud of your country dad that doesn't have It's citizen in mind!) And idk do I just become a drop out student making minimum wage and living out the rest of my life being broke in a smelly shared living??? 

I'm a mess I'm breaking down I was already stressed out with important documents, how I'll manage with money and now my fucking birth certifcate is lost?!! I know It's no big deal but god everything cost money and time and It's not easy to pop out in thin air especially barely having any cash. This sucks man I have no person I can turn in to just so I can cry out I feel no security in my environment I always have to make sure I'm prepeared or I'll ruminate for hours not being able to make any progress.

Just all the pent up frustration building up until this happen, my fucking birth certifcate of all things to pop the bubble. I've been contemplating maybe overdosing myself just die, everybody around me is just easy go and chill and fun and happy but the moment shit turns up they all disperse not giving a shit. I just want someone to make me feel that there's nothing to worry about that I feel safe but no. Not even my own god darn father can provide financially security.

I feel unwanted and have to prove myself just so my father to invest in me??????? Having grandparent who are conservative who thinks gays are a sin, wanting me to play a gender norm? All of them can go fuck off! All I really wanted in life was stability in terms of mental, financial, physical and relationship with other people. I've been off of my anti depressant to numb my feelings just so I can ignore everything but the moment I turned 18 I know it was bound to catch up all my problems in my life. I feel like a screw up, I just wanna give up, die in my sleep. Maybe taking all the meds I have right now and sleep and never wake up, maybe I'll have more courage this time to do so. Just lock my room up, barricade everything and whatever happens happened."
190w3ij,Depression,2024-01-07,Get motivated to do things you don’t want to,"Tl;dr I dread taking my dogs on walks. How can I improve my attitude towards it

We have two dogs. Even though I live with my wife and kid, the dogs have become my sole responsibility ever since I was laid off from work. I feed them both times every day, play with them, take them for walks. I do love the dogs, there’s just one thing I hate doing: the walks. I dread them. It actually makes me angry to do it. I look forward to the days when it rains so I don’t have to do it. I know I shouldn’t be angry for something so trivial but with my depression the lack of motivation and overall sadness makes it a chore. My family doesn’t help and yes I resent this. I stopped asking because it does no good. If I don’t take care of the dogs’ needs it won’t get done. I care too much for animals to see them go without the things they need. My question is, how do I turn my mindset around for things I don’t want to do at all, like when it comes to things like walks? I have to do them, I’m just tired of hating it."
190w2qg,Depression,2024-01-07,I've been depressed my entire life. They lied. Getting older doesn't make it better.,"I've never been completely happy . From the time of consciousness, I've never been happy. As a matter of fact I've always been sad. Internally lonely. Delusioned. No mental peace. 

Each year as I got older, my depression would reach certain heights. Get more extreme. 

Around 19 years old, one morning, I woke up and decided I wanted to die. I chugged bunches of sleeping pills and some liquor I found in the kitchen cabinet. I then went back to sleep. I would've succeeded, honestly. My grandma and mom came back from the grocery store . My grandma had somehow made it into my room and accosted me into the bathroom tub . Threw me into some cold water. 

I threw up a bunch. That was the second time I had committed suicide. 

I'm 25 and it's not better. I have moments where I burst in tears. I also realized I'm truly alone. When you're a teenager, you attend school by force. You get to still have some interaction amongst people. Though when you get older, its not like that at all. You can go days and months without speaking to anyone and anyone speaking to you. People can ignore you. Not read your text. People can reject you. As you get older. So reaching out for help can absolutely be useless. 

I don't know what to think anymore. I don't know what to do. I'm kinda tired of it. Trying to find something to pull me out of my mental issues. They never last long. How can someone spend their entire life trying to convince themselves that they should keep living ? How do you convince someone of such a thing and continue to do it over and over and over again. Isn't it a tiresome thought. Who in all sanity should have to make themselves feel like life is worth it? 

That's a sick existence."

I am also a nicotine user. Smoked pot every day for about a year too but i quit since then.

Everyday I keep waking up wishing I was dead due to laziness, fatigue, and mild post psychosis trauma. I keep seeing stories of lazy men depending on their parents for income, being too afraid of driving, and jobless. 

They all fit the description of what my life will be. I've seen it in front of my eyes with a lazy father who complained and did nothing his entire life. I feel like I wasn't raised properly and I just want to change my life for the better but I suffer from so many delusions and it's difficult to break free. 

I really want to be independent and strong but mental illnesses and being poorly raised with pity has effected me badly. I'm too tired and lazy to do a 9 to 5. Thankfully I'm still in college but I just need to start doing things but I don't know how.

I genuinely want to be married but I don't want to torture a woman. My mother's been through a lot and she didn't deserve it. Can anyone give me advice on where to start?

My heart, which has no more to give, pumps one last time for good. In 100 years, those who have grown up with me will be dead. This thought has helped mask my guilt if I ever carry out my thoughts. There will be no me anymore one day regardless. Unfortunately for myself, it might be sooner than those around me. I hope I get to see people again after I go. I fear what the afterlife holds.

190u88g,Depression,2024-01-07,The past few days I’ve been battling with wanting to kms,"I turn thirty in a week and I’ve never been more unhappy. I grew up in a very traumatic home, got married when I was 19 to a man who was very controlling and mean, and then met the love of my life after my divorce and after a year of dating got pregnant. During my pregnancy he started drinking heavily and become physically abusive. I had a really difficult pregnancy and me and my son almost died during childbirth. After the birth, everything in my life felt like it was coming together. I had just gotten my dream job at my alma mater, we had just bought a house, and I had this beautiful baby boy that was perfect. I spoke to my SO and told him he was unwell (the drinking, the abuse, and his mental health) and that he needed to go to some type of treatment center to get help. He agreed but said he wasn’t gonna go anywhere. I decided to leave and told him I wouldn’t come back until he got the help he needed and I had fully recovered from the birth. He got angry and started making threats and filed for custody with the courts. Since I had left the state the law was on his side, but because if the threats he had made I didn’t want to return. I had to quit my job, left all my belongings behind and he refused to give them back, and had to move back in with my toxic parents. But at least me and my son were safe. A few months later he got pulled over for drunk driving and went home and shot himself. Since we weren’t married, I didn’t get the house or anything. His family blamed me for his death and banned me from attending the funeral which made my grief almost impossible to process. 
Since his death, I have been spiraling out. I’m severely depressed and have been for years. I have constant flashbacks to the birth, the abuse, and finding out he died. Every time things start to go okay in life I find a way to sabotage it or it just falls apart one way or another. My mom watched my son most of the time because I struggle with getting out of bed other than to go to work just to make enough to pay my bills. I feel like I’m just going through the motions. Sometimes life doesn’t even feel real to me. The last few days have been especially hard. My grief was really intense during the holiday season, me and my mom got into a huge fight, and my car broke down and I have no way to pay to fix it. I haven’t seen my son in days because of my car and work. I’ve been staring at the bottle of sleeping pills on my night stand every night. I just feel like life is so hard and so unbearable and I see no end to the pain in sight- so death just seems like the on viable option. I keep telling myself that it might get better, but it’s just empty words at this point. I’m alone, I’m depressed, and I’m defeated. I just want to be happy again. I want to have hope. I want to be able to support myself and my son. And more than anything I want to be the mom I was meant to be, but I feel like none of that will ever happen."

Every night you'll dream of how much love and magic used to flood your life, and then you'll wake up without even a trace of it, and let me tell you....THAT feeling will envelope your entire being. Everytime you see a flower, animal or beautiful sunrise it will take you back briefly, but when you come back to the reality of your life...you will go through it all again....and again....and again. Eventually... you're going to feel like you're running out of options, nothing in this world will ever feel like home , your heart yearns for a time and a place that doesn't exist anymore and you would do anything, anything to feel that magic just one more time... and though I would never do anything to hurt myself...

In December however I lost my job and a family member passed away suddenly. Pretty much over night my body just shut down, I still have a regular mood but all can think about is killing myself, I have looked at ways methods and looked into locations, I tried to check into a hospital but they wouldn't admit me, I can't afford my therapist while between jobs( starting end of month), I can't tell me wife as she has enough going on and I just want to stop thinking about killing myself.

190sxfc,Depression,2024-01-07,Constantly triggered ideation by miniscule things.,"I don’t really know what to do. They keep upping my medication, I’m in therapy, I’ve tried a million different meds, I try to use my recommended coping skills, but nothing helps. I’ve found that it’s gotten worse recently, but I’ve sort of always been like this. I constantly feel ‘ passively ‘ suicidal, but it gets inflamed and becomes less passive and more an active thought at even the smallest of things. I get triggered extremely easily. 

Some examples just from the past few days : 

- realized I have to keep going to a physical laundromat for the foreseeable future 

- had to leave a wedding early 

- don’t have safety foods in the house and can’t order out 

- have to start a new job soon. Haven’t even tried the job yet. 

- the world is “ too noisy ”

- people looking at me a way that i deemed rude or weird 

- being asked too many questions 

- fearing I gained too much weight and lose my bidy shape

It makes me irritated, then i get suicidal, and i feel hopeless. There are some bigger things happening right now that I didn’t share, but this has been going on even before. I have had a pretty rough life, but I don’t think small things should be making me feel like I should take all my meds at once. I keep making excuses to live, but I’m running out. 

Why am I like this? Why do I hate myself so, so much? I’m just lost because I feel like I’ve tried what I can try and my therapist just keeps repeating the same coping methods that aren’t working, and apologizing to me."

190aytn,Depression,2024-01-06,Need help please,"Hello, I hope you all are doing fine. 

I will explain my life's story. I'll try to sum it up. For those that want to skip it, go to the conclusion. I'm not good for telling stories so sorry if it will be painful to read.

I was born in 2005. I lived happilly from 2005 to 2013. I was innocent, liked by many and got to grow in a beautiful environnement. At home, I was living with my parents and my older sister to my birth from 2009. She was 14 years old when I was born and she left our home when she reached 18 years old in 2009 which is my age today.

In 2013, my parents decided to move in a neighbouring country because the rent was cheaper even if my sister tried to tell otherwise to our mom. I stayed in a village for 4 years. I suffered from bullying from several classmates in my new school because I was too chubby for them. It was mostly mockery but one time, a kid named Arthur mocked me and kick me on both of my legs. I rarely fought because I always hated fighting so I didn't fight back. I also suffered from knowing nobody and even if I got to make friends, It made me colder and more introverted than I was before. I really didn't feel welcome to that place as I saw the natives of that country as mean people so I searched someone with the same nationality as mine and I did find one person. It sure was racist of me to think like that but I found a very gentle kid, ressembling me a lot in lot of ways. His name was Taylor. He was my first friend I made since I moved out. As time goes, I make other friends but the situation doesn't get better. I'm was still bullied for my size and still seen as a stranger. I felt worthless and didn't appreciated being fat because of the bullying. Around 2015 I started to lose weight because my mom wanted me to know how to swim and when I started to get sick of swimming, she put me in a boxing club. I enjoyed doing it until 2017 when I was transfered with the adults training session.

During the summer vacations of 2017, my mom seperated from my dad and move out to a city, close to the border of my home country. I move out with her as well. At the start of 2018, I was attenting a new kind of school for preteens. I went to the same school as every kid in the village were. I met up with my friends again but my bullies were attenting the same school too. On a good note tough, since I started to lose weight, they left me alone more often than before but they were still unfriendly with me. Sadly, I wouldn't have said much if there wasn't another problem in that school which was the large numbers of problematics students. 2018 was also the year my mom met her now boyfriend name Martin. More of him later.

The same year, I began distancing myself from my group of friends because we had more and more arguments. I started to hang out more with problematic students which made me similar to them. It was a really bizarre moment but basically, I started to be more disobedient towards my teachers and my grades started to fall. I never bullied someone though but still, that didn't ressemble who I really was. I accidently bump into a girl but I didn't apologise due to my shyness and so she started to throw things at me and have an argument with me. Some day later, she kicked my backpack while I was chasing someone that slapped me on my face as a ""joke"". But I didn't want to hit her. I realised I've brought myself lots of problems with teachers and with students. I started to hate living here and told my mom that I wanted to go back to my home country. My sister started to worry for me and insisted the same to our mom. My mom took finally notice of this, even if it was late and in summer of 2019, I moved out again.

Fast forward to 2020, I complety changed who I became. I went back to being a well behaved student. I was in my final year of obligatory school and in my  country, we have the choice to go to high school, do an apprenticeship or going to schools specialized in certain fields like business or social. Those schools don't provide diplomas as valueable has the ones a college would but it would still in most cases, garantee you a job. Anyway, I didn't know what job I wanted to do so my mother pushed me to go to high school so I could have 4 years to decide before choosing what diploma I would want study for and also because she tought I was intelligent enough to pass. My sister, on the other hand pushed me to do an apprenticeship because it would fit me better and make me more indepedent. I decided to pursue high school because my mom's arguments seemed more correct than the ones my sister told me and I was convinced I had the capacity to graduate high school. My english and sports teacher also supported me to study hard to go to high school so I studied as hard as I could to be accepted. I was exhausted already with studying but my efforts paid off.

And so in 2021, I started my first year in High School. It was hard mainly because I'm not good with maths but I did well on the other subjects. Summer of 2021, my mom and her boyfriend Martin wanted to live together in a appartement far from everybody my mom and I knew and worked in except for him. We moved out again.

By 2022, I had to start over again : attend new school, make new friends etc ... except for my studies. I was completing my second year of high school. I started to feel that studying in high school wasn't a good idea and I went for ask for help to my sister. She advices me to try the ""lesser schools"" programs because the school established also proposed those. I had only 3 choices being : social, education (being a teacher) and health. None of those three interested me so I went for the least worse, social. I stopped studying completly in june 2023. The same month, I was diagnosed with Autism and ADHD. 

In Conclusion :

Since 2020, I wanted to kill myself to dissapear from life's mediocrity and my inability to adapt to life. I feel inadequate because I couldn't figure out what job I wanted to do at 15 years old while everyone seemed to know what they were doing. I still can't figure out what job I want to do. I don't understand how the world, no, life stand on it's feet when there's always things contradicting each others. Like for example being a good and kind person is what you should be regardless of beliefs and whatnot because kind people are put on front by life with all kind of signals (karma, heroics figures, stories and simply the nature of some people) but you'll still suffer from something and that, even if you always have being kind your entire life. I never got the courage to do anything to kill myself so here am I, still living but still confused and angry toward life. I imagine sometimes how nice it must be for people not born yet to feel nothing and being in a perfect state, in a perfect environnement while each living creature on Earth stuggles to survive. I also imagine me punching God for his immense incompetence as well sometimes. I feel terrible knowing that I have no clue what job I want to do how impossible it seems to understand life for me. With what I understand of life, if you can't find a job soon enough, you go homeless and then dies because the lifestyle of homeless people don't garantee sucessful survival. So then, I understand that life is either you work so you live or you don't and die and I don't understand why I tell that to my sister, she tells that something is wrong with me. Yet, my sister still hasn't debunked that view and I want someone to successfully debunk it. I don't feel being good enough from the fact that being perfect seems the main goal for humanity while we're living in a imperfect world with limits with imperfect beings.  Why can't we be all born as kind as Mr. Rogers ? Why aren't serial killers, pedophiles, rapists, etc ... entierely removed from society yet ? Why would life be okay to let people like me be born ? Those feelings haven't gone and were at their strongest in june of 2023 and have resurfaced yesterday. My dad was always absent while still existing in my life so he's worthless, My mom only did the surface job of raising a child which mean provinding for my vital needs which isn't enough for properly raising a child so she's a bit less worthless too. Both of them didn't support me on anything and didn't give me any attention. They neglected me. I call them worthless but I am worthless as well. I stopped seeing my father at weekend at 15 years old because his house was dirty, I had to eat what he was eating and I have nothing in common no link with him whatsoever. My mom started screaming and abuse me verbally when I wanted to quit pursuing high school, same as her boyfriend Martin. From that incident, I decided to isolate myself from those two as much as possible. Even when my mom pushed me to do the ADHD and Autism tests, nor she or her boyfriend have changed anything in theirs behaviors to help me be at ease at home. They both don't recognize that they haven't treated me well since I said I wanted to stop pursuing high school and my mom has the audacity to ask me why I despises so much her boyfriend who wants to be the man of the house controlling what me and my mom do. She certainly haven't realised I despises her too but a bit less, that narcissist. I am lucky I have my sister give me all she could that my parents didn't which is attention and raising me. There's no way I can thank her enough for everything she did to me. But with all she did, I still lack in lots of things everybody in life as figured out by this point and lacking in those things is painful because it messed with my relationship with my sister. I don't want to kill myself to hurt my sister but if our relation goes south, there wouldn't be lot of things keeping here honestly and sadly it might go that way. 

We had a discussion yesterday, I told her I was stupid because I completly forgot to go to a bank do something important. I felt I failed at being responsible. Then, she ask me why and I told her that I hadn't prepared myself mentally to do it. At the end of my message, I put Lenin's citation : ""without revolutionary theory, there can't be no revelotionary mouvement"" as I felt it was similar to my situation. She got very upset by it and said that for all this time I hanged with her, I still associated myself with murderers and terribles ideas my parents taught me and that being 18 years old, she couldn't excuse me by saying I'm young and influential. That I didn't take responsability to approach 20th century history with a empathetic look on events like totalitarian political regimes searching how people suffered from nazism, fascism and communism instead of researching how run what, who help Hitler, Stalin etc ... have all this power, etc ... and thus, she said that she loved me but she will not betray who she is for my toxicity because she already lived with the toxicity my parents brought to her. I felt terrible and thought she was absolutely right even if I didn't understand everything she said and that I was sorry, that I would do this to make the situation better. Only here, it was the straw line because it has been years she tried to make me see the world differently my parents did but I haven't had a significant change of views towards some things in life. Even if I have the will to change to be a better person, she doesn't trust me much anymore and in return, I don't as well. I know now where the limit is. I wan't to garantee myself to be indepent to do all of the things you need to do in life but since my parents taught me nothing and my sister couldn't teach me everything, I'm fucked which is my I need your help to :

- Be more of a indepedent person in life in everything necesserary to life 

- How to become a general better person.


Sorry if you don't feel good or else after reading all this.

190rc3o,Depression,2024-01-07,Thinking of deleting myself,"Throwaway account.


Since a child I’ve always had the struggles of making friendships, especially with being diagnosed with ADHD (and other mental health problems that comes get diagnosed with when much older) I was always picked on, no one never wanted to be friends, I always would just end up staying in the house playing by myself, unless I wanted to play outside by myself.
I don’t like talking about this part so I’ll just say I was “sa” and stripped naked. luckily I managed to get away.
Moving into secondary school, this was biggest challenge, school was given prior knowledge of me having learning difficulties etc… ADHD messed with my attempts to learn like the other kids and just want to feel normal but I was neglected the help I required. And if I did something wrong that I couldn’t help nor understand why it was wrong, I would be punished for it. I tried to kill myself when I was about 15 by attempting to cut my own neck artery. And failed.
Adulthood comes, I have NF1(since birth), I’m now diagnosed with depression and anxiety, on top of many other things…. and I want to just die. I’m unable to keep jobs because of my mental health and physical health. my “partner” and others say they understand my needs and struggles, but I have those problems used against me, so it makes me feel useless to everyone. I miss my life when I was between 21-24… I feel like a burden on people and those who’s job it is to get me help I need.  One of the VERY few people I actually made friends with who would always be there for me is no longer here because of a stupid drunk driver. I’m now 30 and feel as if life isn’t for me. I’m such a failure, and there is no need for me to be here. I get no enjoyment out of life like I used to. life was unfair to me, if I didn’t have my physical and mental problems my life would probably be better than it is now. It’s not fair I have the problems of living with a condition that has no cure. I can’t do talking therapy because I don’t physically like talking about my problems. I want all of it to end, it’ll be the best for me and other people so they don’t have to put up with me. I wish I had been successful at my attempt when I was younger, then I won’t be here…. miserable, and worthless. 
I do have a child that lives with “her”, I love him so much but don’t want to let him see how much of a failure I am."

190qwt7,Depression,2024-01-07,I can't go on,"I have depression. I've had it for 18 years. I've been on 5 different antidepressants at different times in my life and they work for a short while....until they don't. I have regular therapy.
I've tried the things.
But I'm tired.

I can't go to work some days, I can't even get out of bed sometimes. My appetite is gone now.
Sometimes I can't sleep, sometimes I sleep for days.

Lately it has all been so bad that all I think about is ending it all.
On new years eve, as the fireworks went off, I had a strong realisation that I wouldn't last until the end of the year.

It should have been a happy moment, I was with my best friends. But all I could think about was the end.

All I need is to find a way for someone to not find me, to take care of my dog and then I can escape this pain I'm feeling.
And it is pain..it's painful to live. Besides sadness I can't feel much of anything.

Like I said, I'm tired. I'm tired of trying things that don't work and I'm tired of talking about it.
I've tried to ""fake it until you make it"". But my mask is slipping.

I can't tell this to anyone else so I'm just saying it for the sake of it. Maybe someone out there can show me what to do to say goodbye."
190qvy9,Depression,2024-01-07,I’m getting depressed again,"I was doing really well for a while. I even went off my meds and was doing good, but for the past few months i’ve felt it slowly creeping in again. I live with my mom in my tiny home town with absolutely nothing to do. All of my friends have moved away and there isn’t any people here that I can be friends with. I dropped out of college last year because I was so depressed and failing all of my classes. I feel embarrassed and guilty for that and I don’t think I can even go back to school there because I don’t want to face my teachers. I have no idea what I want to do for a career and I feel like I don’t really have any exceptional skills to point me in a good direction. I’m currently a caregiver, but I work the night shift so I mainly just clean. Since i’m working nights the only people I see is my family and my coworkers. I know I need to see a therapist, but I really don’t want to have to go through all the work of finding one. Idk i guess the weight of loneliness and not knowing what i’m doing with my life is getting to me."

I tried. I really fuckin tried this time. She was, no, IS really pretty 😍 and beautiful. Very smart and driven. I can only imagine how sexy (respectfully). She could accomplish something, anything of value or creativity. Wtf am I gonna do? Prob hold her back in multiple, if not every way. Could be on the trajectory to president or some shit, and I'd fuck that up for her. I am not her compatible or equal, by no metric. I will never be worthy, I will never be enough. What usually happens is i get really close with a girl I like. I'm as respectful as possible while also maintaining the signal of ""I think your attractive and am romantically interested"". Then I might get lucky enough to reach the talking stage. Such excitement. Kinda like the calm before the storm. Then the ""your too young for me"", ""its not a good time"", or just being ghosted. OK now big sad. Then self hate, thinking about how I could have had something with her, if I was a better person. If I can I (from here on fuc it. Idc about spelling for a post that, tbh prob won't do anything at all. More waste of time. Also late and early are becoming one) save our messages. And pictures if any was sent. I end up jacking off to the idea of sex with them, yes, but also the simple idea of us, of someone of the female gender besides family and close friends finally caring.

Not this time tho, I realized that I'm just fuckin stupid. She said ""maybe in a yr or 2"". That sounds like a no, but hey it can be proven true. So if she did prove it by kissing me, how do I know that's not some sort of pitty?

Holding my hand (omfg I'd be so fuckin ecstatic idc idc idc it sounds gay or whatever, get bent. This means she doesn't mind being associated with me.) Sitting with me in view of others. Having no shame to initiate a kiss to me in front others. I just want to feel wanted and romantically loved.

I've literally thought about just the thought of kissing a person in a romantic way, and gotten almost fully hard. This, MY, existence is worthless and needs to end. Society failed me as a person, and if society can't fix me, society can't have me.

190o28p,Depression,2024-01-07,Looking for meaning,"I have been struggling a lot with feelings of adequacy in the society we live in. I deeply hate the route the economic system we live under has taken, and how maximizing profit above all else has become the norm. And what I hate even more I have come to realize is how hollow and lacking of motivation and dreams I am now. Sometimes I find myself reading stuff along the lines of  
  
\-What would you do if money was not a factor?  
  
Or  
  
\-picture your perfect life, doing what you love etc.  
  
And I have come to the very sad realization that I CAN NOT EVEN picture what a perfect or happy life is exactly to me. Or what I would be doing if money was not a thing. When I was younger I had a few dreams. I really wanted to see the snow, I really wanted a gaming pc, then I really wanted a car. But for a few years maybe I have not had a dream, I don't know what I could even look forward to. To me it seems my mind sometimes is only worried about finding a job I can tolerate because of how scared I am of job hopping for the rest of my life and becoming a burden for people because of my inability to function in capitalism. Sometimes I am overwhelmed by a feeling, by this need to create, to help, to do what I am good at and be a positive asset to the world. But I am broken, I am not particularly good at anything, I have no motivation and it hurts even more because even through all the self doubt and negativity I know deep inside I am special, and I have to potential to create something meaningful. I have had trauma, depression, anxiety and so much worrying throughout my life that I think my essence is so dim that it will be a lot of hard work to stop seeing the world through the lenses that have helped me survive so far. I used to dream of traveling and seeing the world, nowadays I rarely even think about that because I can't see a realistic scenario where I would be able to afford traveling, and that applies to so many things, I think so lowly of myself and what I can achieve that I have subconsciously programmed myself to not hope for anything good. I used to constantly day dream, now I am not even sure what makes my happy.  
  
I am agnostic but today when I go to sleep I am going to pray and ask from the universe that I can at least begin to see a goal, that I can start to picture what my ideal life is and what I actually love to do is. How am I supposed to dig myself out of this hole if it feels like there is nothing out here for me, at least nothing that I have any ability to reach or that I am deserving of.  
  
Maybe this is the wrong train of through, and I should take one day at time and slowly find happiness and the boundless wonder I had as a child. But I truly believe and I am hoping for something that can at least give me a heard start, a goal that I think I will be able to reach someday that can give me strength when things get tough."

190nql5,Depression,2024-01-07,Do people even care,"I've recently started self-harming after being clean for 1,5 years, and I've also come out to some of my friends about my struggles recently with food, self-harm, and my old suicide attempts that I've kept from everyone. All I wanted was a single sign that they cared about my well-being and that my life was worth living. However, when I told them about it, they made jokes and told me that its ""not a big deal"" or that eating disorders aren't that harmful. Some even just left me on read.

190nle3,Depression,2024-01-07,I’m much too sensitive and it’s ruining my life,"

Okay sorry for the formatting I’m on my phone and word vomiting a bit so if anything’s confusing, I apologise.

I’m much too sensitive for this world, I’m not claiming to be an “empath” or too nice or on a high horse about anything, because frankly it is unbearable
I have a pretty serious mental disorder and it contributes as I’m very emotionally sensitive, like I have emotional burns that feel like they are relit with each trigger.
I work at a pet shop and things like a missing pet poster set me off, or an elderly dog with a sad face. It’s that bad.

I love my partner but he is the opposite of sensitive and everything that hurts me turns to a fight, and then I get told I ruined the night. It’s often I’m too emotional or sensitive and even things we pre agree on to help kinda get lost in the storm. not really anyone to blame imo just aware I’m pretty awful to be around. And it’s making me slowly feel extremely insecure and unworthy to the point anything that is not perfect is a flaw that eats me up 
I don’t know how to actually live anymore, I can’t be myself, I can’t express myself without being told it’s too much,
I don’t have any freedom to be me,‘and when I do, it crushes me
I’m so sad all the time and I live solely off of hope, but there’s only so much hope to rely on.
It feel like I’m constantly on an uphill battle of fighting, any emotion I express is wrong or too much and it’s unbearable
I want to be different and strong I really really do
Idk if I’m venting or asking for advice but if you have any at this point I’m open to anything
I just need anything else than what I’ve got since it’s not working, I desperately , so so desperately want to be okay on a day to day thing and im willing to hear anything."

I have been diagnosed with severe depression and anxiety, started doing selfharm, had many suicidal thoughts. Attempted suicide 17 times and something saved me always: mom, rope, dull knife, even a shoelace. And now nothing is going to stop me. Mom is getting groceries and i made a strong noose, hung it up my ceiling and prepared my knife properly. After i am done writing this post i will hang myself up and keep stabbing and cutting until i die. I do not care about the pain, parents, all this shit.

190mwuc,Depression,2024-01-07,Help,"Hi. In the last few weeks, I have ruined multiple opportunities to have a good time. Just in general. My gf hung out with some friends, but out of my social anxiety, insecurities and intrusive thoughts, I chose to camp out in their lobby for 4 hours doing nothing rather than to join them. That’s just one rare example. More commonly, like literally today, my friends were online playing some games that I would usually join. But since I’m significantly worse than them, I always have a bad time playing one specific game. I played once, got off at 5 and have been in bed doing absolutely nothing since. It’s 11:30 now. If I could just be happy, or just not be sad and be neutral, I would have had a regular day and maybe even had some fun. But instead, I chose to go to bed and lay there for no reason other than that I just didn’t want to do anything. 

What the hell? Why am I not capable of having a normal day? Why am I incompetent in doing literally anything? What do I do when I don’t want to do anything?

For context I’m diagnosed with mid to severe depression, anxiety, I have social anxiety, and am on the autism spectrum."
190mwer,Depression,2024-01-07,I feel myself slipping,"I’ve suffered from depression and trauma my who life. I had constant ideations from about 8 to 23. At one point I was admitted to a mental hospital after a psychotic break from reality. After that I was in therapy and finally properly medicated and was starting to finally recover. Lately I’ve become disabled and it’s taken almost everything from me. I had to quit my job and my school won’t let me continue because it’s taking me too long to get my degree. I can’t do my hobbies or drive or often even bathe myself. I have nothing to look forward to in life. I had fantasies of starting a family but there’s no way I can do that in my current state. Last night I had an extremely graphic dream involving killing myself and I actually woke up feeling happy. When I was younger I used to daydream about things like this for hours, keeping a knife under my bed to hold and imagining what I could do with it. The rest of the day I kept thinking about that dream, and I had a yearning, almost nostalgic feeling about it. I wanted to skip taking my medication so bad, I wanted to feel like I used to. I still do, I’m in a constant battle inside my mind about taking my medication or not. I’m posting this here because I’m not able to tell anyone else and I just wanted to get this out of my mind even for just a little bit."

I’m done growing. This I’ve accepted but the idea that I can’t grow anymore has brought me to the conclusion of “why sleep or even try for that matter?” I won’t grow if I sleep and why should I workout anymore if I’m limited by my height. Rationally I understand this is stupid sleep isn’t just for growing and working out has many benefits being short is actually better cause less ROM. But even then I can’t stand the idea of being in my 20s and looking up at my sick dad. It’s fucked up that in my mind getting helped by someone shorter feels wrong and because of that I don’t want to help anyone anymore even though my whole life all I’ve ever tried doing is helping others and I’ve been pretty successful at that I’d like to think I’ve pulled a few people out of some tough spots and gotten people into some better habits. I have a couple things to be proud of but I can’t get over my height for the rest of my life I have to look up at people despite how strong I get I could’ve always been stronger if I was taller I’ll never achieve my dream physique simply because of my proportions, don’t get me wrong I’m not insecure about my muscles that’s all I actually have going for me but I just hate myself so much not exclusively because of my height I’m prideful, rude, I lash out too fast, and I’m constantly having these thoughts that are nothing like what I want to be whenever I see someone doing better than me I get mad even though I want to be happy for them whenever someone catches up to me I get insecure it’s like I can only be happy if I’m better and this is toxic as fuck I hate myself for this.

190modi,Depression,2024-01-07,Depression from limerence. how can i forget someone I really cared about?,"Before I start to talk about my story, I would like to say thank all of the people who reads this, and If you leave any comment, I will really appreciate it. Please understand that English is not my mothertongue.

I(27M) moved to a new country for my study 4 years ago. and I still have a couple of years more left till my graduation. I met this girl(24F) 2 years ago from the internet. She was also studying another major in the same university. she was extremely friendly and kind and caring person while I am shy and insecure person. and our friendship has developed really fast.

We have tons of inside jokes, and tease each other. We smile at each other all the time. We share everything with one another. I know things about him that he would never tell anyone else, and I have told him all mine. We talk every day. whenever I was invited to her home and slept over there, we had great time. We always joked about how we should just get married but that was about it. we all felt that we are so lucky to have met each other in life. I started to have some imagination about our future together and it seemed happy.

in the beginning of friendship, it seemed she wants something more than friendship.and I wasn't confident and very insecure. I had tons of life pressure about success in life and guilty of getting economical support from my parents, etc. and I was always afraid of starting the deeper relationship with someone i really like cuz people say every relationship ends at the end. I wasn't sure if i am gonna stay in her country after the graduation. and If i decide to leave, it means our relationship will end.

people say I think too much. I know right. I do.

And I felt safe when i stay as this intimate best friend. I will be able to develop into relationship when i am ready, otherwise I will still have someone I would love to meet in this country eventhough i leave the country. so I refused her a couple of times. I explained about my insecurity and excuses to her. but she was just an angel. she understands me. eventhough I am not ready, she stayed next to me. supported me as usual, and cared about me everyday.

I even said 'I feel sorry and worried if you've been wasting your precious 20s while you are stuck with this loser me. I hope you might meet some guy and enjoy your life a bit..' ..but I am not sure If i really mean this. I was sorry for staying in the friendzone but might not want her to leave me. very selfish.

I wasn't sure if she decided to give up her feeling on me and to stay as friend. or if she keeps waiting for me to change my mind. anyway. she was an anchor of my life alone in the new country. and she was as caring person as before to me. she said she needs me in her life anyway. and we had beautiful time together for 2 years.

and A month ago, we decided to hang out like other normal days. and while we were hanging out and having fun, she revealed that she was seeing someone. a guy from her class. she told me that they started to talk 3 months ago as friend and talk everyday just like she and I did 2 years ago. and they discovered they have some feelings on each other and developed into relationship. they were doing long distance relationship so they met only 3 times in real, but I got to know that they even had sex a few times already.

I didn't know how to react. I kinda expected that this consequence will happen one day but when i confronted it, it was more painful and more bitter than i thought. I have been under pressure about my career and study. I had my own goal in my life. and I felt I am not capable of fulfiling my goal when I have a date. I sent her back to her home by train and went back home alone with very complicated feelings. and after a while. I felt heartbreak and huge emptiness in my mind. my mind was captured by the image of her and her new bf smiling at each other. this heartbreak that I have never experienced in my life was too painful.

and these are the list of how I'd acted since then

1. I visited her town and told her that I don't wanna be friends with her anymore. and I gave back everything that has our memories to her. I found her crying and not understanding why i am doing this.
2. my mind didn't get any better. I finished bottles of wine and called her and vent my feeling honestly. very honestly. all the feeling of jealousy, inferiority, pain and disgust about their   
relationship.
3. I visited her town impulsively again. I told her that I will leave the country for a while for self healing, it's painful to stay with someone that I wanted to be with forever. and that I discovered that I've cared about her more than friends eventhough she might think the same as I do about her. finally told her that I wish I wanna meet someone like her again before it's too late and don't make the same mistake I made in previous relationship with her.

the train is gone already. she didn't know what to do but cry in front of me. She didn't want me to leave her. she believed if I get over with this then I can return to her. eventhough we were not in romantic relationship, she told me that it hurts like breakup, and she kept saying that her answer is same that she will be here for me.

which drives me crazy and confuses me and makes me fall into Limerence.

I was busy studying and running toward my goal for my whole life. and I couldn't see what i was missing in my life. I want to take this happening for granted and move on because this is my fault and the consequence that I have to accept. so eventhough it's bitter, I should going forwardly for better future of mine as I always did with other losses in my life.

but this time is different. my life has STOPPED since the day i heard her new relatnioship story. and I am pissed.

Now my mind is obsessed with her. I interpret her last messages to find any hope to return to the moment when we both were happy, check our last messages everyday, now I found myself trying to do stalking her on social media(I unfollow every sns accounts of hers), Wish her send me any message eventhough i told her not to bother me while i am away, tightening feeling in my chest, I just can't wish good luck on their new start at all. I totally lost myself now. I always feel disgusted and jealous.

How can I just forget about everything about someone like her so easily? there are so many fishes out there? I know but I don't feel like i will be able to find someone like her. and she was the only one with whom I made very deep connection and opened up my heart

did her tears mean she regret? why can't she accept the farewell and still try to care about me? then why didn't she even ask my opinion before she started to meet that guy? doesn't it mean that she wasn't caring about my opinion on her new start. will she return to me if they break up one day? and do i think i can wait till then? and be cool enough to accept her after all this pain from my insecurity?

false hopes.

I am afraid if i will keep myself sane and get over with this and move on well without her care.

but I am afraid of her care. I doubt if she doesn't want to leave me only because she pities on me.

I just wanna have one last conversation with her and ask about very crucial questions. whether she has had any feeling on me and whether she wants me to stay for just friendship or something more. I want her to give clarity so that i can decide to move on or not as soon as possible. do you think it's a good idea?...

I appreciate you all who has read all and reached here. and I will be happy if you can give any advice or wisdom on my immature matter. I am just a loser with low self esteem with lack of experience. I always moved forward only. I should've turned my head left and right and looked after myself more. I watched most of limerence videos on youtube and trying to believe my feeling isn't love anymore. but I still believe we are reciprocal to each other which actually makes me hard to stop being limerent here.

I have very deep heartbreak. and now I understand how painful you would feel with limerence.

I wish you all the best in your life. thanks for reading my long thread."

190mevh,Depression,2024-01-07,The feeling of emptiness,"For me, the feeling of emptiness is a cruel mixture of worthlessness and despair. The desperation for life to change, for the one person that cared for me to come back, for my addictions to stop, for sleep to be easy, and for my pain to stop. The worthlessness I feel day to day is vast and overwhelming. I feel like every bad aspect of my life, is all my fault. I feel that I’m the reason my gf was sent to a boarding school in Tallahassee, I believe that it is my fault my parents argue and yell. I think that all my friends just tolerate me, and that they don’t really want me around. I feel that my life is in a rapidly deteriorating state. Each day, more and more go wrong. Every time my eyes open, I wish they hadn’t. Every day, I feel isolated and hated by the world. I believe that no one would go looking for me if I just disappeared. The only thing that keeps me from the edge is the slight hope that my gf is waiting for me, that she still loves me, even though we can’t communicate. No texts, no calls, no letters, and no visits. All of my family tell me that I’m wasting time on her, that I should just move on, but I can’t. I promised that I’d wait, that I would hurt myself, and that I loved her. She was sent off in August of 2023, she returns in August of 2024. But by then, I’ll be living in Florida, and she’ll be in Georgia. I feel like I’m nothing without her. She made me feel more human, alive, calm, complete, and happy. I miss her everyday, I can’t get her out my head. I don’t know how much longer I have in me. I don’t know what I’ll do when I run out of willpower and hope. Every time she’s back in town, either for a holiday or just break from school, I’m out of town. Her parents won’t let me communicate with her, she her or anything. I fucking hate being alive, I want my pain to end, I don’t want to feel empty anymore."
190m89n,Depression,2024-01-07,"Pls help, anything.","I'm a 22M retired service member.

My childhood has been nothing but abuse. Verbal. Physical. Mental. You name it. I have never been validated, nor have been told that I am a great son. Never received emotional comfort or physical comfort.  My traumas since childhood go so in depth that it would be a whole word document essay.

I ran away from home at 17, I stayed homeless for 7 months before joining the military. I was most happy then. Had to deal with a friend who past away due to sU1c\*de, it hurt. I couldnt stay....I joined the military, with the mindset of staying in until I can retire.

Caught a disease that was trying to kill me during my service (graves disease). It was the worst. Panic attacks. Passing out. Couldnt sleep. Depression. Mixed emotions. I didnt know what it was at first. I thought it was just my lack of discipline, as my fellow soldiers put me out to be. But this disease destroyed my day to day function

Got surgery to solve the issue. Life made  180 degree turn. But with the surgery my hormones have made a drastic change. depressive mood swings left and right. taking pills for the rest of my life despite living a healthy lifestyle prior to the surgery. It hurt. My day to day function depends on a pill. forever.

Turns out I cant serve in the condition I was in post surgery. I medically retire. My family from the childhood I mentioned earlier promised me a home to come to, so I took the offer. But things went back to they were. Abuse. People tell me ""why didnt you just fight back?"". I was so accustomed to it my whole childhood it makes me shut down. I shake, uncontrollably. cant form sentences when pressured into those situations.

I leave and go to my other side of the family because I cant take it anymore. I love and care for them but I feel so disassociated from them. It hurts to see how close they are and how much the love eachother but I'm somewhat of a black sheep. I'm living day to day now feeling shitty due to the condition I'm in. And I have a wall put up. to everyone. sometimes to my significant other. 

Even then I push my partner away because I feel like they'll betray me. I'm so alone. I dont know what to do. 

I need help. 

anything helps.

190lrpq,Depression,2024-01-07,"I physically can't take my medication, why?","As the title says, I'm not able to take my antidepressants and I don't know why. It's been almost a week. 

So I was about to take them but my Hands started shaking and the pills suddenly smelled REALLY bad. Like rotten eggs or mold, it was so bad that I gagged and decided to just skip the day. 
I'm aware I should take them, but couldn't. The next few days, it was the same. Does anyone else had this or knows why this is happening? 

Additional Information: Psychiatrist changed my medication in late October/early November from 50mg Fluoxetin to 10mg Paroxetin. Took me about 5 weeks to fade out the Fluoxetin and started Paroxetin in early December. Getting off antidepressants was really hard after 3 weeks and I fell into a depressive episode, because of that and a break up. Hasn't gotten better when I started the new meds. Around the Holidays things got worse, I got Covid with fever and everything, couldn't eat and that also hasn't gotten better. 
The last few days I had crazy headaches, dizziness and vomited a couple of times. Also sometimes I can't sleep at all or I sleep like 14 hours straight.
I haven't took my medication for three days at that time, but I was able to take painkillers without any problems. So it was not the fact it was pills. 
My next appointment is on the 19th this Month, I'll also ask my Psychiatrist if she knows why.



TLDR; Can't take Antidepressants physically, but can take painkillers w/o problems. Why?"

190kuo3,Depression,2024-01-07,Depression is kicking my ass,I’ve been going through a lot of abuse with my mom and “partner”. My best friend killed herself this year and it’s been harder on me than I thought. I’m going through a lot and spiraling. Drinking everyday. I don’t know how to stop. As days goes on I find less to live for. I’m starting to turn into a person  hate. I feel disgusted with myself
190ksap,Depression,2024-01-07,I really need a kind soul.,"24m. I attempted suicide a few weeks ago, and I have a plan for it again. I lost everything. Both my furbabies of 4 years, I lost my job working with special needs patients which was the most rewarding work ive ever done. I lost the two people who were the closest and only people I had for two years, simply because of the pain I go through, and because i attempted suicide. All in the same week. I went into a suicide attempt thinking I'd lose it all, just to come out of it realizing I truly did lose everything.
This has happened so many times, and i've been nothing but vulnerable, respectful, and supportive to them, to everyone. That's why it hurts so much. If If was just selfish, unwilling to be cecpiteble to change, I wouldn't of been the one abandoned, or hurt. Unfortunately I couldn't even do it if I tried. 

I've tried to be a loving person, but I have nobody left to care about. Its left me so broken. All ove wanted out of life, is to love, and be loved. Maybe thats my biggest problem. I dont see people for what they are or their past, I see pepople for what they can grow into. So i miss all of the red flags. 

Im taking one last shot in the dark before i make another attempt on my life."

It’s not like I don’t want to live but it seems too trivial and I don’t know. I don’t have much expectations from life and little things give me lots of joy but at times, I cannot feel joy even when everything is alright. The depression has sucked out the joy from me. My counsellor was glad when I said something that cheered me up, she talked about it as a ray of light and there is some hope. I really want to latch onto the ray of light. I know my disappearance is going to bother so many people around me, but the whole existence has been bothering me and is weighing too heavily on me. I hope I survive but then I don’t want to either. I feel lucky to have people around me who have been supportive no matter what I do. I am listening to ‘On The Nature of Daylight’ while writing this. I miss myself. I miss the joyous me who wanted to explore, make mistakes, and live life. Now, I am planning to quit in a month. The duality of wanting to live in itself is very excruciating. I am crying while typing this."

Like why can’t I be pretty or skinny or healthy, I’m so unhealthy I can’t get pregnant and I don’t wanna have sex either. Im ugly inside and out my body is disgusting but im so self hating that I don’t want to fix it. I want to keep saying  to others that im okay but im really not. I keep thinking about death and it scares me, I know i won’t off myself but if I were to die tomorrow would it really even make a difference. I’m nothing, I have no children no one really needs me. I want a baby so bad that I just am done with everything. I’m numb but I’m hungry my belly grumbles even when I’ve already eaten my heart burns even tho I’m cold. I’ve had issues sleeping lately because I’d be okay if I didn’t wake up. Is that bad to say? I just want the pain inside to go away, I know how to make it stop but I know I shouldn’t resort to that. I hurt so bad inside that I can’t even cry any more, I’m already dead inside. I haven’t no idea what to do with myself anymore I just want to sleep but I truly can’t. I normally don’t like to put this stuff out there but I can’t bring myself to tell my family"

I’m a loss cause. One day maybe amongst my 20s, I will give up my ego, my day dreams , hope, and just leave. I hold on to hope so bad but It lessens every year as I age. If my projections are right my 20s will be it. I can’t fix myself. An eleven year old shouldn’t have suicidal thoughts you know? I seriously can’t do it. Edit: Started at 11 having thoughts. Now 20.

I just wonder who that little girl would’ve been. I know she would’ve been awesome and killing this chance at life. I was just such a young soul who is still in me somewhere but I can’t bring it back - because I barely knew her lol.. I was barely conscious. I was just out of diapers.

I'm so fucking scared because I know if I don't do anything I'll end up being a failure but then I remember even if I do something I won't be happy, I'll still be in this disgusting body and the only solution for that is killing myself, what's the point.

190jj8p,Depression,2024-01-07,I think about hurting others,So to give some background I'm (17M) and  have been dealing with depression since around early middle school to my curriculum last year of highschool. I don't know why but my brain keeps pushing me to want to hurt people. I don't know if it's because I'm isolated or some other reasons. I always thought about my family disowning me so if I were to die or commit suicide then it wouldn't hurt so much (it would probably hurt a lot physically). I don't know why but it feels like everyday the urge to hurt others grows for some reason and I don't know why. Any advice or possible explanation?
190jj8b,Depression,2024-01-07,Trying to reconnect to my surroundings after years of dissociation,"TLDR; I do not know how to connect with the world around me because I’ve been autopilot/survival mode throughout my formative years and never learned those skills

I’m at a point in my life where my mental health is finally on a good path of recovery (still a lot of work to be done), and I’m realizing just how disconnected I am to the world around me.

At this point I’ve been depressed for over a decade, and it feels like I have been on autopilot for the entire time. I would go to school or work, focus all my energy on doing well there because I don’t want people to sense something’s wrong, then go home and crash. I used to follow the news until 2016, after which it just got more depressing and I didn’t need another thing making me feel like shit about the world.

I started therapy 3 years ago and it has done wonders for my mental health (I have PCOS, hypomania, depression and anxiety). I’m slowly working my way out of the autopilot mode and brain fog, and am realizing that I really don’t know how to connect with the world around me.

People around me just seem to know everything about the city we live in and major events in the world. Overall very well-informed and more grounded in reality? I’m not sure if I’m explaining this well. I tried to follow some local news stations as a first step and got super overwhelmed. 

If anyone has experienced something similar, I’d appreciate hearing about how you addressed this, or some advice!"
190jh8a,Depression,2024-01-07,Why tf am I still here?,"I am just so fcking done with life and this endless darkness I have to deal with every single day. Every single day ends with me crying myself to sleep and wanting to die. When I go it’ll be for the best because I’ll finally be at peace and plus I’m not going anywhere in life anyways. I hate myself so much. I’m a fat, selfish, miserable bitch who does nothing but hurt people. I have no friends except for two I’ve never met who live on the other side of the world that probably wouldn’t even notice if I was gone. I’m barely on track to graduate high school a year late when my friends and my younger brother can do it on time with 90s and get into university. I’m 18 F and I have never had a job and I have no desire to get one even though I’m moving out for the first time in March into a brand new apartment I only have because of help from this disability program when again my friends and my brother have jobs and will probably be able to move out with no help. I’m losing interest in everything I love especially my favorite thing women’s soccer and I also have no desire to eat anything. If I were to continue living, my life would consist of me being unemployed with a shitty education, living off disability checks, taking meds that don’t help and make me feel like shit, dying slowly from starving myself, thinking about killing myself all day long, staying in bed doing nothing and crying non stop. In my eyes that’s not a life worth fighting for."

190jb3i,Depression,2024-01-07,What makes a happy person?,"I've been dealing with depression through medication for a couple of months now, and I'm struggling to understand what happiness or satisfaction is supposed to feel like. I have no clue what ""normal"" life is supposed to feel like, but I'm so unsatisfied.

I find it challenging to feel satisfied with what I have, and it throws me into a loop of feeling like I don't have enough or am not enough. Despite having a couple of friends, I often find myself feeling entirely alone. I frequently compare myself to people I follow online who post with their big friend groups, and I wonder why I haven't been able to fit into a group like that.

Currently in my second year of college, I feel like only now have I found my footing in my classes, having had to drop some courses during my second semester of freshman year.My question is, what am I striving to achieve? I don't know what I'm supposed to be working towards, given that I feel the need to ask for help here. I've always felt like I'm not doing enough or don't have enough, and I don't know what to do. With the new year and new semester, I'm thinking about what my goals should be. Should I try to make more friends to stop feeling lonely, or should I work on fixing my insecurities that may be the reason I feel that way in the first place? I feel like no matter what I am doing I never feel satisfied with what my life is and I don't think I ever will which is a very scary thought to have.

A big part of it as well is my relationship with romance. For the longest time I've been a serial dater since that was something that distracted me from my own life. I felt like if I dated someone cool who knows who they are, it would apply to me to. This mindset has been a slippery slope of toxic relationships and obession. I don't want to have to use someone else to be satisfied with my own life."
190jb1e,Depression,2024-01-07,im so very tired of all,"So, i just wanted to make this post to let off some of the stress i have since i have to work all night,   
as the title says im very tired of my life, i wouldn't say i want it to end right now but it's just a hell live the day to day, since my mother died last year all the stress i had multiplicated by 5 times since i started to have more responsabilities like helping with the house budget and working while studying at 18, the situations of the day to day in my job, the awful working hours that consume my whole day, unfair situations with my boss, the absence of love and vents on my day to day, it all makes me feel tired an sad the whole day, i wouldn't say all this stress started right now, it is so very long like 5 years, but lastly it is stronger and now it's not only affecting me in a psychological way but also in a physically way, due to stress i have lots of white hairs, awful skin, im tired all day and it gets worst, i barely have friends that don't even talk to me that much and when they do, they don't even ask how i feel or how's my life going, im just done with this all and i feel the only thing that really motivates me to keep going are my dogs, anyways, next week i'll start therapy and that with the gym that i go since a year or so i really hope this all fixes, i'll have to make so much changes like searching a better job, being constant with therapy and gym and take more care about myself overall but the whole situation and the completely absence of care bout others just makes this harder and like a hell, i just really hope to things get better, of couse they won't get better by themselves but i just hope with all the effort i make and i will make things get better because im so tired of this, i hate how i ended up looking by the whole situation  
anyways if you reade this thank you so much, i just really needed to take some things out cause im having way too much since years. have a nice day "
190j6ma,Depression,2024-01-07,Weight lifting has both helped and completely ruined me,"I’ve been lifting for over a year now and I just can’t help but feel like I have nothing to show for it. My physique is small, more fat than muscle, and in general just looks like dog shit. Virtually none of my muscles are good looking or developed and I’m surprised I haven’t been laughed out of the gym at this point. My lifts are pathetic and would raise even the weakest man’s ego. The only good thing I could say is I look a little better and have lost weight but in general, I just look pathetic. I can’t stop thinking about how much better everyone else there looks, it’s literally the only thing on my mind, even outside the gym. Yesterday I came close to just fucking pulling the trigger on myself because I hated my body and strength that bad. It seems like it’s genuinely ruined my life in many ways and I’m stuck in an even deeper hole than before. Everyday I contemplate just fucking blowing my brains out. I’m literally 24/7 obsessed with this which is probably not healthy but idk how the hell to stop it. Now I will say one thing, it’s definitely better to work out while you’re depressed instead of doing nothing and in no way am I suggesting you shouldn’t do it. The problem is that for me, it’s made my life worse in many aspects and I just don’t know why I can’t have a normal person’s reaction to working out (that being feeling way better after)"

I'm not afraid that I would be a burden for the casket... I gave my parents money from my scholarship... I think that can cover a land and a casket... or cremate me and throw me on the sea... or they can just left me to rot somewhere...

190is7q,Depression,2024-01-07,too self aware for my own good?,"**TLDR: i know exactly what’s wrong with me, and yet i can’t seem to put it into practice and use it to get better.**

i have been dealing with depression for many years now, and have been through extensive therapy. i’ve always been described as self aware, as i know myself to be. i’ve found that therapy (at least the kind i’ve been getting) has nothing left to offer me. i am very aware of what is wrong with me, and why.

before i started struggling with depression i was actually very interested in the condition, as a subject. i was very familiar with what depression would look like, how it would make one think and feel etc.

then i got it, and i recognized all those things in myself. still when i get extra suicidal i know i’m being irrational, and so i never actually hurt myself. when i feel hopeless, certain that there is nothing and no one for me in the whole world, i am simultaneously clicking my tongue at how this is just the depression making me feel and think a certain way. how this is not ME but my CONDITION thinking these thoughts, feeling these feelings.

still i am doing terribly. i am practically one with my bed. i maintain no hygiene unless i’m leaving the house, which will be a few times a month, if that. i get up only to eat and piss, laying down the rest of the time.

my reason for posting this is one, to see if others are having the same frustrating experience. and two, because i desperately want someone to give me a magical solution to this. like some exotic new kind of therapy that works soooo well for people too self aware for their own good."

190ilz4,Depression,2024-01-07,I am not sure if anything anymore.,"I have seen 3 psythriatricst so far, working with the third in weekly session. While I am not officially diagnosed, I have had severe mood swings for 15+ years now. (I am 30). Sure there are a lot of stories in my past, tragics even but my biggest problem is not being able to let go. I have specific memories from years and years ago that I cant shake off. They come bacj constantly and vividly. These are most of the times situations where I was hurt in a way. Non of them were physiccal. I also struggle with alcohol abuse. Its erratic, 3-4 beers a night, or 2 bottles of wines and 10 beers. These are usually triggered by something. I have wonderful friends that I can always count on with anything but lately I have been starting to lose my grip. I skip events, barely talk to them. Not because I don't want to, I am just ashamed, or tired.These people have been listening to my problems since university, and I don't feel like bourdening them. There are things I am too ashamed to share with them.
 I have been taking persc meds for a bit more than 2 months. Scippa and Frontin. At the start everything felt amazing, different but I started to lack motiovation to do simple tasks. Now Im at the point where those single days that I spent feeling down are much more intense. All I do is cry and sleep. Unfortunately these are lasting days now previous to single incidents. I have bumped up my next visit to my psychiater as I completely started to lose it and I fear for my work and relationship. I truly don't know what I am supposed to do. I was always afraid of medicine, even when I knew I needed it, but now its just making it worse. I don't want to hurt anyone but being so miserable will most likely result in it. The only bright side is that I love my mom so much that I would never attemot suicide to hurt hur."
190iftu,Depression,2024-01-07,Venting.,"hey… everyone. Honestly just remembered Reddit exists so I just took an opportunity to vent. It’s a lot so be ready. 2023 was honestly the hardest year for me to not.. end it all. If I didn’t give a crap what my friends and family would endure then I’d have been long gone a good while ago. I’ll go by 2023 with the months, 
January: came out as bisexual (pretty good month and happiest I’d been since I was a kid)
 February: still pretty happy
March: sharp random yearly spike of depression/anxiety because I had felt like my crush was catching on that I liked him (he was a long time friend and I was scared I’d lose him)
April: hardest month. My mom said I was gonna burn in hell and dad told me to my face I don’t know what I am and gaslighted me into thinking I had put my crush in an uncomfortable place (I had told my crush the week prior the truth) 
May:heavily depressed and suicidal due to April’s events+school
June: has the best vacation+was happy again
July: ok month, back to standard sadness
August: school started, relatively normal
September: took girl to homecoming and talked daily (still somewhat sad)
October: hung out once more with girl first week of August. (Still talked). Dog passed away
November: she ghosted me and I also found out that she had talked about me behind my back, called me names, and lied to my face. Depression skyrockets again, felt empty and alone inside.
December: empty, alone, didn’t feel like Christmas, my own pet lizard got sick and died the day after Christmas after suffering for days.  
end of 2023

Fast forward to now. I just feel empty and sad again. I Don’t really have any feelings or emotion other than sadness. Just, bland and trying to push forward. I don’t know what to do anymore I just feel miserable and hurt. No one gets what I’ve gone through in life (this isn’t even close to my life) and no one will understand what it’s like to be me. I don’t intend on ending it but if I didn’t have any acknowledgment for my friends and family after I would be gone I would have been gone a long time ago. Last year was the hardest year ever and I honestly barely made it. My life has been filled with trauma and stress and all sorts of shit so that don’t help much. I just figured I’d post here because I knew people would listen."

But strangely, I don't feel a thing. It's like my emotions shut down, leaving me in this emptiness I can't shake off.
I wish I could say I care, but it's like the light in me has dimmed. 
There's no spark, no interest in anything. I'm stuck in this small village with no one around to share these feelings with, and it's tough.I'm reaching out here, hoping for some human connection, some understanding. Has anyone else felt this emptiness? How did you find your way back?

I didn't think about anything or anyone that was worth living for, however I'm still here, I don't know why, I don't know why I keep trying, you know, to fight against my depression, they always told me that I had the potential for many things, a good personality. To be frank, none of that matters, nor did it really matter, because it wasn't what I wanted, the only thing I wanted and couldn't was to get out of damn school. I just wish I could go to sleep, close my eyes, and never wake up again, but that sounds too good to be true. Sorry, I just wanted to write how I feel."

I just have to feel bad and be miserable because I can't tell myself ""well look, if it gets to be too much, you can kill yourself and it'll be over."" And have comfort in that. 


I can't find comfort because I know I'm stuck here feeling this way. It's horrible. It's such a scary a feeling almost like I'm feeling claustrophobic because I'm stuck somewhere and there's no way out and it's small and scary.

Everything went smoothly. They have a costume theme and I get the 3rd place. I roll a gashapon abd get the toy I wanted.

Everything went down hill at the end of party. I don't drive so I rely on my co worker car so it's hard for me to go home without them. They start to ask me if I drink alcohol or smoke or sex a women. I reply I don't do none of those, and they ask how old I am. I said 26. They said I'm not a man then they start forcing me to drink. I refuse. My co worker that drive me to party drag the time for me to stay at party longer.  I feel uncomfortable by everything so I call my sister to pick me up. I cried in the car feeling worst for all of them judging me.

This is what I get for try to get socialize. I was right going to any party is the worst idea and it will NEVER  end well. I will nerver go to any party again.

I don't want to go work tomorrow. I don't feel the same anymore and this is opportunity for me to kill myself. I feeling worst enough to do so and have all motivate. If I die everyone will know what drive me to do that. It must be today if I missed it I might lost this chance. Human society is not for me. I don't ment to be in this world. I should never have exist in this world.

190h088,Depression,2024-01-07,Not even addiction can win,"I (24m) been alone all my life. Never been in a healthy non-toxic relationship, the only sexual interaction I had were bjs I gave to friends because I was desperate and a r**e attempt on me. I'm a touch starved failure. I keep looking for ways to have any sexual satisfaction or intimate interactions.

I send nudes either somewhere public or to people I just met or friends, I actively look for people to sext with and exchange pics despite hating my own body, I consume a lot of porn and I find myself often not being excited enough by basic vanilla porn, I play porn games, I developed way too many kinks which include masochism and cnc, I constantly look for unfiltered AIs that I could chat with that are able to tend to my sexual needs. Most of these things I do out of boredom, to feel validated or to have any excitement in my life.

Yet depression is winning because I feel too insecure and hate myself too much to think that I look good on any pictures, I am too much of a loser to find someone, even a fwb or a one night stand, porn bores me. I wouldn't go to sleep before masturbating and recently I just go to bed and can't be bothered. It's like my extreme sex drive and desperation is there but I'm also unable to feel anything.

190gpgd,Depression,2024-01-07,I'm tired and I can feel myself giving up,"I (26F) feel like I've been slowly getting depressed for the last 5 years, with this last year being the worst. This will be a long post, I just need to say what I'm thinking and how I got to this point in life. Please forgive me for any mistakes, English is my 2nd language.

After I finished my bachelor's in 2018, I realized that I didn't have an idea of what I wanted to do with my life. Because of this, I decided to continuing studying and do a master's in the same broad subject,  biology, at the same university as my bachelor's. And I believe this is when my depression and lack of motivation started. I skipped so many classes, it got to the point that people that I did my bachelor's with and that were doing the same master's as I, didn't even know that I was doing a another degree with them. At the time, I thought I was just lazy because I couldn't be bothered to  show up to class. 

On my 2nd year of my master's, I was able to get an internship that actually gave some hope and ideas for my future. However, Covid came and my internship got cancelled immediately, after only 5 months (it was supposed to be a full year so I could do my thesis about it). My depression started to show some signs again due to the stress of losing a really interesting internship and being confronted with the fact that I had to start all over again with my thesis, which made me not do any work on it for several months. 

Fortunately, the university didn't gave up on me, and got me a new supervisor, that in turn gave me a new topic to research and to do my thesis on, and in 2021 I was able to finish my master's degree with a good overall grade.

I was able to get a job really quickly as a zookeeper at the city's zoo, where I worked for 2 years. I really enjoyed the animals and coworkers that I got to meet during that time. It definitely wasn't an easy job, and it had its ups and downs as any job does, but I really enjoyed it, even if I came to the conclusion very early on that I was over qualified to do it due to my studies, something that my parents kept telling me. 

However, in May 2023 after some problems I made the decision to quit my zookeeper job, and to look for better opportunities elsewhere (I was getting paid minimum wage and the prospects of that changing was nonexistent).

I knew getting another zookeeper job wasn't going to be easy, even if I am open to emigrate to another country or continent. I know 2 years of experience isn't much, but I thought it would count for something, apparently not, since I only got a handful of places asking me to interview with them, reaching the last stages of employee selection, of the hundred or so applications that I've sent.

I'm always getting rejected for 3 reasons, I need a work visa, I don't speak their language, and I don't have enough experience, even for junior positions.

I've tried focusing on other things while I'm unemployed, like going to the gym (lost the motivation after 2 days), dating (I lose interest in a matter of days or weeks, plus I don't have a lot of money available to go out a lot), reconnect with my hobbies such as anime and reading (I binged watch an anime or read a book series in a  week but didn't do it again for weeks /months).

I'm tired of living like this, getting job rejected on an almost weekly basis, unmotivated to do much of anything, unwilling to leave the house unless extremely necessary, staring blankly at the tv or phone because nothing captivates me.

Maybe I'm just lazy and feeling sorry for myself. Maybe I'm depressed and reaching the point of suicidal. I don't know. I'm tired..."

Work is hard. I feel so behind and in way over my head.

Kids have so many activities during the week, it's exhausting. 

The house is cluttered, laundry is behind, counters in a perpetual state of sticky. 

I've gained weight. No mental energy to stick to an exercise or diet.

I recently gave up masturbating as a replacement coping mechanism for self harm, cause I just don't want to do it anymore for so many reasons I don't have enough time to get into it. The lack of being able to get some kind of dopamine fix every day has me kinda fucked up. I haven't gotten out of bed in a few days, and I think I set a new record for most amount of hours consecutively slept. Since I stopped I can't stop cutting. The only reason I was able to stay clean for weeks or months on end was because of the admittedly excessive wanking. Now I can't stay even a few days clean, the only reason I'm not cutting all day everyday is because I'm to fucking tired. I'm to fucking tired to move, and all I can think about is cutting myself. I swore to myself I'd never drink or do drugs to forget but i really just want to get shit faced and blow my brains out. On top of all of that I've been super dysphoric lately (trans ftm) and I feel like life won't be worth living regardless of how great it might get. I genuinely want to gag every time I look at myself. I haven't been able to shower because I know if I end up alone in there I'll just cut more, and it's just hard to look at myself. I've only been able to shower with clothes on. I really just want to kill myself, but I know if I killed myself my mother would never forgive herself, and most likely check out early once my siblings don't need her anymore.

Yet the entirety of today I spent laying in bed, the blankets thrown over me, scrolling through content while I think about how tempting it would be to just end it all. All I need to do is one little philosophy essay that I could easily complete and that I was so excited to write yesterday yet I have just dissolved into a numb amorphous bedrotting mess. 

Might be due to undiagnosed ADHD, I'm not sure, but it seems likely. My primary care physician, counselor, and professors have recommended that I take testing but my insurance doesn't cover it and my parents were quite unhappy when they read the report sent to them in the mail by our medical insurance stating that I had gone to talk to them about ADHD and mental issues. 

How am I supposed to make it of this. I had such a good week and then it all came crumbling down as I approached this essay deadline and found myself sitting at my desk for five hours, unable to write for more than five minutes before going to the other room, turning my phone on, and scrolling. 

I'm trying but I keep fucking failing and it's so exhausting. And knowing that there is a solution out there that remains inaccessible to me because my parents don't believe mental health exists is exhausting.

190fu3f,Depression,2024-01-07,Why bother?,"Honestly, I'm not even really sure why I'm writing here. I don't think it will change anything, but I'm going to go for it anyway. I'm 28 (29 this year, maybe) and I feel like there's no point in my existence. Every step has just been failure after failure. I worked hard to get through college, even went on to get a master's, but I screwed up along the way, and now look at me. Master's degree with nowhere to use it, no practical skills, can't find another job, current boss is abusive, and I already suffered another abusive boss for two years before this. It always felt like every time I tried to look forward to something, anything, everything would go awry. 

It feels like I can't have just one good day. One day where I don't feel like an absolutely piece of trash who would be better off non-existent. I know it's selfish because I feel like attempts are made by those around me to help me, but it's also hard to hear people tell you that you're wrong about how you feel. I don't understand why no one can just listen instead of arguing with me about all the ways I'm wrong about myself. I've known me for 28 years, every though and every emotion. Even the ones that might not have names. 

Yet, I feel extremely alone. I used to look forward to marriage, kids, a house, a future. Now I dread it. I dread the thought of living, of having to continue another day. I want to disappear as painlessly as possible and stop burdening the people around me. 

Everything I've worked so hard for - everything I try to achieve just turns out for the worst. And I get worse, too. I feel distant and bitter, and I don't like who I am. I'd like to be better, but I also don't see the point. I don't feel like I can ever actually be happy, despite taking medication and making the effort to at least go to work every day. 

I wouldn't want to abandon my SO, but I think they'd be better off. Family, too. At the end of the day, the picture looks much better without me in it. I almost feel like I barely exist already. 

You know what I mean?"

190fo0z,Depression,2024-01-07,"My mom said that getting a boyfriend would ""cure"" me.","I have had depression for pretty much half my life. I started going on meds recently and am still waiting for them to start taking effect (I need to take them for at least 15 days before noticing any changes).

My mom is Bipolar and her treatment of me since I was young was one of the main factors that lead me into therapy. My low self-steam, dark outlook on life and overall anxiety can all be attributed to the ways I developed to cope with all the stress I was put through during my formative years.

Now, I Iove my mom. Yet I feel a lot of resentment and anger towards her, I love her as my egg donor and not as a person. One of the main reasons for that is that she outright refuses to acknowledge that her parenting may have caused some of my problems and despite going through depressive episodes in her own life she is not empathetic towards me at all.

When I tried to open up to her today about the way I was feeling regarding some aspects of my life (big mistake) she flat out told me that I needed to get a boyfriend, because the reason why I was so sad and miserable is because I'm lonely, and that since I'm an adult now it was about time I stopped being single.

She kept repeating that all day and I can't help but feel eraged about it. If having a significant other was the key to all happiness then people in relationships wouldn't be able to have depression right? I want to argue with her but I know that doing so would be the equivalent of talking to a wall.

I feel awful right now. I just wished I had an understanding mom who treated me with respect and didn't assume she knew everything all the time.

I'm at a loss."

For the past 6 months I'm working at a Burger King, a job I've secured ever since I was high school sophomore. Working there was like my after-school activity, now it's beginning to look a like a lifetime hobby. Now all I do is live at my parents house, sleep and go to work. I'm always getting criticized by my whole family, my peers and even a co-worker dropped this comment “so you plan on working here for the next 5-10 years? Hell no!” “When are you going to get a real job?” That comment made realize how fucked I am. I don't think it's a good idea to spend the rest of my life working here. Honestly I'm being take advantage at this job, nobody works as hard as me, nobody appreciates my hard work, asking for a raise or becoming a manager is pointless, the minimum is 12 dollars an hour, even if I wanted to be a manager I’ll still be making 12 dollars an hour. 

I'm thinking about applying to community college this spring semester, because I can't continue to spend another 8 months being at the house getting disrespected. I get a lot thoughts that hold me back from doing this; I heard people say that going to college won't guarantee me a job, I don't need a degree for a high paying job, and student loans are a problem. I don't know what to believe. I don't know what's the safe route. If I continue just staying home and working at burger King, it's just going to get worse."
190fetc,Depression,2024-01-07,Am I depressed?,"I don’t even know why I’m posting on this, I might even delete it later, I don’t know. I can’t tell if I’m sad or depressed. I know I can’t really tell without actually getting diagnosed but still. I feel like nothing is worth it anymore, I feel sad all the time. I never want to get out of bed, the smallest tasks, like taking a shower or brushing my teeth feel like the biggest tasks in the world. Life just feels like the same old thing. Workout, School, homework,sleep. Wake up and repeat. I can’t get a good amount of sleep no matter what. I don’t even like working out, I do it just to keep my weight down(weight loss), but I can’t even seem to be doing that correctly now. No matter how much I exercise and restrict, it’s never enough. I’m not really interested in food anymore anyways to be honest. And I feel like it’s going to be like that for the rest of my life, workout and restrict, just like how it feels like life is a never ending cycle that I want to get out of. All the shows I used to enjoy, all the hobbies are all just something in the past now. I feel alone no matter who I’m with. And I just want to get out of this endless cycle, out of everything, I just want it to all end. I can’t talk to anyone about it, and I don’t know what to do anymore. I’ve grown desperate to find out what is with me. 

So am I just overreacting or actually dealing with something?"

I’ve been diagnosed with severe depression but for the longest I’ve been too depressed to even force myself to take medication. For years I never even realized it was depression. I just assumed I was lazy. It takes everything in me to complete simple tasks and I don’t look forward to my days because I’m exhausted before my feet hit the floor.

I have no support or village for my children which makes it even harder and their father is in the military and they have a strained relationship with him. Everything falls on me and I can’t even find the time to take care of myself. I just don’t know what to do anymore. I’ve always wanted to finish nursing school and I start class next week but I’m already overwhelmed I have no clue how I’m going to do it. My job is extremely stressful but if I don’t prioritize school, I’ll never be able to give us a better life. As time goes on it seems to get worse. Then the guilt of not being able to do all of the sports and extra things with my kids because I’m one person and can’t be in 3 places at once is overwhelming."

190dmq8,Depression,2024-01-06,I suddenly lost hope after waking up one day. Normal?,"
Thanks before you read this post because having help in this harsh time it’s really important to me, appreciate it.

Well I suffered an important depression problem being just 17 (Now I’m 19), about two years ago. I was with medication since then, for a year and a half, until last summer. Since then, without medication, everything was fine, things inside normality. Then some things happened that stressed me a lot, and I had to deal with “important” situations. I also suffered a stomach ache that punched me for a week and right then a cold problem that made me stay in bed for some days. I got lots of thoughts suddenly going through my head, like without control. And the day after I woke up feeling that despersonalization I felt in the past but now with a weird feeling, I felt lost, as if everything meant nothing. I lost hope, I realised that I didn’t had a life purpose. (I’ve been researching and it’s something called anhedonia probably).

I’m worried because sometimes suicidal thoughts appear in my head and I don’t want that, I really don’t want that and I know I will never do it but I feel lost, and really worried about those thoughts.

I talked with my friends about my situation and they tried to help me, also my family. And in a couple weeks I will go to my therapist. I don’t know what to do, it’s just as everything meant suddenly nothing, and this worries me a lot about what can I do with myself and if I will ever loose control.


Thank you so much."
190d5tg,Depression,2024-01-06,I hate my job I hate my life,I hate how stupid I am!!!!! I hate my existence!!!! Why was I born if I was gonna be this dumb. There’s no place in the world for idiots! I know it and clearly so does my boss. I finally got the hang of some things at my new job I felt so proud of myself. Then I do one new thing and can’t get jack shit!!!! I could see it so clearly hear it in the tone of their voice just thinking “why did we hire such a dumb bitch to work here!?”. I’m putting in my two weeks tomorrow I’m sure they’ll be relieved. With how dumb I am I really don’t get how I did okay in my last jobs. If somebody murdered me the world would be a better place without someone so incompetent.
190cr8g,Depression,2024-01-06,I’ve come to realize I’m depressed…I think it’s my mom’s fault…,"Now, I’m a 25F, still leaving with my mom. There is a couple of reasons and circumstances that led up to that. But let’s give some context and backstory here.

Childhood: Growing up with an abused mother who was also raised in abusive ways alongside being with abusive partners. Well, you can already tell that this person isn’t fit to parent any child. But yet, they took on the challenge in doing so. Doing my childhood, my mother had the tendency to raise her voice in anger over little things, hit me sometimes over the dumbest things, and literally give the silent treatment when she knows she’s wrong for acting a certain way, saying a certain thing, or doing a certain thing. I can already tell that growing under these circumstances and conditions, my mental health was left in a major state of distress. I’ve wanted to die since I’ve been in middle school and got outed for being “a cutter,” in my sophomore year of high school. I’ve always had this sense of worthless, helplessness, unwanted—like I was the biggest mistake she’s made. I’m sure she feels the same way about her other children. Without a doubt. But since I’m the only that lives with her, I’m getting that heat more than they are. Always have because I was the only one with her. Why? Because she escaped a bad relationship and came to the US and met my dad who was also not a great guy and had me as the end result…

Now: I’ve graduated college, it’s hard to find a job and I literally got my own shit to worry about. I accept my shortcomings and flaws. I don’t shy away from them. But I feel no matter how hard I try, it will never be enough. She wants to have a boosting moment with her friends so she also has something to show off. But all her kids and including herself is struggling. Which is to be expected, since we’ve never had it good anyway and things in the world just got harder. Right now, I’m just feeling around stressed with my own life that I NEVER asked for. I never wanted to be here. I feel people should be smart enough to know, if you are depressed, you are not fit to parent because the chances of that child becoming depressed is high. I don’t want to live anymore. This life isn’t worth it. Not with the people I got as family. I don’t have anywhere to run to and nowhere to hide. And I know the only reason I’m still even living here and why she hasn’t kicked me out is out of convenience. Someone to yell at. Someone to use as an emotional garbage can. Someone to get stuff she literally can herself. If I die, I’m sure only thing she’d probably miss was that she had someone around. I know I’m a mistake. And as a 25 year old, should I just remove myself from the world? 

I know I need help. I want help. But frankly, I’m just tired of myself and life in general…I was tired since middle school. It’s like there is nothing but fog. It’s hard to see where I’m suppose to go. And today, I realized…I feel better off dead. I think she wants me dead and gone if I’m not help…"
190cqdk,Depression,2024-01-06,Depressed and thinking about dying,"I have been severally depressed for most of my life but it got very bad in 2019 (I am 25) and, since my sister's suicide in October, it has gotten to a point where I actually bought a gun online and started to write letters for my family. I don't want to die but I don't want to keep going on like this. I have bad debt and no job right now because I am in and out of jobs, I totaled my car that my dad bought me in October and now use my brother's car. There's stuff with my family and I don't feel like I can trust anyone."
190coka,Depression,2024-01-06,Everything is so expensive,"This is kind of just a rant because I’m having a hard time lately. I’ve been on anti depressants for about a year now but I still sometimes spiral.

Everything is so expensive nowadays and even though I have a job at a company I’ve worked hard to move up in and pays more than minimum wage, I still feel like I’m just barely keeping my head above water. My husband and I have been trying to buy a house for years now but I’m worried it’ll never happen, and of course our rent at our apartment went up again this year. I can’t keep a savings account for the life of me because something will come up or just because of how expensive everything is and my paycheque is stretched thin enough as it is. We can barely manage to pay for our car, gas, groceries, and rent and other payments for our apartment without being completely broke by the time the next paycheque comes along. 

I’m turning 25 this year and this was always the age I pictured myself starting a family at. For as long as I can remember this is the age I was sure it would happen. But we still don’t have a home and if I can barely afford to feed myself, how am I ever supposed to afford to take care of a kid? I want to be a mom but financially I will never be able to. 

I also want to travel, to see the world. I’ve never left the country I live in and I probably never will. With everything else I have to pay for I should really just forget about traveling and doing things that I like. There’s not enough time or money for it. We usually try to take a small trip every year for our anniversary but at this point we’re still paying off going out of town last year so goodbye to our attempts at yearly trips.

I wish money didn’t consume my every waking thought like it does, but there’s just nothing I can do except watch everything get more expensive and think of how my parents and grandparents never had these worries. They got to live their lives and do things that they wanted to do but I’ll never get those same luxuries. I’m so tired."
190cnfj,Depression,2024-01-06,End it,"I'm at the point that I just don't want to live anymore. Since the beginning of the year, I have been thinking about how I can best end it every day.I don't want to harm anyone with my dead but I also want to end it quickly. For example, I would be very sorry for the train driver. I have a place where I could hang myself.I don't think I have the courage I don't have a car and I can't get sleeping pills.I just want to die why I can't fall asleep and can't wake up. I am twenty years old and have already lived my life.It wasn't good and just painful.I just don't want to anymore."
190ckjr,Depression,2024-01-06,My studies would send me to grave,"I am a biotechnology student, in two days I have very important exam I need to pass to take my final exam to get my degree. I can’t study I can’t eat, sleep or do shit. Anxiety driving me crazy and I still can’t bring myself to study. I procastinate like crazy and then stress over having too little time to learn anything. If I don’t get my degree this year I honestly imagine killing myself. I don’t feel like having support in my family or my boyfriend. I feel like no one understands me or my feelings at all. I feel like I’m waisting time and if I don’t pass this exam everyone would look at me like I’m the stupid one. My studies are pretty hard I do biotechnology engineering and I don’t want to fuck up. It would be the absolute end of the world for me. I booked a visit with my psychiatrist."

190c3zj,Depression,2024-01-06,My soon-to-be wife told me,"That she wished she moved to another city and lived alone instead of marrying me. This came out of nowhere, i did not force her to anything of that sort."
190bzju,Depression,2024-01-06,Hopelessness moving forward,"Just as the title says, I'm feeling a lot of hopelessness. 

I've dealt with depression on and off throughout my life, but this time I am just feeling stuck. 
I moved away from my city to be with a man who I had been dating for awhile. I really thought we had a future together, but it ended up in a breakup and now I feel trapped living in his house and he's not being the kindest. He wants to avoid me at all costs, and when he is around I never know what version of him I'm going to get. 

I had long Covid for 18 months, and it was difficult to work, and he was helping me out. I don't have the financial ability to relocate yet, and I'm terrified of getting reinfected again with Covid and being down and out again with health issues. That was a huge issue with the living arrangement...prior to living together, he agreed to live cautiously so I could recover, and I felt comfortable... and when I got here he said one thing, did another. It made my depression and anxiety skyrocket because I couldn't trust him. I still care a lot about him, but I know it's just not going to work... And I really don't recognize who he is anymore with how much things have changed.

I know once I get out, it will probably be better in terms of anxiety and feeling on edge, as it's tough living with an ex. But I am dreading starting all over again....I feel so lonely and isolated already and don't have many friends in this city. I've tried, it's difficult making friends as an adult ...and then having to take precautions to avoid sickness when the rest of the world is moving on and Covid rates are skyrocketing. I want something to look forward to, and I try to schedule things but I often don't have motivation to follow through and do them. It takes a lot to get out of bed sometimes and get done what I need to. I started antidepressants to try to combat all this but I don't feel a difference or they haven't taken effect yet. I don't know, I'm just looking for some support or comfort right now 😞"
190by28,Depression,2024-01-06,Drastically changed as a person but even more depressed,"So, as the title says, I've been through a few traumatic events (I won't mention because I feel that they are incredibly petty) that have changed me so drastically as a person that I don't recognize myself that much a more. The usual verdict of situations like this in my mind is that you've changed for the worse? Or maybe for the better right?

I know this is going to sound so damn cocky, and that's not my intention at all. 

I've realized how much deeper my mind goes in terms of emotionally accepting circumstances that were my fault. I've began realizing noticing that I'm able to understand people's emotions more often, and that I can accept fault much more frequently if not always. It's allowed me to accept I'm wrong and grow from that. To help even the balance, and make sure that everyone close to me is being heard and appreciated even if they don't have the same feelings towards me.

I feel like I'm not normal, I feel like I care too much, I'm insecure, I'm needy, question myself all the time. But I don't push it into others, instead I just want the truth. If I've done something wrong I want to know so I can change and become better. If I've hurt someone, as strange as this sounds, I want to know how badly I hurt them, so I can gain a better understanding and am able to be a ton more empathetic/sympathetic.

I feel this unbearable need to be better, and yet, the better and more understanding I become, the further into the deep dark hole of depression I fall into. I don't like the fact that I've been hurtful at times and that I've misunderstood or misinterpreted things.

I feel like this sort of emotional intelligence is a curse, a burden, because it makes me understand others emotions more deeply, and to be able to let them know I'm capable of being there for them, and helping them, and letting them be honest with me, no matter how hurtful or destructive it is.

Im hurting right now, I'm in such a intense amount of pain. I've been going to therapy for over 8 years and have been taking medication for just as long. I just feel like these emotions I'm feeling are so overwhelming and uncontrollable. I dont like fighting or arguments, I much prefer genuine discussions and talking through feelings.

I used to k be such an angry selfish little kid, with no consideration for others, it now, at the peak of my emotional state, I'm at the highest emotional intelligence I've ever been and at the loser point of depression. It's a maddening feeling. And I'm struggling so desperately to breath. 

Sorry if this didnt make sense. 

Thanks for reading"
190bwr4,Depression,2024-01-06,Loosing Job,"Hi,

I (37) am a single parent of an 11 year old child and have been suffering from depression for some years now. I take anti-depressants, recently switched from zoloft to wellbutrin. I have been a working single parent for 10 years now, and have managed to remain functional and keep my Job as a paralegal. In the last two years I have began to really struggle and made some big mistakes at work. One forcing me to give a statutory declaration. Today I discovered I have made my biggest mistake up to date. A dramatic mistake that cannot be helped. I am on annual leave and checked my email due to anxiety and will only be able to let my Boss know on Monday. 

Now I am in total crisis. I need to pay rent and am solely responsible for a whole other human,with no help or assistance. Due to that I have always been giving more than 100%. Which is so daunting, giving it your all and still completely failing. The last decade was always a struggle fighting for work life balance to meet my responsibilities as a mother as well as professionaly.

As I said I am in shock and I do not really know for what I am writing this. I feel completly desperate and am very isolated, so would appreciate anywords of encouragement very much. 

English is not my first language, so apologies for all mistakes."

When I was 15, I thought I treated my own depression. But the truth is I hid it inside covering it with fake smiles and laughs. I thought, ""I'm a man, I should fend for myself, I can't keep being sad forever."".

I was wrong.

Years went by, now im 19. The truth is, depression, when you keep it for too long, it will eat you.

I can't take it anymore. I want to reach for help, but im a man and I'm scared everyone will judge me for being weak. I want to k*ll myself so bad. But I don't want my parents to cry for me. And honestly,I'm scared.

Came home and found out she is locked in her room and I can't hear absolutely nothing through her door, tried to call her , push the door (our doors don't tecnicall lock, so she must have put stuff to prevent from opening), all this while not being able to scream at the entire family that I think she might be in danger BC my entire family at this point thinks she just likes to do emotional manipulation...

I have no energy to do anything because I’m so tired I usually just go to bed and I used to not be able to do that. My life if boring and I have nothing to look forward to. All life is is spending the first ~20 years of your life going to school so you can get a job to pay for bills, housing and food so you can to work the next day for the rest of your fucking life. Why do i fucking bother anymore. I don’t have the balls to kill myself because I don’t want my family to deal with what they might feel if something happened to me my life would be ruined if someone in my family killed themselves. I just want this to end. I just want a purpose in life and I can’t find it. There is nothing I find fun anymore and for Christmas I could not even make a list for my relatives because I legitimately wanted nothing. There is nothing I want. I want it to end"
190b36x,Depression,2024-01-06,"If I were to shoot myself, and I died tonight, I wonder if anyone would be by my side, would they tell me not to go as they cry into my clothes as I flatline, or am I really just a waste of space.","My grandma recently passed away from breast cancer last year, my dad is having an affair with his bosses sister and my mom is drinking and abusing drugs, my sister is known around my school as a whore because she basically gets paid to do dirty shit with students, my female babysitter raped me and physically, mentally, emotionally, verbally, spiritually, religiously, and sexually abused and assaulted me until I was 14 years old, my mother doesn’t even care enough to see that I openly leave self harm marks on my body, I have scars along my thighs and back, I tried suicide 4 times already, each time failed, my mom said she wishes they aborted me and my sister doesn’t even care about me, I feel like when I’m talking to god he doesn’t listen to my voice, I wonder if I ever belonged, I feel like I should disappear, I don’t want to be here anymore, should I end it all?, I don’t know anymore."

I’m tired, I either sleep too much or too little. I can’t concentrate on anything, and can never finish a task to safe my life. I cry may too much and I want to talk about it but I feel like no one in my life would understand. I’m just exhausted and nothing feels good anymore. I just don’t know what to do."

The only time when I don’t feel any pain is when I sleep and I just can’t seem to be able to do that now. I don’t know what to do. I am so tired from the pain. I don’t want to kill myself.

Whenever I see suicide data and statistics, this question always comes to my mind. Isn't being alive literally something you get once? (So rare to happen too). so why do they just waste it? Even if they're being tortured, abused, and assaulted every day (which isn't even the case for most people they just broke up or something), it's surely better than just being dead for eternity."

191vj80,Depression,2024-01-08,Just too tired,"I’m tired of this life. I’m 24 and work so much I don’t have time to see friends or family. Even on my days off I’m too depressed to want to do anything. I’ve been in a long distance relationship for the past 2 years and we both work constantly and never have time to come see each other and now we’re most likely about to break up because I have an undiagnosed mental illness that is ruining my life and is causing too much stress on my girlfriend. All I’ve ever wanted was for a quiet life and a happy relationship but I have neither and I just want to give up. I don’t talk to anyone in my life about my depression much or at all because I worry that it’s too much for them to have to think about. 

I often think about just letting go and finding a way out but I don’t want to yet because then my death would be an immense financial burden on my family. The past month has just been worse and worse, I want it all to be over. I don’t want to suffer seeing another person I love leave me and never speak to them again. I don’t want my family to have to mourn me, I wanted to live a long life and maybe raise a kid and give them a childhood my father never could. I feel unheard by the people in my life, but I can’t tell them about this because they’ll think I want to kill myself. And probably rightfully so. It’s just so hard anons."

Every time my parents gone I just start crying mostly because I just feel like my parents life would be easier if I wasn't with them."
191tlc6,Depression,2024-01-08,Thinking is a chore,"For me, thinking is a chore. Years back I first noticed that I need to be motivated and gradually pump myself up to think, otherwise I would be perfectly content blankly staring at my phone or doing repetitive menial tasks without deep thinking. Being in a barely functional mental state is relaxing and almost euphoric, but obviously leaves me vulnerable and unproductive. 

One way I’m able to gauge how bad my current state is is by taking note of how often I reuse recently used words- especially in situations where I need to respond quickly. It’s like my mind is in the clouds and it can’t bother with pulling out better fitting words from long term storage. I have a hard time cooking simple meals or even doing basic cleaning without forgetting where things are located. And it doesn’t just affect my memory- logical conclusions to situations/problems I *eventually* come to aren’t nearly as accurate/valid as the ones I come to in a fraction of the time when my brain fog clears. 

This brain fog comes in waves where it gets even worse, but it’s generally always an exercise for me to think- no matter the topic. I know for certain that I have OCD (debilitating and something I received a diagnosis for), but I suspect I might also suffer from ADHD or depression, or both. I was prescribed Adderall years ago for these symptoms (wasn’t ever given a diagnosis for ADHD), but was too afraid of the side effects and horror stories to take it. 

**OCD trigger warning, seriously stop reading if you have it**


To top it all off, I have a form of OCD rooted in my fear for my inability to think- once it kicks in my stream of thoughts are severed and I become hyper aware over when and how I think. This actually affects my cognitive ability even more than my brain fog, but I ironically feel more at ease when it flares because I feel as though I’m less in control of it. But when combined, I can be stuck in an even deeper “slump” that I can’t leave for weeks or even longer."

191ogff,Depression,2024-01-08,I don't know anymore,"I'm going to get straight to the point. I just turn 18 this year and everything just came crashing down. I'm afraid to write it here, but I just can't keep it to myself anymore and going to let it all out. (English is my second language, so bear with me)

2021 was shit, but it was more of a burnout, so it was not too shit. School started to go downhill and same with life. Until around January, when I started going back to school and tackled life a bit. 2022 was good enough to continued life and just 2 more grades left in high school for me to graduate. School comes back around oct and ngl I prepare it like it was nothing. I'm basically ready.

Then comes 2023, life is good and it was eleventh grade. At the beginning of January when I came back from a little holiday with my dad for my birthday, and suddenly I started to screwing things up with school somehow. I can't wake up and go to school, I was somehow got left in every subject. It's like I got star struck by something (tbh it was a good little holiday). Moving to February, It got way worst because I enrolled in an English course and it flipped so hard that I have to stopped. And then I started to skipping school and everyone's mad, and then I'm gone.

Until one time when my uncle randomly come inside my room and start talking to me properly and I cry. She asked what's wrong and I try my best to talk. It didn't change a lot that day, but I started coming back somehow. Even though school wasn't that great, still I got back on my feet and have a bright future ahead again. I also realized that I'm not going to see my friends a lot again so I hanged out a bit more because soon I will change to a different school when I finish eleventh grade.

When I finished, I have some time for myself because my new school started later then my previous one. I take care of myself physically and mentally, go to the gym with my mom, explore some new games, hangout with friends a bit and prepare for my twelve grade. It was good and I thought that I'm back.

Until the first day in a new school, I fucked up the first day by not getting the dress code right and I thought I prep enough but I didn't. I met total strangers I thought I can make friends with but I was wrong. Sure I make like 3 friends but it wasn't really friends (more like just co-workers you just meet at work and not after work). It wasn't good but I don't fell right back to worst version of myself. Until nostalgia hits and make think all kind of stuff that makes me want to go back but it wont be the same and my parents don't want me to and all they talked about is school and not care or ask one BIT on how I was doing (it's not new but it gotten way worst and I got enough). Christmas wasn't that bad but It was not the same and new year was good too but still just not the same. 2024 Jan 6, I turned 18. My mum and dad do get something for me but all they talk about is school and compared me to some other shit. Also I think my friends started to forget me and again started slowly going back to where I was in the beginning of 2023 again. Until this point, I am absolutely done with everything. Everyone in my family is the same, school fucked up in thousands disastrous ways possible &amp; my mind is in shambles.

I don't know what to do anymore.

I lost hope for my future in everyway possible right now and people just don't understand it. It's hard to also reach out too. I cope with music and whatever is online to distract myself and sooner or later I try commit suicide but I somehow can't. 

Edit: I not sure what I'm even writing here and just combine words together but it nice to let it all out  "
191o9h8,Depression,2024-01-08,Deformity on face,I’ll soon be 26 and am having a hard time accepting that I’ve never had a relationship. The guys I match with just make me so sad. I want to be a better version of myself but I don’t think I can. I’m constantly told I have an “enviable” body. But my jaw was recently diagnosed with a deformity. Last week i cut my arm for the first time. It wasn’t too deep but is still healing. I’m just not sure how to accept the cards I’ve been dealt. I feel like I have no chance of happiness and haven’t been working when I’m supposed to. Just want to shut down .

I experienced worst and worst. 

I'm so tired of being at the center of being worst nightmare. My life is fucked up. There is no saving me. I know that I'm heading towards to way down. 

It always drains me out and there is nothing to drain out of me. 

So, I gues this is what I deserve but I want to know what I did to deserve this at least."
191bxtm,Depression,2024-01-08,I’m so miserable and it happened in two months.,"I’m 21, My bills are two months behind, I have no money. I just got fired from my job of two and a half years and been at another one for a month that I don’t enjoy half as much.

 I’ve never had a girlfriend and never been in love. I met this girl (28) about a month ago around when I got fired and we’ve been doing molly and psychedelics and drinking a lot of tequila and this is a world I’m semi-new to. Also tried ketamine twice. I’ve been staying with her instead of my apartment and my dog has been at my mom’s since basically Christmas which isn’t her responsibility whatsoever. I know for a fact I’m in love with this girl but she’s moving states in 2 days which was already a known thing before I caught feelings which makes me even dumber. 

I’m so depressed and miserable and I was never a person to be emotionally dependent or reliant on someone else until I met her. I’ve done molly with her like 10 times in the past month and think I’ve done permanent damage to my brain (seratonin, cognitive function, etc.) I wasn’t always this way. I can’t even be alone in a room without having a panic attack and they go away when I’m with someone. Did I ruin my life? I don’t see myself ever loving a girl this way and I trust my gut with that. 

How do I move forward?"
191a4t2,Depression,2024-01-08,Is This More Than Depression?,So it's been over a year now that I've been sitting home unemployed with my dogs while my friend works and pays the bills. I only pay a small portion from my savings but my problem is getting a job. I have had jobs contact me for openings but I always tell myself not right now or tomorrow I'll call back. Then all day I'll be bored to the bone. I don't understand why I mentally defeat myself when an opportunity arises.
191fzgs,Depression,2024-01-08,"I'm bitter, envious, and jaded.","Bitter: I've always been full of self-hatred and the ""glass half empty"" mentality since I was 8 years old. How the heck do I change this mindset at 30? Everything I see in life has a dark side. Anytime I see joy or positivity, I immediately see the flipside and ruin my mood.

Envy: I don't openly express this because people will dislike me, but I hate seeing success of others. I'm a gay, broke, obese school teacher living in a nobody town. If I hear that someone is straight, or wealthy, or has a nice body, or working a job that commands respect (STEM field, entrepreneur, etc) I feel like absolute crap. 

Jaded: I've NEVER had a relationship because I'm short, fat, and God didn't choose me to be well-endowed. Oh and I have acne keloids on my head. I feel like a hideous mutant. I cannot open myself to love. No one will love me. No one will accept me. I'm stuck like this. Thank you God. Thank you parents.

My partner hates me. I have no friends. I have gotten fat and ugly. I've wasted my 20s and there's nothing good coming for me in my future. I can'take anyone happy or be a good person.

My job is generally very understanding and seems to be one of the few good companies out there. A lot of people work remote so everyone has weekly one on one meetings with their superiors to check in on work and other things. Should I let him know I'm not doing so good recently? Or does this just make me more of a liability/target? I've been struggling badly for a few months, hoping this wave would pass, but it's just not this time around. I know it will, but it's really taking a toll on me in the meantime. The most I'm expecting to get out of it is just bettering our relationship, showing that I can trust my boss with this information and hoping he's happy I'm able to come to him with it, and hoping he's willing to meet me at a patient, understanding state of mind.

I'm a 26 year old female. I have no job prospects because I'm nothing but a time waster. The only jobs I've done before was when I was younger. I worked as a graphic designer while going to a design school for a while until I switched majors to computer science. I focused on college (miserably) and failed everything. I started helping my mother out at her workplace as a family thing so she can take my father to his health appointments when needed.

  
I just don't understand coding no matter what and I feel like a fucking failure. I have absolutely nothing to be proud of or to be happy about. I tried being honest about things with my older brother but I got yelled at for crying. I feel like I have no one in my family to talk to and it kills me so bad. My older brother says I ""never let anyone criticize me"" and he's right. I never bothered to do anything with programming or even tried to look for jobs. I feel like I will never self improve even though I really fucking want to. I don't know where to start. I'm so scared of failure. I wasted the last few years caring for my dad, cleaning up after him, feeding him, and so on and it fucking kills me.

  
I'm currently in therapy but my mental state took a serious spiral ever since my dad got worse with his health. I've done absolutely nothing with my life so far and I hate myself for it.

Never thought I would be here, but here I am. I don’t want to tell anybody I know because they’ll just get worried. I have been feeling like I can’t go on anymore. This past year, I’ve been going through so much pain physically and mentally. Found out mom’s health is deteriorating and I am trying my best to help. A few months ago my girlfriend of 6 years broke up with me and told me she doesn’t love me anymore. I got jumped a couple of weeks ago and almost died, so now I’m on medication for physical pain. I toss and turn at night and can’t sleep. I cant even seem to focus at my job. I go for drives late at night to clear my mind. I honestly just want to disappear from this world, but I can’t. My mom needs me. My brothers need me. I don’t know what to do. I recently started crying and I can’t stop. I don’t know what to do. Anybody have any suggestions?"

Everyone in my family completed their degrees no problem and are successful, yet here I am struggling in first year and staying in my room constantly. I see people from my high school partying at their universities and it makes me feel like I’m the only one who is struggling this bad."

1912i3i,Depression,2024-01-07,I guess it’s time to get medicated,"Depression rant here…I just don’t know how and where to begin. I have always feared medication and anything with medical facilities due to various reasons. I’ve been there twice, one time during my teens and later again, at 24, where I got diagnosed with MDD with psychotic features and BPD. Soon after I was only a little better I closed this chapter as if something to forget and like, I will find ways to live a fulfilling life without meds, it will fade out.   
Now coming to terms that maybe I have been dumb and delusional as fuck to believe all these years that it is gonna ‘somehow heal and just go away’. It’s been the same cycle ever since. I simply couldn’t see that sometimes it’s your brain and not any surrounding circumstances. But I shoved it off as ‘maybe if I reach this goal or move to x place and start a new life, it will magically disappear because I’m not of the severely depressed folks who sit in facilities and can’t barely get out the bed - is what I thought. 
It’s just that in between, I’ve been able to get new jobs and hold them (for short time periods) for a couple of years and sometimes I felt so great that I believed I’m ultimately healed. That’s what made me delusional, that the phases in between just are what they are and likely tied to difficult circumstances.

For almost my whole life I’ve been seriously depressed. I’ve experienced the whole wide range of episodic depression and it’s ugly heads. Now that I find myself AGAIN in this disgusting state of oversleeping, barely moving, not being able to get easiest shit done, clean up my place, feeling suddenly ugly and dumb and unable for no reason, I just want relief finally and medication is becoming my only hope. I could have lived a different life, had I given meds a chance. Maybe not picture-perfect life if my dreams, but actually a life where I cherished my youth and health and used it and met people just because I had the desire to and saw beauty in me and in the world instead of the opposite. 

The disease is still there and it has still been the.fucking.same. A true parasite in your mind and body. I am experiencing an episode now and it’s exactly the same as it has been in my early 20s. It’s just more hopeless and anxious in later life, because there are too many things that belong to a lifetime that people like us are simply not able to cope with, compared with ‘normal’ people. I’m scared of the future and I feel like I really, really won’t last long. 
So if you read this and you are experiencing depression symptoms creeping up on you, but you still are somewhat able to appear normal on the outside and get some things done, what you get done is the bare minimum, be honest with yourself and please talk to a professional and give medication a chance. It will likely be a longer journey to find the right mix, but it’s better than regretting years later not giving science a chance.

1911m1o,Depression,2024-01-07,I've reached what's the point status,"Actually, I've been there for a while. It's just hitting harder now. I've had therapy for years. Currently on meds. Nothing seems to help. I feel I'm destined to be alone, miserable, unsuccessful.. Etc.. 

I don't have active friends anymore. I've tried to make online friends just for conversation, but no one ever sticks around. 

I don't see the point in trying much longer. Haven't been happy in years, and at this point I don't expect to ever be. I don't know what my point is in posting. I'm just typing words. I feel I'm talking to myself. Screaming into the void.

190xpms,Depression,2024-01-07,"I'm a seafarer that came home from a 9 month contract, and since I came home I didn't do anything but just isolate my self in my bedroom","I just play wildrift and browse/watch tiktok, YouTube and read manga and manhwa occasionally 

That's all I've been doing from December 19 till now,

I'll sleep in 1300H then wake up at 2000H then between those times I'm just lying down in my bed with my phone,

To be honest I find myself not enjoying what I'm doing lately, I feel like I'm wasting my time but I don't want to interact with others 

During December 25 I didn't even get out of my room to greet the visitors of my parents and I just went out of my room to eat when it's already 2100H, it's like I dont want others to see me, 

During new year count down I joined my mother and sister in the living room to wait for new year and eat, my father is not home but with his friends drinking,
But at 0130 H of January 1 I returned to my room and didn't left it till evening again, even when there's visitors and they're singing karaoke and having a good time


And now it's alreay January 8 and I'm still like this, just in my room lying down and doom scrolling, 


Do I have depression? Or am I just lazy? 

I just think I got burn out with life because of my last contract, during the whole thing I find myself hating the whole thing because of our psychopath Captain and push over chief mate of the ship, 


I just wanna rant and write down what I'm feeling

Sorry for the English"

Someone just told me I don't do enough work on myself which I agree to some but I'm already depressed and lonely. 

I wanted to get up earlier and be more active but everyday I wake up I feel awful about my life and can't motivate myself to get up early and I just want to go back to bed. I feel better later in the day.

I don't talk to any of the friends I've made regularly and my family likely thinks I'm a failure.

In school I didnt have any friends and stuck mostly to myself. I got bullied quite a bit and I made some regrettable choices which still affects me mentally today.

I just want to be someone my family is proud of. I tried picking up reading again but I don't do exercise in the morning.

I know I can't afford to stay at home all day being inactive but it's so hard to get up and do anything."

I know I can't help my SO, but he won't seek professional help cuz it's 'hopeless'. That's why I'm trying to make him feel better anyway. But again, whatever I say to him like encourage to try doing something with his mental health or to do simple tasks for his wellbeing Im faced with 'it's all hopeless, so why would I do anything'. 

It affects me in various ways. I started to fail some exams (I have very stressfull degree course), I can't study or focus, because I worry about him, I started developing suicidal thoughts. I even fantasize about being with somebody who's just happy.

I blame myself for showing any saddness or tiredness. Sometimes I also try to be more distant from his problems, but it results in guilt.

I just don't know what to do anymore. It feels like I'm the worst person, that can't even be strong and supportive for the person I love."
190sbk8,Depression,2024-01-07,Was I depressed and didn't know it? Should I seek help even though I feel better now?,"Last year was bad. 

I found out a lot of family secrets and also that my mother had a lot of debt and she's been cheating and lying to the entire family. A lot of things happened and for some reason I don't even remember it clearly. I felt like everything was blurry. Every part of my life was falling apart. 

As a result I became suspicious of everyone and everything. I would get angry for stuff. The hopelessness was so heavy. I felt like I had no way out. I had massive trust issues and would doubt everything. I had reached a point where I would suspect my mother had poisoned the food  she cooks. I would also cry randomly. I had horrible nightmares. And things kept getting worse. I would sit in a dark room and cry alone. I had such bad memory that I wouldn't remember anything. I would constantly complain about the life I could have had. I would constantly constantly complain about how hopeless my life is. I would get into arguments with everyone. I felt like I could never get good sleep because I had a dark cloud over my head. 

My bf was being supportive initially and he would try to make me feel better, take me out. But I started doubting him too and started accusing him of cheating on me and having other girlfriends. I would get triggered if his voice gets louder and I would feel like he's shouting at me. I would dump my emotions on him and threaten to break up with him if he doesn't do what I ask. 

I couldn't see things clearly. I always had 1000 thoughts running in my head and I couldn't control it. 

Weekends were more miserable because I had to stay home and it make me miserable and more paranoid.

My bf left me because I was making his life miserable. I understand that.

I haven't been to therapy nor taken any professional help. But reading about depressing online makes me realize I was going through it and didn't realize it. 

Now for the past 2 days I've been feeling so good because I'll be getting more pay from next month and I feel like some burden has been lifted off me. I even started drawing again(it was my hobby before and I stopped it). I have started caring about the people in my home and the thought of seeing my parents face doesn't make me angry anymore. This has been happening only in the past 2 days. 

So am I better? Is this the calm before the storm? Am I really better now?"
190kuyq,Depression,2024-01-07,Everything everywhere all at once,"You spend hours in your head, imagining different scenarios and paths of how your life could turn out. 
It feels like your real life is on autopilot. You work various jobs but somehow still feel like you’re just a character in your life. You find minimal enjoyment and everything seems so futile. You set goals, and when you reach them you still feel… empty.
You look any &amp; everywhere for some type of inspiration.. Just some confirmation that things will be ok yet you still get this melancholy feeling about everything. 
You silently dream about the life you desire, you make small goals and crush them on the path to getting to that “dream life”
Every step you make or every decision you choose to take, you're so afraid of people judging you when in all honestly, you've grown to accept that judgment comes. This world even judged Jesus.
You begin to get sad about how life would be years down the line and no future seems right for you. Sometimes you contemplate that maybe death at a young age would end the mental torment you feel. 
You've deleted social media yet you still feel the looming effects of FOMO or that somehow someway you'll be negatively looked at or maybe that you aren't “capitalizing”. 
You step outside and see the abandoned buildings and treacherous behavior in the city that you are from. So you just wanna get away. 

 Feels like you have the potential to be ANYTHING or NOTHING at all.

190crst,Depression,2024-01-06,"21yo. And desperate. it's a nightmare, it’s hell.","Hi everyone,

I'm 21, I should be full of energy, having fun and thinking about my future. but I can't, I'm too sick. I am desperate

have a diagnosis of ADHD with generalized anxiety and depression.
For ADHD I'm sure, being symptoms I've always had. But I have never had problems with tiredness, fatigue, low mood, constant sadness, constant anxiety etc. ..

until two years ago, when for no reason, the nightmare began

In the last two years, in addition to the ADHD symptoms, some things have been added that make my life truly unlivable. It is a strong general malaise, both physical and mental.
I'll describe the symptoms:
In the morning I wake up tired, without strength, already sad.
I immediately felt the strong physical fatigue. I do not want to do anything. the anxiety is constant, my mind is constantly moving. It's an anxiety that I feel physically. I feel it in my chest, and in my stomach. This, together with fatigue and tiredness, make me feel really ""uncomfortable"", I don't know how to put it, in my body. I'm sick, it seems like I'm sick. It's just a general malaise.
If I work, I necessarily have to take stimulants or high doses of caffeine, otherwise it is impossible for me to face a working day.
If I'm not working, without stimulants or caffeine, I spend all day on the couch or in bed doing nothing.


Of medications I have tried Wellbutrin, Lamictal, Methylphenidate (both IR/ER), Vyvanse, Selegeline, and Modafinil.

The only ones that worked were stimulants, but unfortunately not very well. Both Methylphenidate and Vyvanse are perfect during the effect. They take away any symptoms of anxiety, depression, fatigue, they lift my mood, I feel happy, I feel good, I have concentration, motivation, my mind switches off and above all I am CALM.

The problem, unfortunately, is the duration and the crash.
The Ritalin ONLY lasts me 1 hour, the Methylphenidate ER about 3 hours, and the Vyvanse about 4-5.
the methylphenidate crash is the worst. terrible. extreme anxiety and paranoia. very ugly.
the vyvanse crash is much softer, but it's still there, and it's annoying. There is no stability. They work, ok, but it's a continuous Up and Down during the day.

I'm currently trying Strattera+wellbutrin, for a month, but I still don't feel anything.

The blood tests are perfect. Out of curiosity, I also did the hormonal blood tests, which were also perfect. Testosterone even above average. Thyroid fine. Physically I'm fine

I do not know what to do. I have a feeling this will never end."
190b5hp,Depression,2024-01-06,Is self isolation a sign of depression ?,"I’ve never been the kind of person to go out, I mean sure I’ve done some parties but I never really liked spending the night drinking or well… socializing. I think, like of people here, I struggle with finding a balance, although each time I find the one that fits me I feel guilty because others don’t do the same. Tonight, some friends suggested a party that a group in my uni organizes, the theme seems pretty cool (the 2000s)but I really don’t feel like going. I’m trying to convince myself it’s because of classes but I know that deep down, it’s because I simply don’t want to. Spoiler alert, I’m the most boring uni student ever : I never go out and go back home every week end because I prefer the comfort of being alone at home than being surrounded by people when’re i feel consistently like overwhelmed, judged. I fear that this mindset is preventing from experiencing things a normal person should experience l, but at the same time it’s not like I want to either. It’s a constant battle of reason and heart, everyday o wonder if I don’t keep myself from doing things only because I don’t want to do anything. And it’s exhausting. I really don’t wanna face people at this party, I want to read my book in peace, but at the same time : shouldn’t I just go because of my friends ? 
Don’t know how if this makes any sens tho."

I feel like a failure and judged at home by my family I feel so worthless and empty I can't and don't feel joy and I often get that gut wrenching feeling where i'm miserable I just want someone to relate to to know i'm not the only one. I feel like i'm going crazy genuinely because i also experience extreme mood swings and my psychiatrist told me that i have bpd traits and idk what that means, but i rather be at the mental hospital again than being here. I often feel so angry/impulsive too it's like i feel intense extreme emotions and it's so exhausting. I feel like i'm wasting my teenage years what do I do and will it get any better? To cope I sh and smoke weed. Also i'm like high every single hour not even joking and I realize that's a problem, due to this ive been saying out of pocket things like singing laughing making jokes and apparently i act like a bitch? around my family and i feel like a shitty person because of this like i'm just trying my best to not kill myself.

I've been bad before but I'm just atrocious now. I get no relief, just CONSTANT thoughts of ending it, all day, after waking up from either a PTSD nightmare or a dream of friends I no longer have.

I've made a draft. Went through all my photos on all devices and got rid of anything sketchy (unsolicited dick pics etc) in case my mum wants to see them. I was blessed with a deathly allergy a few years ago so my way out is *chefs kiss*. Small mercies.

Anyway I have it all planned, but the only thing keeping me here is knowing it would wreck my mum, who isn't even speaking to me right now.

1909fpa,Depression,2024-01-06,how to find regulation especially during times of transition?,"I just graduated in May and started my first real full time job 3 weeks ago. I graduated with a physics degree that specialized in engineering. Throughout my college experience I heard about how my degree/course of study ""wasnt valid/real"" so when it came time for me to get a job, I found a ton of imposter syndrome with me. I applied to about 50 jobs, interviewed twice, and got 2 offers. I took the job closest to my parents house which happened to be sorta near where my boyfriend is getting his masters degree over the next two years.  
The job described in the offer is very different from the actual job execution- I was told it would be collaborative, intersectional, and well guided as an entry level position. Every day, I sit in a sea of silent cubicles looking at ""trainings"" without instructions and try to teach myself very specific tasks. I'm disappointed. I have to drive about an hour each way from my parents house to get to this job. I feel like I have no time or space to pursue my happiness- both with time constraints from work/commute and due to living in my parents house. I'm grateful to not pay rent, groceries, or even my own car insurance right now, but I cannot make that gratitude spin into joy. At work, I feel like I have no guidance and when I ask for guidance, I'm assured that it's normal to have no idea whats going on and that I wont understand the full scope of my position for about a year.  
I'm frustrated. There's got to be a better life than this right? I know I have it pretty good but I am depressed and my anxiety has been really difficult to moderate. I feel like I made a mistake taking this job but that its also a. too early to tell and b. that I'm not even qualified for it in the first place and should be grateful that I'm making any amount of money right now. I've been trying to find a new therapist for months now so I can lay off telling my family about what I'm feeling, but it seems like no one is available. It feels like life is a catch 22."

I don’t use illicit drugs anymore but I have been feeling an urge to go back or thinking of them often. 

I am on venalfaxine and concerta, buspirone. I feel it helps me to feel “normal” or what I think a normal person should feel like. As when I’m not on medication I felt very empty and depressed. After stopping drugs my life didn’t get happier. I was at home and afraid to leave house, would cry so easily. 

At least now I would think I don’t cry or feel extreme emotions. But still feels like something is wrong with me. 

I have a Therapy where we work through negative thoughts and all that stuff. 

motivation is hard 

I do exercise and i feel that helps in the moment. But next day back to the old me. So it feels like everyday I have to battle to not be down. Is that normal way to live ? sorry I’m not good at articulate my thoughts in. Structured way. I was thinking to use AI to tidy it up but then I feel like is that cheating.

However recently things have just gotten horrific. In the last year I accepted a promotion but am struggling with the work as although I get great feedback from managers I feel like I’m barely making it.

I’ve lost my beloved dog, who I love more than most of my family members. I put the bills on credit cards and now I’m permanently broke.

I found out by brother look naked pictures of me in the shower (without my knowledge- obviously). However I can’t report this as I no longer have the proof and he also took photos of my sister and she just wants to forget everything. 

My nan is also very ill in hospital. And my family are pretty useless.

 I feel like everything is getting on top of me. I am already on antidepressants.

Does anyone have any suggestions because I literally feel like I’m just hanging on. People say to talk about it, but what’s the point? It isn’t going to solve anything.

After I stopped taking the med, I still feel okay. I don’t feel sad or any other physical symptoms, I just feel like it’ll be better if I’m dead since my life sucks. I don’t think that I have depression cuz others are more severe than mine. I never cry unlike others so I think I’m just faking, maybe I’m just lazy and tired instead of having depression.
Is that possible that I don’t even have depression at the first place. Maybe i was faking it that’s why I don’t feel depressed even after I stopped taking the medicine."
1907uwx,Depression,2024-01-06,I really cannot seem to see a way out this time TW:s***idal,"Sorry if the text does not come across clearly. I am not lucid in the slightest, I just feel as if my head had a massive weight inside of it. I (28f) believe I have been depressed for most of my existence. I know I was, and I have gone through therapy, however my therapist never referred to me as such, and I thought it might be true, because I was functional. I always did what I had to do, in between periods of constant sleep and tiredness, I always provided what I had to, in my study, in work and whatnot. I worked and studied abroad, traveled, learned new languages, made many friends, all while still somehow feeling creeping sense of self loathing or detaching myself from others while still being physically present. And sleeping a lot. And being lazy. My parents and sibling called me lazy, they refer to me as lazy, jokingly, and it bugs me but at the end of the day they’re  right. Cause there was no way to explain how someone could still meet their goals or not fail completely but spend hours on end on the bed or procrastinate over the stupidest little things

Now I just spent the past 5 months searching for a job after finishing a master’s degree. My family is now struggling financially and I as the eldest cannot even provide and help. I am not looking for a dream job right now, I applied to almost anything just to be able to provide for myself in the meantime and I still am unable to find anything. I don’t even know what I want to do and I am now realising that ever since becoming an adult I never really engaged myself in what I like. And after all of what I spent my time over I can’t find a job. And I see the disappointment in my dad’s eyes even tho he tries to tell me it’s not my fault. But he is disappointed cause I can’t do anything now. I have no energy to do anything. I just lay in bed for hours on end. And everything seems like a waste
I feel like a waste.
And I just want to finally end it, I wish I had the courage. But I know it will devastate my family, my sibling just recently is starting to get over their mental health issues and taking day by day and they love me, and my parents will be broken. My friends will too.

I wonder how one can be surrounded by so much love and still feel like this. I feel for those who don’t have this kinda love and feel like I do."

I dont feel better though..I just feel more stuck, because now I dont have the option in my mind as a way to relieve the pain. The only thing holding me back is family, specifically my niece (16) who is struggling as well with similar things I have. I love her so much, and we have such a strong bond. She admits I’m the only one she feels comfortable talking to about her mental health including her bf. Im scared of how losing me as her support would affect her, so I suppose you can see this as a pro because its keeping me going…but at what cost. Ive tried alternative therapy and self care for her sake to make it more manageable for myself. Im in therapy, my GP is medicating me( even though he knows nothing about mental health), Ive reached out to psychiatrists for better med management bc what my GP is doing is not helpful, Ive tried TMS and neurofeedback (by far the most helpful) but my provider moved out of state and I cant find anyone else in the area who will reply to my inquiries, and Ive tried getting an ADA for work accommodations to help for a YEAR now and they keep saying “we need clarification” basically refusing to work with me without saying it (it feels like they keep dicking me around to get me to give up so they dont have to accommodate my needs). Im at a loss. I dont know what else to do but I am falling further and further into the abyss. Other than work all I do is sleep. I went to my GP out of desperation, clearly having a anxiety attack through the appt,  and all he did was he changed my meds for the millionth time and he legit told me “i cant make excuses for you” and “do better”.

It's just so tiresome, everything is. I'm so tired and I hate the way I am and feel each day.

I'll probably end up homeless in the near future, and I'll freeze to death in some forest with nobody there beside me. That's probably for the best.

19070hk,Depression,2024-01-06,is it worth it?,"For context, I had this circle of friends whom I considered were my best friends in college since year 1 till (half of) year 3. I admired them so much and share them almost everything about my life; including my PTSD, Excoriation Disorder, ADHD diagnosis, my backstory on how I developed these including my main triggers.

Before my diagnoses, I was exceptional at school. I was very active in school events and even became a scholar! When I was in my 2nd year of college, that's when I started visiting my psychiatrist and got diagnosed and given all sorts of medications (I'd say we were doing some trials and errors on what works best for me). Due to this, I started fluctuating academically because I was struggling so hard with the presence of ""brain medications"" in my body. 

When I told my (former) circle of friends what had happened, they showed support; especially this one (former) guy friend (let's call him Levi) who occasionally messages me to ask how I was doing and spitting out supportive messages-- or so I thought.

In the same circle, my 2 (former) gal friends and Levi were fighting during our 3rd year of college. While I was talking to one of them (my former gal friends), Girl 1 all of a sudden spills all the bad triggering things that Levi has been saying behind my back. Making it look like his ""supportiveness"" is just a front/ an act. Her spilling it could be due to the fact that she was finding an ally to back her up. Idk.

He told her such triggering words such as ""I'm not as smart as I used to be"" and that ""I don't deserve to be in position (of an organization)"". I spiraled into a panic attack in an instant. 

Levi, as described by them, is indeed toxic. Due to what had happened, they had established that they'll be cutting him off for good. And so am I.

Not until, they started talking again and hanging out again. I felt like I was disregarded and felt alone. I did try to join their hangouts but I just can’t. What he had said was so triggering that Levi, himself, became one of my triggers at the time. I was so hurt and felt betrayed. The incident was so bad, I even had a severe panic attack during class and decided to stop studying all of a sudden because I was having severe intrusive thoughts and had multiple suicide attempts. All the hard work I put into therapy and medications were all put to waste as I it felt like I was back in square one.  

Fast forward to a year later (which is now), I’m back at school; finished one semester already and continuing where I stopped (aka back in 3rd year). But this time, I’m all alone. I made no friends last semester for the incident have left me a trauma to trust people again. 

Before the New Years, Girl 1 messaged me via email and my facebook. She seems to be hoping that we could make up. The problem is… she never said the word “sorry” in the paragraph and that the message comes off as something that’s sarcastic in a way AND she was telling a lot of contradicting statements For example (non verbatim), “I care about you BUT I don’t care whether you hate me even more or not after reading this”. It’s like,,,, she cares but then she doesn’t really..? A few days already passed since I read that letter and I’ve thought about if making up with her was worth it or not? After all, she’s the one who spilled Levi’s secrets, established that we’ll be cutting off the toxic dude but then she’s friends with him again then left me AND never acknowledged her wrong-doing."
1906kz5,Depression,2024-01-06,I don't want to killmyself but I don't want to be alive,"Basically - I hate the way I'm and I hate the way life is. I feel like there's no hope if you got shitty cards in life and the best scenario is just living decent while enjoying some pleasures from time to time. There's no amount of books or other shit to make it right. People with good lifes will enjoy it, brilliant and wise people with shitty lifes will suffer. And by shitty cards I mean mainly parents - how fucked up is this that people who raise you and have huge inpact on shaping you can be terrible and totally incompetent in parenting people. I wouldn't put a hamster under their custody, and those people teached me live. There are things that we all know are fucked up but we don't mention. If you can't invite a girl to your house, all will ""understand"" that you are in not the best situation, but none will want to be with you. 

I don't see perspectives, the only aspect of life I'm satisfied by is my body, because I like lifting weights and do it consistently, but what do I even need this for if I barely leave the house? And, as I live in a shithole in Poland, there's not many reasons to leave home anyway. Few days pass and I want to drink or smoke, I don't usually play videogames anymore because I feel guilty that I waste time, I'm not thinking about it when I'm drunk.

The sheet weight of what has happened to me and where I am now, let’s me safely conclude that this is really it. I think there’s trauma and then there’s trauma that you just can never mentally recover from. A limb can take pressure, but when you amputate it it’s gone. When I think about wha happened to me it’s like I’m living an a dark alternate reality where unspeakably henious things define me. 

My past is all fucked, and my present is miserable. My future is not bright. I think I just wasn’t meant to be born, I think I’m mentally broken or soemthing that I cant make sense of the world. Do normal things like seek friends, eat normally, or do activities. I’m just broken. I give up…"
19058pt,Depression,2024-01-06,The wanting to be alone issue,"Hey there I am just genuinely wondering if someone could give me some inspiration on how to handle those situations.
The thing is my phases are getting a bit stronger lately (like the last couple months) and I have been having issues with how and who to spend my time with.
I am currently living with my parents and I have some lovely friends and it is important to say that I don’t drink alcohol ( also bc of meds and simple dislike).
But lately every time I see my friends or generally go out I just have this huge urge to just get drunk and wanting to get out and to be alone. 
With my parents it is just that I find it hard just normally communicating and spending long time with them and also just wanting to be alone. All parties know that I am sometimes struggling and they are doing their best in not pressuring me.
Now the thing is I always want to be alone but as long as I am at my friends or with my parents I get stuff done. I motivate myself to do at least the minimal effort for school and housework and stuff. But every time I am alone the same … happens:
My parents are out for the day and I have nothing planned with friends. And as much as I love my friends they are just not the people I could text about this and would want to ( the persons I would text are dealing with some stuff on their own and I know it always gets them down when I tell them I am not fine…)
 I should be learning for my very important exams next week- but I am basically just sitting around. 
Lots of self doubt and absolutely no motivation to do anything. My lists for the day usually work but not today.
And I am getting more and more anxious about the upcoming exams.
It’s like I always want to be alone because I think I could do so much more then but the moment everyone leaves the house it’s like as If I am crashing down. Just shutting down.
And now I am constantly thinking It would be better if someone was here. Firstly because of my own safety and secondly because I would probably get up and do stuff then.
Can anyone relate a bit to my issue?
Because this - like everything- is drowning me rn and well I just feel like it is getting worse and I will hate myself tomorrow for not getting up.
So anyone out there with some insight or inspiration for me on how to try to handle this stuff?
Thanks in regards tho
Sorry if this is a buck to read - wasn’t sure what to leave out…"
190512y,Depression,2024-01-06,Why do I need so much approval from my wife?,"I fucked up again. Even after she told me a lot last night after the party that she was so grateful I was me, thank you for being you, I just love how much fun you are with my friends, etc. 
This morning in bed as we were waking up, I asked her if she had fun last night, and then like a fucking puppy dog looking for a pat on the head, I blurted out ""I did ok last night right? I didn't upset you or embarrass you or anything did i?"" Just zero confidence, total need for approval and wanting to feel wanted. She obviously asked if I thought that she thought that, and if so why. So I said something about how the last time we went out I had upset her, and this time I was trying hard not to. Then it just got into a lot of ""no I just meant"" and insecure bqckpeddling. Then she said ""yes it was fun, I love my friends."" And that threw me because it wasn't what I had asked. Of course that escalated and we fought and I feel like once again Ive put a deeper wedge into our marriage. 

Yeah I know, I'm an idiot. Not asking for advice exactly, just wonder if this cycle of self pity, pathetic request for approval, then backpeddle and fight and then feeling shitty then self pity then need for approval etc etc etc is familiar with anyone else, and if so how did you break it? I feel like a hot piping mess and I just can't stop the constant seeking of outside approval."
1904ybi,Depression,2024-01-06,Tf is wrong with me (M18),"All my life i've been like this. Always overthinking and rewinding the bad stuff that had happened in the past and it have gotten worse since my bottom partner broke up with me. I didn't see him and avoided contact with him until 3 months after the incident when school started again and when i saw him these fucking absurd thoughts made me break my ego and go ask him for forgiveness and i told him that i need him to help me overcome these thoughts. He accepted to be friends. We were good at first but when i asked him why he is cold and doesn't want to be around me as he used to, he again started to look for excuses to end the relationship and although i tried so hard to keep him (and thats why i hate myself now cuz ive lowered myself so much) he left me again. moral of the story, move on when its over and never try to piece it back together.

 Im never going to lower myself this much in life again and ive coped with the fact that we are not made for each other but these thoughts won't go out of my head. I don't know what am i processing in my head at this point. Sometimes its about he having a better life than me and that he has alot of people around him. Othertimes its about the relationship itself and all the times i made a mistake or the fact that he easily forgot about our relationship and even, during that 1-2 month friendship period, when i asked him about some memorable moments we had when were in relationship, he wouldn't remember. But most of the times its about me rewinding the times we were arguing and i imagine myself in that situation again. Im literally cringing writing this shit. Sometimes it gets so bad that i get up and walk aggressively or i imagine beating him and it follows up with rewinding every single time i've got bullied in my life. I know how absurd it is and i logically have no tension to go back to that relationship, but its like i have some sort of masochism to hurt myself with these thoughts. I dont know why im this sensitive and emotional. I feel like im a girl at this point. is this how a man should be? 6 fucking months and i still haven't moved on. The worst part is that i have to study for an university interance exam and i have 5 months left. Studying has been hell for me, besides the subjects being hard, studying is the time that those thoughts get more intense. I can't go out more than 1-2 hours cuz of that and i don't have many friends and ive been socially awkward my whole life that also plays a role. 

Just for fucks sake tell me how do i stop these thoughts and if you have the same problem i would like to hear it. And im very thankful of anyone reading all my ramblings and trying to help me in the comments.

So I've had this problem for the last few years where I just don't feel emotions. I think a lot of people misunderstood me when I say this. I don't mean I I only feel bad emotions, I just don't feel anything. Even at times where I know I should be sad lika at a funeral or something like that I just feel nothing. Or where I know I should be happy like at Christmas or my birthday. I literally just feel numb. 

Some relevant information for help may be that I've been exposed to suicide in people I know a lot recently and also people with mental health issues.

I have no help. No one to talk to. I’ve tried therapy it’s not helping. I feel like my kids would be better off just with their dad and their whole family instead of me struggling just to get by each day. 

I have them during the week and he has them the weekend. I work all weekend (12hr shifts, nights).

After the weekend I get up and pick up my kids. 

Rinse. Repeat. 

So much is broken in this house I can’t keep up. The microwave. The stove. I can’t maintain my yard. The house is always a mess.

1903zsu,Depression,2024-01-06,Boyfriend is depressed.. please help!,"Hi friends,

I’m looking for some advice! 
My boyfriend (27m) and I (26f) moved in with each other about 6 months ago. Since then, my boyfriend’s depression seems to be getting more prominent. He has informed me that this is normal and it’s not involving me, it’s just the weather.. I have depression as well but it appears in different ways (or complete opposites to his). His results in a low (or non-existent) libido, escapism into his video games and sleeping until 1pm.
I want to support him in every way possible! Although, I’m starting to feel neglected. When we discuss it, I feel as though my feelings aren’t being taken into account. And he is reluctant to go back to therapy due to financial troubles.
any advice?"
1903pc2,Depression,2024-01-06,all i ever did was try. now that i let myself go everyone left,or everyone is just okay with letting me go. okay with lashing out at me and treating me like shit now that i have nothing to give anymore. funny how that goes. yet i’m expected to always do those things for them. i never get a thank you or reciprocated or “i’m sorry” or anything. i put myself first for the first time in my life and everyone leaves. funny
18zhf5h,Depression,2024-01-05,"Im 24, unemployed, no social life, depressed, no skills, don’t know what to do in life, no motivation","It's been 3 years now since I left my job as a welder.. I left because all that kept me staying was the money, because I had a good salary.. but I think I left that job too much late, because towards the end, I felt like a robot who was only working with a huge emptiness inside.. I was no longer spoke to anyone except my bosses to inform me about the work I had to do during the day and the majority of the time I was staying quiet, maybe because im a shy person I don’t talk that much but one thing is.. I was working alot like 40/60 hours a week.. I developed depression that consumed me without realizing it until I left.. i worked there 2 years.. and when I left, I felt joy and I felt free about not working anymore (long break).. but I haven’t worked for about 3 years now.. because I don't know what to do with my life, the welder profession no longer interests me, even if I studied 2 years for it.. so during these 3 years I tried to discover differents professions for trying to know myself better.. I took psychometric tests to try to know me more about what I like and don’t like.. but I still haven't found a profession that I could potentially like... it seems like nothing interests me and it scares me the sh** out of me for my future.. so after all these failed attempts, I just gave up.. so I started to enjoy life more.. financially back then I had no problem so everything was fine.. I took a trip in punta with my father.. but when I came back from my trip, I felt the same emptiness inside me that I had when I was working at my old job.. so I started smoking cannabis to try to forget my problems (anxiety, depression, stress, overthinking etc) and i quite like it to be honest, but now I don't smoke anymore, I only take cannabis oil.. I realized how hard life is when you become an adult, I have lost interest in everything except video games, which serves as an escape for my mind, I stay inside everyday overthinking of what i can do in life.. but now on the financial side, things are not going well and I have to find a job without knowing what to do.. the thing I know now is I want a job with less stress possible ans easy to do with good paycheck but it seem impossible.. I’m so lost…i keep asking myself, why we have to work all our life till we get old and just die at the end..I just want to live the way i want with no responsability back then when i was a kid.. but unfortunately life is built like that :(.. The only reason why i’m still here right now is because I have an incredible mother who supports me and volunteers to help me mentally and financially..she is everything for me.. So Am I the only who is lost in life and seem to don’t like any profession (job) ? Btw i just wrote this to clear my mind a bit.."

I'm an introvert so I don't really mind being alone most of the time but I won't survive living in this world, I have really severe social anxiety from trauma. Hell, I can't even go outside or go somewhere without having a panic attack so how will I even survive right? Humans have to go to work and that includes having to do social interaction. Even my own family, relatives finds me dull or boring so they don't really like talking to me. I don't know what I'm doing wrong.. should I just pretend to be someone else so they start liking me? I just wanna feel like I'm valid and appreciated. These days I've been just laying on my bed all day, no social media, no nothing. Just sleep, eat, and talk to ai characters cuz if I'm not, I just end up overthinking about how perfect other people's life is. I'm a girl and it makes it sound more pathetic and sometimes I just wanna take my own life but I'm too much of a p*ssy to do so but u know, sometimes thinking about death feels peaceful.

I think I figured because I’m not actively suicidal anymore, it had to be something like ADHD.

At the end of my appointment, the nurse said I scored a 16 which is “moderately severe depression.” 
I started crying right in front of her lol. 

I feel bad because I waited so long to get help, even after being involuntarily admitted into a psych ward, I didn’t get help because in my family we drink about it. We don’t talk to professionals.
My mom and I even go into it a little when she asked me about my day and I told her I went to talk to someone about my mental health. It hurts when you’re family isn’t supportive of you doing what’s best for yourself.

Break the damn cycle. 
I’m 26 and feel like life keeps passing me by, and I’m just stagnating. Here in my bed. 
Thankfully I have a wonderful partner who takes care of me. 
Honestly I probably wouldn’t even eat if he didn’t cook me meals. That’s how apathetic I am right now. So little motivation.

Wish me luck on these SSRI’s. I hope they work. Getting real tired of being tired. Good luck out there everyone."

1902qjf,Depression,2024-01-06,Constantly SICK because of Stress. Pls help!,"This is going to be long but I really need to vent and heal myself. Just constantly been hit with a series of traumatic events back to back and have been falling chronically SICK and I’m sick of it. 

To make it easier - I’m going to list down down whatever has happened in my life since 2018 and maybe I can have some help from all of you telling me and validating that it’s been a lot and whatever I’m feeling now ( the health issues // chronic sickness // anxiety // depression ) is a result of all these years of stress. 

A bit about my background : So I come from a well to do family where I grew up with a comfortable life. I’m also a type A go getter personality so I’ve gone to a top college and topped high school. I’ve been hardworking all my life but we come from a background where all needs were more than taken care of for generations to come. 

1) When I was in 11th grade - my dad got arrested for financial fraud - that was a BIG thing in high school but now when I look back - I don’t even know how I would have coped with that. I don’t remember that phase of my life at all. I thought I coped with it well but Ofcourse the state I am in now - 15 years later - I can see signs of how that would have impacted me and made me anxious. 

Post this, my dad got out in one month and never made it seem like we had issues again. He didn’t prepare us to tell us that we were going bankerupt. 

2) Cut to 2018, WE GO BANKERUPT. And when I mean bankerupt - it’s literally 0 money in our family of 4 in all our accounts . You can imagine the shock 

3) At the same time my best friend passed away in front of me - fully catching fire in a freak incident where it was just two of us. 

4) Suddenly my parents have no choice but to ask me for money to run the house even though they didn’t want to but they had no choice. 

5) I don’t have a problem to help out but I wasn’t prepeared and the hardworking person I am , I took up 2-3 jobs to help out. 

6) With no money in the account and with barely any help in the house - my dad takes a loan to get my older brother married and has a BIG fat wedding for him. 

7) I was dating a guy for 3 years who I end the relationship with because it was going no where and I have multiple guys meeting me over the next 3 years till ( today ) where side by side I’ve been working hard to get myself some stability financially. 

8) I’ve met about 3-4 men who have dated me for three months each - and dumped me . I feel that they’ve dumped me because of what my family has gone through and it’s really affected my self worth and self esteem .

I now feel alone and sick. 


- I’ve had a super stressful 3 years of my life and started getting constipated last year during the summer of 2022 on a two month trip to london.

I’ve never had digestion issues before this but started getting constipated and really really hard and painful poops which started bleeding. 

I have severe health anxiety so you can imagine the anxiety I got on top of all the stress I’ve been going through .

I went to my doctor and he told me it’s a fissure and it’s nothing to worry about. 

This was in 2022. I never went back to him in 2023 because he told me to stop stressing out but I get constipated every 2 - 3 months with a bit of blood. 

It’s causing me a pix of anxiety the whole day and I’m unable to get out for a single night with my friends to drink without feeling like it’ll hurt me the next day. 

I’m taking a Sena stool softener whenever I’m constipated and it helps me to go properly the next day without too much pain and no blood. 

The cycle continues where I’m fine for a month or two and the constipation and following anxiety comes back. 

I’m so scared I have stomach cancer or something but going back to the doctor again and again for reassurance is also something I can’t do. 

I just need a break now and I want to feel better. 
Not constantly sick and unwell and thinking I’m dying of cancer. I really need some mental peace and reassurance as I’ve thought I’ve had some kind of cancer all day everyday for more than a year or two and this is while I’m working really hard and trying to remove some chaos for my life. My stomach just dosent help and I keep thinking I have a severe disease. 
My blood tests were all completely normal so I don’t undersnd why my stomach just can’t behave. 

Before this stomach issue cropped up- I was extremely regular with my work outs even though stressors existed. The one thing that helped me cope. Ever since I’ve started getting constipated - I’m fatigued - can’t do anything and it’s a vicious cycle. 

I just want to be better :( 

What happened to the person I was ? I don’t know who I am.

1902k6v,Depression,2024-01-06,i don't like people anymore,"i find this so strange but I've been through so much shit lately mentally because of the breakup with my ex that I started to just cut off people from my life because I never felt like they understood or even cared about me. 
i think I even got depression because of this and everyone was just focused on their life, no one cared to ask. because of the breakup I went to therapy and she told me that I do give signs of depression which left me cold. I'm not going anymore, it's expensive and I never feel the urge to talk about my feelings.
I told my friends that and they didn't know what to say, which is alright. I've been such in a bad state of mind and no one actually understands how I am feeling.
 my friends started to notice my absence and they often told me to hangout, and not only them, just people from my ordinary life. truth is, I never feel like hanging out, neither talking about my emotions, and definitely not hearing stories about their life. I'm genuinely not curious and I only feel the need to sit alone. 
Sometimes I just want to be different because I feel so damn alone sometimes, but the thought of me sharing my emotions and feelings to someone give me so much anxiety. I want to be helped, I always feel like no one genuinely would care if I told them.
today I got invited to my friends house to tell them what's been going on in my life lately. and not I feel like not going anymore. I can just imagine them just saying: ""im so sorry"" then talk about their wonderful lives.
I'm not expecting much, I just want one person that can be there for me always."

For the first bit, I attempted suicide by taking too many prescribed pills to me that i didn’t remember were for but it just lead to a bad stomachache. Now i’ve been having more thoughts but i haven’t thought a way to do it that doesn’t scare me. i’ve been feeling so empty and hollow lately i just can handle it anymore and the new year isn’t helping either. i feel like i’ll never accomplish anything of value to anyone. i was going to talk to an adult through a local support app but i feel like i’ll get sent to a psych ward. i’m not opposed because i’m afraid of what i’m going to do to myself but i’ve heard it’s so bad you leave worse than you came in and that scares me. before you tell me to talk to my parents they throw it off and forget about it when i open up about how i’m feeling (not suicidal thoughts because i’m scared they will be mad at me because my dad says suicide is stupid and selfish.)  i’ve tried coping mechanisms. family doesn’t work. fake friends don’t work. hobbies don’t work. and my family isn’t abusive either don’t get me wrong but they can’t help me because they don’t know what it’s like no matter how much they use their childhood to relate to me it’s just not the same as it was in the eighties. i’ve tried distracting myself with video games or tv or tiktok or anything i could distract myself with and it doesn’t work forever. i just don’t know what to do anymore. i’m looking for any advice i can get."

1901kpg,Depression,2024-01-06,I don't want to exist today,"Hello, I want to express how I've been feeling, but no words are coming out of my mouth. I wish my social anxiety and depression didn't exist. I feel alone, and I honestly wish I could disappear. I feel a strong urge to hurt myself today. I'm typing this quite late at night, and I recently entered my mid-20s.

My depression has been getting worse lately, but I've been trying my best to deal with my life and stay motivated. However, there is always someone, particularly supposed to be close to me and a lot older, who always ruins my mood and motivation, causing it to go back to zero. I wish to fix that, but I don't know how, and it feels like I deserve to be like this.

Another thing is, I was expressing my social anxiety to them today. Instead of being supportive, they screamed at me for being immature and told me not to cry, even though I wasn't really crying on purpose. All I wanted was a supportive and understanding person, someone who has raised me ever since I was born. I regret trying to be expressive and brave. I've been trying my best not to let social anxiety get to me, but yeah.

I wish to cry, but I don't have my own safe space to cry since they don't mind their business. Anyway, that's all I wanted to vent, and I don't know... I just need some help, maybe advice and comfort that I'm not alone.

I feel like I am the same old me even though I've been trying my best, but really... I wish I could just disappear."

19018cx,Depression,2024-01-06,I'm not quite sure what I'm going through is major depression.,"Like the title says, I'm not sure if I have major depression. Everyday, I'm able to get out of bed, and go to work. I actually enjoy my job, because it gives me a purpose. 

Normally when I get home, I'll take a shower, and then sit on my bed for the rest of the day. It's like I'm locked to my bed not able to move. There will be feelings of self doubt, loneliness and sadness. 

I don't have a single friend, and  hardly have motivation to see My family. On the weekends, I'll get severely down. Truly it's from not having a purpose, or any hobbies. But I have no way to push myself into creating things to do. 

On long 4 day weekends from work, nothing will get done. I'll normally sit around day in and day out, taking naps to pass the time. I used to have plenty of hobbies, and enjoy the weekends. Now I hate them with a passion.

If only there was a way to practice self discipline effectively. I've tried so many times. 

I truly feel like most of the these issues stem from social media use, and smart phones. They are so captivating, and extremely effective at holding our Attention. I'm not able to put it down and do things. I feel like they fry our dopamine receptor, causing extreme anhedonia.

I'm fat, I have hirsutism, problems with acne all over my body, stretch marks, cellulite, dark spots in certain areas, 40% of my hair is already white

my house is hell, my family is made up of the worst people, they disgust me. I wanted to see them all dead, so they would stop torturing me. I don't have a job so I have no way out of this hell. But I can't stand being here anymore

Not even my psychologist pretends to care. Every time I'm in crisis, when I say I'm going to kill myself, she just ignores me. She thinks I don't have the courage.

Even though I applied for several job openings, no one called me and when the results of the entrance exam come out and my parents see that I failed, they will want to force me to study. I'd rather get shot in the forehead than continue living this hell, especially because my dream of leaving here and starting a family with this celebrity I love is impossible. I've been dead inside for years. Why shouldn't I end this agony, why not kill myself and finally have peace?

The only condition I had to continue living in 2024 was if my parents helped me leave this country, and that way I could work with books in the USA or Europe. But they refused to help, which means that if I continue to live I will remain stuck here, studying what I don't want and eventually working on what I don't want.

I just want this to end, no one is going to help me get out of here or give me books (in my country they are extremely expensive and I can't afford them) so I have nothing to live for anyway"

18zzdwd,Depression,2024-01-06,How to Explain Depression to Someone Who Doesn't Get It?,"I would like to preface all of this by saying my boyfriend (36M) was very respectful during this entire conversation and was genuinely trying to be helpful, but he just doesn't understand.

My BIL is diagnosed with depression, even though he has seemingly a ""perfect life"". A beautiful wife, an adorable son, a good job he likes, their own house, no debt apart from the house, true friends, etc. etc.

Because of this, when I told my boyfriend that he has depression his response was ""But he doesn't have anything to be depressed about"" 

I tried explaining to him the difference between sadness and depression and that sadness is usually caused by something (growing apart from a friend, a breakup, etc.) while depression isn't necessarily caused by anything and has a lot more to do with your brain literally misfunctioning on you.

He then goes on to say that he went through a time when he was younger where he felt useless, like a burden, like there was no point to life, but them someone told him to always smile and he did and now he's a very happy guy.

I tried telling him that what he was experiencing probably wasn't depression, but he kept saying ""you don't know that"" and truthfully, I guess I don't for sure, but if it really was that easy to just ""turn the frown upside down"", then I'm pretty sure it wasn't depression.

Anyways, he never directly said it, but it seemed like he was trying to tell me that my BIL should just ""be happy"", but after some discussion he kind of backtracked and said, ""I wasn't giving advice, I was just telling you what happened to me"", so I wasn't really sure how to respond to that and just changed the subject.

If this comes up again, is there a better way I can explain this to him to help him understand? He's never rude to my BIL and he would never say anything like this to his face. He simply just doesn't get it."

18zz82m,Depression,2024-01-06,I just want to scream,"I am so lonely I am so lonely I am so lonely. I am going to die one day of insanity and my isolation will be the cause. I’m going to be un-cherished and unknown. I want this existence on this rock to be no more than a blip of a passing moment in space time because any longer would be cruelty by God. I am so scared of living. 

I remember the acceptance I felt in falling apart. Specifically when my body started to fall apart with me. The same body that attracts all of this evil and serves to trap me in chronic pain. The same body I love to hate and wish someone loved but not more than me. I’m such an idiot. 

I miss that feeling of being completely out of consciousness out of momentary existence. I left my body on its own and the person who said they loved me watched carelessly as I went in and out of a delirious, indiscernible rambling. I could have died. But I didn’t. What a waste, honestly.

I woke up alone but I was not okay. I went out with my parents and they didn’t clock a thing. I mean how could they? They hadn’t seen me in weeks. As far as they knew I was simply sick and in pain, again… and if I could redo the moment my chest started to swell with heat and pressure, when I was weak and swore I could hear my heart pause every other beat… I wouldn’t say a thing. I wouldn’t tell anyone anything. Not what I took and definitely not what was happening. 

I would let things run their course, and maybe I would still be where I am today but oh man do I wish I had at least given it a thorough go. I was afraid of death then. Afterwards, not so much. And you know this is why I can’t have friends. It was bad enough having depression as a kid, but now all of my latest past experiences are just… dark and twisted. I used to be a person. I used to be real and earnest with life. 

If I ever attempt again then it will be earnest, I hope. More real than the pre programmed desperation to live that oh so quickly gave way to peace. Peace that I ripped away from myself. Ugh. I am betraying my progress just by typing this shit. But I wouldnt be me without these shitty thoughts"

I love him too death and he's my best friend.

18zxak1,Depression,2024-01-06,Never been more alone,"i’m a male, i’m 17, i turn 18 in a few weeks. trying to not think about it even tho it’s all i can think about and it’s all i’ll be thinking about until then. I can’t process it. I can’t sleep. I feel so shitty. I’m graduated cuz i’ve done online school and i’m ahead. Never had any friends through high school. Had 2 friends who lived very far away, we hardly talk anymore. I’ve never had a girlfriend, ever. I need someone, i’m not someone who does well alone, i’m one of those people who’s really weird i’m like good at commitment i’m loyal, i’m wholesome i love truly and all. I need someone to love it’s just what feels right to me. I need someone to be my focus to be my purpose, to be by my side. In august of last year i met a girl, she was absolutely amazing, beautiful, kind, everything, we hungout and she hugged me, for like 5 minutes, it was so intimate and wholesome, we just talk and hugged outside at a park haha. We went back to my house and sat close to eachother put on some random show, she held my hand which I had never ever done before, and she knew that. And then she fell asleep on me, and it was so nice, that closeness with another person. It was the best feeling i’ve ever had in my whole existence, that closeness, that care. I wish i could have it everyday. But anyways, after that day everything was great, and for a few weeks it was great, and then one day out of nowhere she stopped talking completely, days went by and i was so worried, and she came back after i practically begged for an explanation, she just gave me the “i just don’t like you like that anymore”. And that was it. The pain has been absolutely unbearable from then, trying to meet new people and not getting anywhere. Then the holidays came around which i was dreading, because i always hoped we would spend them together. I went to a christmas party with my family at my moms friends house, and i met a girl, and we hit it off instantly, which was weird, i never experienced anything like it i got her number and she seemed to really like me. We went home and were instantly talking constantly, we started calling almost everyday and being so obvious with eachother, i thought this was finally it. She had a new year’s party with her family on new years so she invited me and i was really nervous but i went. And when i got there, she wasn’t there. and i was like “wait huh” and everyone was kinda just like “oh she left to go to another party.” So there i was in a house full of people i don’t know fkn ghosted irl. I had like texted her the second i got to her house and she just left me on read. No “sorry” no nothing. I went home and just cried. got drunk and passed out didn’t even see midnight. Just another new years alone. The next few days she texted me here and there like nothing happened so i yk kinda just forgave and forget but it’s left me with the past few days where there’s nothing again. I’ve been fucked over so many times it’s absolutely unreal. I’m so sad. so so sad. I’m scared, i’m stressed out, i’m so alone. I don’t even know what the point of sharing this is because i know it means nothing and it does nothing. I’m wishing on a shooting star but i’m just lost. i don’t get reality. I don’t get why people are so wicked. I need my someone. I would get married tomorrow if the right person was here. I need someone forever. I used to have hope that i would find them. Now, I think i’m just going to burn alone for as long as this miserable existence goes for."

It still confuses me how others don’t feel the same way as I do. Unfortunately I know it’s not normal to hate yourself every time you glance in a mirror or survive another day without wanting to finish it.

I use sh as a punishment because I have a logic (which I know isn’t good at all but I can’t escape it) Meaning if I hurt someone, I have to hurt myself. That means grabbing the scissors and c4tt!ng myself. I want it to stop so I’ve made it a goal of mine to stay clean for a year. It’s already so hard and it’s only 6 days into 2024.

18zwxfq,Depression,2024-01-06,Depression of futures past?,"(Yes that’s an x-men reference but hear me out). I know I have depression but it’s weird. It manifests itself by seeing myself in the future reflecting on the past. I know it sounds stoopid but my thoughts are of me reflecting on the death of a loved one whom is not dead yet. For example: it’s 3am, I’m at work drawing blood from a patient when the vivid image of me mourning the life of my 9 year old son whom passed away from an anurysm caused by a seizure (he has a history of seizures). In my mind I’m consoling myself saying things like “he had a good life, he was happy, he was a great kid”, when I know he’s alive and well sleeping in his room comfortably waiting to live another day. 
Just venting but also curious if this happens to other people too."
18zws32,Depression,2024-01-06,Sad,"For the last 3-4 years, maybe even before then, I’ve just been extremely sad. That’s it. That’s all. It’s like one thing after another and I’m sure there’s logical reasons but I just wish I wasn’t me. I wish I didn’t grow up the way I did. Or see the things I’ve seen. Or develop into those same family traits. I am not a good person, and when I try to be, something bad always happens. I may be addicted to being sad because I have been conditioned to be. 

I can’t lean on my spirituality bc that has been taken from me too (it’s a long story). I’ve done stupid shit in my life and not being able to turn to my traditional ways really makes me feel like a lost balloon. Floating about with no purpose. 

This page makes me feel not alone, and that’s great for a moment. Idk, I just hope to find some peace soon."
18zwko4,Depression,2024-01-06,I think anxiety ruined me.,"
The last more than half a year I’ve been dealing with these unique symptoms and I thought my life was js starting I’m 15 years old I js turned 15 in November btw I’m a male  and I feel like I’m too young to be feeling like this so when I was 14 and I could do everything I want basically I didn’t feel depressed had anxiety anything I felt js fine. But then I tried weed and vaping and dabs for a couple months and the weed had a good feeling and I would do it everyday if I had a chance. I had my first panic attack when I was high at the park with my friends they was passing around a blunt and a joint and I took so many hits off of that and then I felt paranoid so I called my mom and when she picked me up I was freaking out in the car my face was pale it looked like I had eyebags and my heart was racing I thought I was gonna die… but when it wore off I felt fine so I kept doing weed. But even since then it didn’t feel the same and everytime I would try it my heart would beat irregular one time i was tryna smoke after that event happened and I was feeling my chest and I didn’t feel my heart beating and I felt weird so I stood up and I was panicking so bad I thought I was also gonna die. And I had one more bad panic attack I hit a disposal ik it’s stupid after that happened but I did and ofc I had another panic attack everything around me was spinning and my mom say me in the cold shower so my heart would stop beating hard and I was so shaky. I stop doing weed after this it was to much after that. But after that all that I noticed that I was lightheaded and I couldn’t help rlly do yard work and my mind js felt blurry and out of no where my heart would race I told my mother abt this and he took me to the hospital it turned out I was really dehydrated my pee was brown but I got iv fluids and sat there and after that I felt like my normal self a little bit… I wasn’t focusing on my heart as much cuz I felt better and I felt good enough my friend peer pressured me into try weed again and I did “worst thing I did” I only hit 4 hits off this joint and my tolerance was really low and instantly everything was into slow motion and my heart was racing and I couldn’t think I was walking around my house like a freak because I didn’t know what to do and I couldn’t think. But nothing major happened I js went inside my house and I sat till it wore off I was js feeling my heart. After that again I didn’t rlly try again until the end of summer my mom sent me to my uncles 3 hours away from everyone that I know and I couldn’t see my gf or anything so I was real sad at the time and bored so I would try weed again because my uncle had some I would take little hits here and there nothing much I didn’t freak out rlly but I js decided to actually stop this time because it wasn’t doing anything. And all of the sudden sitting in my room when I was Sobor my brain/head would js feel weird it’s hard to explain it my mind would js go into panic or I felt like something real bad is gonna happen and I would freak out so bad so I would run down

To my uncles and tell him but he said I was fine and it would happen even when I was with him and I never experienced derelization before until that moment and I still experience it. And I would have many of these episodes when I was with my uncle it got so bad I seen the lower of my neck throbbing because my pulse was so fast.. I would develop these weird symptoms that think I was abt to die or I’m dying like panicking when I stood up and randomly panicking. This is also where I developed cardiohopa where I thought abt everything a matter with my heart I would search things up on google thinking bad things. After all this I js felt like nothing seems as real everything I look at is js numbing and I can’t even think sometimes I js focus on my heart rate and breathing and it freaks me out.

To save my life I feel like my mind is js empty and I’m js spectating and talking through my body when I’m with people I will look at them and I can’t think what to say or what they say it js doesn’t seem real. and my mood has been down ever since. I can’t even walk anywhere anymore without thinking I might js collapse on the floor or I have a panic attack and it will feel like I’ll stop breathing but I think this happens because I feel like I’m not fully there so I go into panic because I feel like I’m not real and outside my body. And I’ll have to stop and look at my hands and the ground like if I’m even alive. Things gotten so bad out of no where I created a note 2 months ago explaining all my symptoms. And I’m always so mean. And Also I recently discovered that I have a condition called CholinergicUrticaria that came out of no where it’s where my body breaks out in severe pain when I get hot or exercise. It goes away if I put cold water on me or go into a cold area but it only makes the systoles go away for a little bit. I still feel like little bugs are biting me even though when I’m cold.  I still feel like little bugs are biting me even though when I’m cold.

To everyone now… 
And btw I’ve been too doctors and they have said I’m js fine I’ve been checked out 5 times at 5 different places and they said I am fine. They js gave me anxiety medication but this feels like more than anxiety. Is this all js mental? It won’t ever go away. Will I break out of this cycle I want my old life back. I feel like no body compares to me.. or thinks like me I js wanna be normal is this apart of growing up am I js weak?.. it seems like I’m venting my whole life on here but I have no one that relates to me and they js tell me I’m fine"

Everything I say anywhere online leads to me being downvoted, and bombarded with hateful comments, coming from uncivilized people.

I can’t go a single day without seeing some post online where someone praises an idea that will, in the end, hurt them more than they think it will.

People of white skin have been thought of as literal *rats* in comparison to another section of America’s citizens.

I’ve seen men who’ve killed themselves because they never felt loved. And not just men. Boys around my age, too. A woman would shove a man down if he were under a certain height, or if they didn’t meet certain expectations. 

I’ve seen thousands of them. The voices never stop. They ring out, and ring out loud."

Riding my motorcycle was the one part of my day that I really looked forward to. If you ride you know, as soon as that helmet goes on, your world is suddenly so quiet. Truly one of those moments where nothing else matters, as cliche as that sounds. Can’t ride for the foreseeable future and man does this suck. 

I find myself crying randomly and I’m not really sure why. When I’m home, I find myself staring at a blank monitor, thinking about nothing.

We have so much rules, so much ways you have to behave when you are young you just lose who you really were.
Everyone has an opinion about life, about how to succeed and how to live it properly, who to love, who to hate, and if you don't think like everyone think you are a sociopath. It just make me sick, everybody makes me sick.
I lost who i really was, and everyday I try harder to find myself, because I can't find happiness while all I do is pretending to be someone I'm not.

As an example, I hate people who FCK around, boys or girls, because I grew up in a family where I learned that love is only between 2 people, and that the ones who just fck everyone are dumbasses who won't do anything with their life.
I'm so sick of it, if my gf had a lot of guys before me I feel bad because I havee very little love for myself and low esteem.
I'm just miserable in a world of corruption where nothing is fair.
I want to be free , from the thoughts of others, free from people's, and free from this world

How can I do ?"

I received an eviction notice today and my legs have been shaking a bit for the last few hours. The thought of me losing my cats, the thought of me being homeless….

But I still feel fucking stupid for saving, investing, and taking interviews. But it is wired in me to keep going up until I have all the resources I need to stop.

Suicide should be legalized for any reason. I’m literally willing to die on this hill.

Home town was shitty and full of hicks. My family and my families friends are just ethnic hicks. I would rather blow my brains out, than live my life just knowing they benefitted off of lying to me for years.

So that’s what I’m going to do.

I was about 17 years old when I broke down and I don't know if I'll ever recover. I'm still very bruised and my self-esteem is nonexistent. I miss being my 17-year-old self who was looking forward to life and what it would hold. I miss fantasizing about my life with friends and partners. To studying something I love and sleeping in peace. My brain doesn't seem to work as well as it did back then, I'm not as strong or chipper. 

That year my self-esteem was breakdown. The people responsible for it never apologized and even still justify it. I'm currently in college and seemingly getting better each day. But I still feel like a giant loser. I could get a master's tomorrow and still feel like a loser. I miss the 17-year-old who was chipper about life. If I didn't have my breakdown, I would probably be laying next to my partner and cat right now instead of being here in pain."

I used to love a girl back then, i still love her but i literally have forgotten her. We had a relationship of 5 years and now we dont talk anymore. I was fine i didn't used to miss her that much but after taking lexapro 20mg, one night a got a dream about our past, about the time we were together. It was so nostalgic and such a great memory.
And after that, i just cant stop thinking about her. I know She has her own life and she is happy with someone else. I also messaged her yesterday cuz i cant control anymore and asked her lets be together again but she said she don't want to get back together. But i am staying here crying thinking about her.

18ztuhj,Depression,2024-01-06,Should I self medicate?,"I've had depression for about 15 years now, most of it has been highly functioning but since end of 2022 it has declined a lot. It has never gotten to the point of not getting out of bed completely, but some other aspects of my life have been greatly affected, such as personal hygiene, I haven't been able to work more than a couple weeks/days before quitting, can't find motivation to do anything, constantly thinking of suicide and I feel absolutely tired all the time (I have experienced these symptoms before but never to the extent that I have now, and being able to function and work, helped keeping me distracted).

When Im not tired, Im on edge and tend to explode over the stupidest things. Last year was the worst by far. There are many factors affecting me besides my own mental health, and I simply cannot afford to go to therapy or any kind of doctor. We are absolutely broke and I NEED to get a job to provide for my family and myself, plus I cannot stay stuck in this hole forever, but to be honest, part of me doesn't want to do anything about it, nor cares.

I have tried using apps for self help, gotten into hobbies and whatnot but in the end nothing has really helped beyond keeping my mind bussy for a few minutes. 

I have a bottle of prozac in my house (my father had it, never used it and now its just there) and I was thinking that maybe taking it might help. I had lexapro prescribed about 10 years ago, had it for a good 2 months and stopped taking it because it gave me too many bad side effects, so Im sort of familiar with medication. I also had prozac before as well, I took that for longer and worked mostly ok, but I didn't liked the ""artificial"" happiness it made me feel, so I stopped. I don't care much for side effects, I just need something to get me off my feet and help me somewhat energized to start looking for a job, and actually keeping it.

I'm at the end of my rope and I can truly feel that if I don't start doing something, I'm gonna get too far gone, so what can I loose with medication, right?

Any tips on how to get started or experiences anyone else might have had? Thanks in advance"

18ztkxh,Depression,2024-01-06,"I feel exhausted being the ""leader""","I am a single mother
Sister to an alcoholic brother
Daughter to a mother that tolerates me
Mother to a child with ptsd
Partner to someone who is unmotivated

I am tired, I am poor and I can't get out of here.
 I live with my brother who drinks. Leaves him incapacitated. 3 floor house with no help. 

My mother doesn't have to tell me she doesn't like me. She was on video call with my sister, comments on my outfit without acknowledging me. Then I said ""hey that's pretty rude let's start this over, hi how are you?""
You know what she said? 
""This is why I don't like speaking to you... Anyway""
(then proceeds to continue her conversation with my sister) 

Then my poor daughter. She has some PTSD, dissociation, anxious and depression symptoms. Mostly stems from trauma about her father. It has also been difficult trying to engage with her. 

And lastly there's my now ex partner. I see him destroying his life and all he wants to tell me is I am treating him like a child. We agreed to live together. Has it happened? No. No motivation on his part. 
Sometimes I think to myself how can he see me suffer? He knows that I want to leave, he knows that living here is a huge stressor of mine. he knows that with our  two incomes combined we can afford a place, but he chooses not to. 4 years. Last night I dumped him. I'm over it. 

And throughout this all I need to keep my head up since I have many that rely on me. I am so tired. At times I wish someone had me committed. Just so I can have some peace. 

I will never find a partner. But I wish I found one who can be the leader. He will plan out the meals, he will cook, he can plan night outs. Daughter wants a ride to school? Don't worry babe keep sleeping I'll take her. 
I work full time I go to school full time. I did that so we can accelerate our future. With a new degree, new promotion, new income. 

Nobody ever thinks of me. Ever. 
But im somehow always thinking of others."

The reason why I made this is because a 13 year old has become famous all over social media because he recently beat Tetris (I'm sure you've all heard). While I am extremely happy for him it kind of makes me hate myself for not accomplishing anything important at 13 like he did (I'm only 3 years his senior). I remember when there was a time when I was the youngest person in a group, now so much time has passed that we're all starting to see people who are younger than me. And at that, more successful than I was at their age, or possibly will ever be. Sometimes I just wish I could restart my existence."

18zskbi,Depression,2024-01-06,Finally Hit My Limit,"Finally Hit my Limit

I can't say I'm particularly a depressed person. 
I'm seen as the office clown, I'm loved my my few friends and my family. 
I have a 1.5 year old son and a fiancé who's decent to me. 

Just recently bought a house exactly a year ago 01/20/2023. My very own house. First one too. 

However to get this house I had to sacrifice a lot, I'm 30, have a decent paying job but am struggling to make ends meet, living paycheck to paycheck because of the cripling debt. Tapping into my overdraft protection every paycheck to just feed myself, sometimes skipping meals to feed my son and make sure he has everything he needs to be happy and healthy. 

I had just worked months of overtime, sometimes surpassing 20 hours of OT on top of my 40 regular hours just to get ahead. 

Literally just told my mother I was so happy and proud of myself to have not needed to tap into my overdraft protection and actually live comfortably for the next two weeks, not nervously checking my bank account every hour. 

Well this evening I came home to a letter from the IRS saying I owe 2200, an amount of money I won't ever be able to pay off at this rate. 

And to even break even and survive I'd have to work nearly 80 hours a week (40 ot) just to survive.

I find myself telling my son ""not now buddy"" because I have to push out these emails and projects on time, every waking moment spent working. 

I'm waking up seeing my son and watching him grow up but it's like watching a movie and skipping the first couple acts. I'm missing so much. And when I'm not working I'm spending every ounce of energy to play with him and try to be a good father. 

That letter in the mail basically ended it. I have a life insurance policy on myself that's been in place since I was two (thanks dad). 

And all of this debt, all of this endless fucking mysery will just be gone. And the only thing keeping me here is my son. But the moment I ever fail to feed him, the moment I fail as a father I'm ending it. 

He's young enough to not remember me, call me selfish, but my life insurance policy would guarantee him not having to work a day in his life. (I work in the insurance agency as a broker, I made sure of it)

Wage slave life isn't a life worth living.

I'm so tired."

I was hesitant to wear shorts or a crop top because I was concerned that the stretch marks would be visible. I tried a variety of remedies to get rid of them or make them less noticeable, but none of them seemed to be effective. I wouldn't be as insecure if I only had a few, but I have a lot of them, and they are all over my body.

I could’ve been a doctor like my friends, or even a teacher like my mom, or a physical therapist or hairdresser like my sisters, but the only thing I’m good at is being a bum. A nuisance. A nobody. A plague. A moron. An imbecile. A waste of space. Utter uselessness. Nothing. Not even insults are good enough for me. Everyone that tries to be nice to me always says that “it gets better” or “you gotta find your own happiness,” but no one ever realizes that some people aren’t meant to be happy. Nothing I could do right now could make everyone’s suffering any better unless I leave. Too scared to live, too pussy to die. There’s no place in the world for worthless scum like me.

(To that end, it would have been far better if I went through with it years and years ago before she was conceived, and before I met my wife and made her life worse by having me in it.)

But every time I have that thought, I then wonder why I just casually think this way while other people don't, people who have such worst life situations than me, so much more hardship and so much more toil. It's not to say I have had a cushy life, but there are still so many who have had it so much worse, and yet they don't give themselves the Colt retirement every day. It must be because I'm so weak, and really if I'm thinking I should die then that proves that I'm not mentally strong enough to deserve to live. It's a self-feeding cycle that just takes hold of me, and I just want it to end. At this point i feel indifferent whether it ends with me becoming a healthier person or dead, and the latter is a lot more likely and faster than the former."

18zr7dl,Depression,2024-01-06,How do I get my partner to understand they're worth the time and effort that they put into themselves and I put into them?,"Will delete if not allowed. My partner just really needs some outside perspective, I think, because no amount of encouragement from me seems to get them to feel all that better. I understand depression is chronic and not at all a simple solution, but I figured having third parties outside of their life might get them to understand different perspectives, or people in their shoes. 


They've gone through a lot in life with basically no support, and they're in their 20s just now trying to figure out what to do with themselves, apply for financial aid and government aid, and just having a really hard time because of bureaucracy. Also because they've been convinced by their family that they're a burden, when they're really not, they just haven't had proper support systems in place. 

They've been in hospitals and pysch wards and things and I don't have direct experience with that myself, but I know things can and do get better. Would appreciate any advice or encouragement people here have to offer."

18zqilh,Depression,2024-01-06,My boyfriend doesn’t believe he has depression and chewing tobacco is the root of everything,"A little bit of context here:
Me (22F) and my boyfriend (25M) have been together for a year now. He is an amazing guy who is very smart and funny and passionate and just someone I love so so much and want to help so badly. 

Ever since I have met him he’s been a rather neurotic person who deals with a lot of inner sadness and lack of motivation. He has been stuck in a loop for a long time of working overnight in a restaurant , then sleeping all day just to work again. I stay overnight at his house on the two nights that we’re both off. We like to just hangout and order food, watch movies, play video games, stuff like that and he says he enjoys it. But besides that, he doesn’t really have anything else to look forward to in life. It seems as though this cycle really brings him down but he doesn’t really have any aspirations or ambitions for the future. He’s always said that he feels the military is his only option, but he doesn’t even want to do that. He tells me that besides hanging out with me, there is nothing that he enjoys in life. He has interests like history and football and comedy but doesn’t really have any hobbies because there’s simply nothing that he enjoys as he says. He often has episodes of feeling intense sadness and emptiness and he often feels highly insecure and critical of himself. He also thinks of death sometimes. Not that I think he would actually do something to himself, and he says that he never would, but it obviously is still concerning if he idealizes these kind of thoughts.

 We’ve had some issues lately  because we’ve been together for a year now and I really want to go out sometimes like go to dinner or to the movies, but he absolutely cannot handle that. My parents also really want him to come out more as he’s only been to my house one time in the year that we’ve been together, but he feels too much anxiety and negative feelings to be comfortable around people not in his circle. I want my family to be apart of his circle but he hasn’t been around them enough for this to happen.

He knows that the way he feels isn’t how he’s supposed to feel and isn’t manageable, so he’s constantly trying to find patterns in external influences that make him feel this way. Of course it’s human nature to seek out patterns, and this is actually a good way to pinpoint issues within yourself, but I feel like the patterns that he comes up with just aren’t the actual root of the problem. I believe that he has  ongoing untreated depression as everything that he explains checks out with depression symptoms, but he believes it always has something to do with stuff like nicotine or caffeine, and at one point he believed the vitamins he was taking were making him feel this way. It seems like he’s always coming up with some new revelation as to what’s causing all of this, and the majority of the time it has to do with nicotine. He has been using chewing tobacco for years now, and he’s constantly trying different renditions of it (ex: snus, loose leaf, stokers, zyns) and each time he feels like the new rendition is a game changer in making everything better for him before he starts feeling sad and angry again and all of a suddenly it’s then the CAUSE of all of his depressive like feelings.

I don’t deny that certain things can make him feel worse and certain things can make him feel better, but he doesn’t listen to me when I say we should focus on his inner mind and go about treatment in a way that focuses on depression, as that seems to be exactly what he is dealing with.


He does the same thing to me whenever I talk to him about my  feelings and cracks it down to being because I vape or drink too much diet dr pepper or something. I just don’t know why he does this and always believes that it’s things like this being the root of everything. I really want to help him and to understand him but I am running out of words to get him to start treating this as an actual illness. I would just really like some advice on what to do here as he is very stubborn and doesn’t take me seriously a lot of the time. He also gets very angry sometimes when I try to tell him that I believe there’s more unconscious things to be focusing on saying that I understand nothing, which I agree that I don’t and really wish to understand. I really love him and want him to be happy."
18zqd5p,Depression,2024-01-06,I feel so lonely in high school,"I (16f) moved schools and came to my new school junior year. And yes I have talked to people and everything but they only wanna stay as “class” friends. No body wants to add a new friend in their group for some reason unless idk maybe I’m doing something wrong? And my close friends from my old school have been distant with me lately because I’ve noticed on their stories on instagram that they have been extremely busy with the new stuff happening at their school. I’m grateful that I have class friends and everything but it gets so dam lonely just coming home after school and just sitting by yourself everyday. I did have a friend group in my first month of school but they weren’t honestly great due to the fact we just can’t bond at all because they are more focused on getting boyfriends (literally in every single conversation we have they bring up boys boys boys) and any time I try to change the topic they give me a dry response and switch the topic back to boys. And they had a groupchat behind my back where they kept talking with themselves, no wonder why when we hung out I never understand what they are talking about. And I asked if I could join it they just kept making excuses for me not to join it. Gosh I hate them for so many reasons. And there were a couple people trying to get closer to me but they revealed their true intentions later on…And now i’m trying to find friends whilst keeping my grades high. But while I’m trying to achieve all these academic goals (I promise I am heavily focused on them) I just feel so lonely. But I guess my social skills could improve more too. If you have any social skills tips please let me know. But also I would like to know what I can do about this."
18zqd1g,Depression,2024-01-06,Slowly starting to feel depressed,"I never felt depressed but the last 3 months have probably been the worst of my life.

But WTF! Professional life is the complete opposite. I’m 42 now and work my ass off, but I have never had a job or career that has been enjoyable. I sucked at and hated school. At work I Can’t stand the ass kissers, appeasers and the capitalists. 

I’ve tried to start many businesses. They turn a profit but not enough to live on and I never brought them to scale. 

I’ve started retail/consulting/education/media businesses. They have never worked out. I have a CDL, paid the bills but hours were long and boring. I have masters in education. Currently a teacher and hate it. 

Everyday I think about driving into an coming semi truck on my way to work. The apathy and numbness are paralyzing. Work is a huge part of my waking hours and it’s a miserable experience. 

I’m extremely sensitive to the pain. How are more people not driven to suicidal ideation living in this working hell?

If only I could be lucky enough to come up woth $2.5 million USD and buy 10-year treasury notes and live off the interst I’d be the happiest man alive."

This is probably a super cliche teenage girl thing but accompanied by mental illness having my first love and that relationship ending has really taken a toll on me. I’ve never been the type girl to really care about guys like this and I find myself often crying over the thought of him and regularly harming myself or thinking of suicide. Again this isn’t my first rodeo with depression but it’s never been this bad or tied to another person. I’m planning on taking 100mg of my lexapro tomorrow night in hopes of some sort of effect. I don’t know exactly what I’m writing this for. Today I had texted my ex begging to try again with him, our breakup was because of something I did and that only made me hate myself even more, i don’t understand why I have to ruin everything good in my life.

Usually I don't cry a lot, but recently things have been getting so bad that everyday for the past couple of weeks I've been crying myself to sleep, praying to a god I don't even believe in that I don't wake up. I'm so far gone that my brain has made up a person that comforts me in my dreams so I don't completely lose it. As pathetic as it sounds, talking to this dream person is the only thing I have to look forward to everyday. I gave up on making real friends, online I always get ghosted and in person I always get ignored, I'm not worth anyone's time anyways. "

18zochf,Depression,2024-01-06,Will my depressed partner be better off with someone else? Depressed partner (31m) pulling away.,"Hi,

So to add context I'm 33(f) and he is 31(m). We have been together 5 years. At the start of August he lost his parent, this really impacted him as it would anyone, as a result he is depressed, this has had a significant impact on our relationship and I'd say it has changed completely. He barely says much to me anymore, we aren't intimate, he isolates himself a lot from me.

He always talks about our relationship and that it isn't okay, it's not normal and it isn't a relationship, when I reassure him about the fact I am here for him to support him in whatever way he needs he responds with but this isn't a relationship etc. however if I say just an ""ok"" or ""maybe it's best we leave us if that's the way you feel"", he says well is that what you think? And what do you mean ok? Don't you have anything else to say? Now we have only said this recently, I have and still do continue to support him in whatever way that looks like. 

He says he doesn't see things changing in our relationship, I asked why and he said because he can't see it or want it right now. 

I wonder if this is just the case with me? Would him having a fresh start with another partner be better for him?

Tl;dr: This is a genuine question, would he be more affectionate with them? Would his depression still impact a new relationship like it is ours?

I guess part of me thinks would a fresh relationship with someone who hasn't been through all of the grief and all of the depression after his parents passing be better and this almost non existent relationship due to his feelings of grief. We aren't as affectionate or the same in anyway as before and it feels like I'm constantly waiting for him to leave me."
18zob1k,Depression,2024-01-06,Buspar Melatonin revisited,"Been dealing with CPTSD 25 years, been in two in-patient facilities last year equaling a third of the year with no resolve as it deepens. Refractory to many psych meds, other due to kidney damage cannot be taken.

Out of desperation I returned to Wellbutrin XL300mg for possible temporary relief until it quits working, like the many times in the past.

Stumbled across old info on combining Buspar with Melatonin, I had been searching into interactions of Buspar with Wellbutrin, I became enlightened.

Been on Wellbutrin almost 2 weeks with minor relief, adding Buspar 30mg which helped some, adding Provigil which helps immensely making a good combination but upsetting my hypertension.

4 days now I have been on Buspar 20mg x Melatonin 3mg ER taken several hours before bed. Feels different, calmer with no anxiety, more tired which may be an interaction with the Gabapentin 600mg I take for sleep. Took a little Provigil to feel less tired, so far I like it.

So far no depression, no anxiety, no SI, no sexual side effects, somewhat tired, a little dull but overall acceptable. Was hoping for increase in motivation, but this is pretty good. Currently under severe stress from hardships, normally I should be losing it.

As those on Wellbutrin know, it’s not a good anti anxiety. Added Buspar and it helped some but still had anxiety. The melatonin which changes Buspar allowing neurogenesis was the game changer."
18zo8sg,Depression,2024-01-06,I don't know what it's like to live without depression,"I've been diagnosed with chronic depression and BPD since I was 8. My whole life has revolved around my illness. I had to grow up crying myself to sleep every single night, holding my teddy bear close to me to wipe up my tears. And I don't know how to live at all. 
I have little to no friends, and I've never really had some. Luckily, I got myself an amazing boyfriend who takes care of me as much as he can, but I stopped trying to get support from him because I know how hard it is to deal with someone who has those kind of disorders. 

Last year I went to university, thinking that studying and living alone would help me and teach me how to live on my own. After a month my mother had to come back and pick me up because I was starving myself on my bed, unable to shower, unable to cook, unable to do anything. I genuinely do not know what it's like to not feel tired. I'm always exhausted, which results in me having to stay in bed for days with nothing else but my teddy bear. I tried so many medications, I tried therapy aswell but nothing seems to work. 
I need help, and I don't know what to do. I want to wake up and have energy, i want to finish university and be able to provide for my boyfriend and I. I want to be able to take care of myself. I'm considering going to a mental hospital, but I've got no idea if that would even help. 

I came here for some support, advices, anything that could help. I don't wanna take Mt own life, I love my boyfriend too much for that, but its getting really really hard. I need some help"

I’ve started drinking way more than I ever really have, self harming again, the worst is probably the way i drive my car. Way too fast. Reckless. Its the only time i feel free. The only time my chest feels light again is when im flying at 130 down some dark lonely road blasting music and screaming until my throat hurts. Theres been times where my hand slips on the wheel or my tires catch a groove in the road and I think for a split second im about to meet my end. The feeling is bliss.

I was diagnosed with autism when i was 8 or maybe 9 and am self aware of how disabled i am, forcing me to cast myself out. My parents believe i am somehow “faking” being autistic because im not high support needs and therefore don’t deserve accommodations. The last time i felt this bad was 3 years ago and I thought it finally calmed down but it didnt and i dont know what to do. I dont have anyone to talk to and my mom is the only adult in my life i can even halfway trust about something like this and she will yell at me and be mad at me if i tell her i feel this way, when she found out that i s/h she said it was something i was doing to her and that i have nothing in my life to be so upset about and that i was a disappointment, it’s gotten to the point where I’ve wanted to hurt other people too, i begged my mom for a therapist for months and she kept saying she would get me a therapist and she never did, every day i obsess over my own and others death. Just death in general. Everyone always says it will get better and it doesn’t and it never did. The only reason i keep going is because I’m ironically also scared of death, nothings quite worth it anymore, i had to move across the country from my only friend, my school is awful, my parents are emotionally neglectful and border on hating me, all i can do is sleep and watch tv and try to distract myself from having any thoughts whatsoever.

I can’t even tell a counselor because the last time i did they immediately told my parents and suggested them to take me to a mental hospital (or just mental help i guess) as soon as possible which got me in trouble for being “ungrateful”. I dont want to grow up or just keep going with the passage of time at all, i dont even have anything to show for all the bad stuff my parents put me through, all of my memories from before a year or 2 ago are either extremely fuzzy or completely gone at this point. And the days that i do reluctantly go through are spent blasting music in my headphones and disassociating from my body so i dont have to think about how awful everything about me is and how im not getting better and something must be wrong with me. I’m not sure what im even achieving with this post. I just need help man."

18zna46,Depression,2024-01-06,"i can’t wait to die, but i’m not actively suicidal. how do i find a reason to do anything","what the topic says- i’m so over living because nothing ever feels right or good or worth doing anymore for more than like 2 days. a year ago, i was so happy and i was so excited to see where life takes me, then my boyfriend who i loved very much dumped me out of nowhere (his words somehow, not mine.), i had several people close to me die, i’ve had constant car breakdowns, i’m so sick all the time (i have covid in 2024 like wtf??), and i’m exhausted no matter how much i sleep. i can’t seem to get back on my feet before something else happens. i don’t want to meet new people because i know that i’ll get left by them, i don’t feel close to any of my friends that are left no matter how hard i try, and my family gets upset with me when they ask what’s wrong and i tell them the same fucking thing every time- i miss my ex and i would literally die or kill or anything to get to go back to last year. 

how do i find a way to want to wake up in the morning? please don’t say things like “focus on the good” or anything like that. i try and it works until the good dies or leaves or whatever. i almost wish i was able to just kill myself, but i don’t think i’d do that right either and i’m not going to do that to my mom."
18zn6as,Depression,2024-01-06,Do I have a future or is this the end?,"Pretty much as the title implies (in case you pull another message; I’m not in any immediate danger nor wish to put myself in any). It’s worth noting that I’m also on the spectrum but I’m not sure how that may or may not go in hand with any of these issues. So…I’m 20. I’m in college. I’m on winter break right now. I’m not a fan of my community school at all and not really looking forward to the new semester (it’s moreso a stepping stone for a university I hope to be admitted to later on.) Even though the workload is admittedly quite small, I can’t be immediately bothered to do any assignment that is presented to me for whatever reason, no matter its size…at least not in a reasonable timeframe. Before I know it, I have so much to do, or in some cases, I’m about to fail; in every instance, I begin breaking down. I’ll know what I objectively need to do from the very beginning and just…not do it for some reason?? Even as an illustrator who hopes to turn it into a career, I find that there are long periods of time (one of which I’m stuck in right now) in which I can’t be bothered to draw anything of any capacity, either from being burnt out from drawing regularly for mere weeks or because they don’t ALWAYS do well on social media. I actually would say I’m at an amateur level and would like to get better, and I know that requires a lot of fundamental study that would pay off massively in the end, but…I also don’t want to begin right now, either?? I mean, aside from periods spanning a few months in which I can actually be bothered to function, I find that I’ve just never really WANTED to do much of anything, really. Everything feels like a chore. I quit my job last week because a manager there would regularly lash out at me for displaying autistic traits, but right now, I somehow can’t be bothered to find a new job even in spite of every monthly expense I have at stake. I would also love to start showering and brushing my teeth regularly again, both things I’ve had issues with committing to until high school (where I would never skip showers but brushing my teeth was something I’d still have to bother myself to do, though for long periods where I wasn’t in school I’d just stop taking care of myself again) though for one year in college I was able to do those things every day. But brushing my teeth was a twice-a-day thing…then became a once-a-day thing…now I have to bother myself to do it, as do I with showering all of a sudden.


At this point I genuinely wonder what’s wrong with me. I’ve never really wanted to do anything, but even as I move into adulthood with a career path in mind, that lack of passion or even the slightest of motivation somehow has not left me and I know it’s now more than just an issue. When something does manage to motivate me, it’s merely fleeting. Because I always seem to have been this way, is this just how I’m hardwired to be for the better part of my life? Is it even possible that someday, I will be a functioning member of society who ISN’T burnt out to an ungodly end from merely functioning? I know I may have hit a brick wall (possibly for good), but I would love to hear more insight."

No explanation, just ghosted me. I've been trying to think of any reason why but I can't think of anything. It hurts so much. I haven't been sleeping, I'm crying all the time. I just don't get why she would do it. And if there is a problem between us, why can't she just tell me so we can work it out? I'm sure if she told me, and we spoke we could fix whatever is wrong.

Since 2023, I think I've masturbated a total of, 5 times? masturbation was something I viewed positively and was a happy thing for me, I'm one of the lucky few who doesn't feel post-nut clarity. but now I've been so demotivated in every aspect of my life from eating to interacting with friends to playing video games, to masturbating.

I go to school (in which im actually doing very decent in), do something I dont want to do there and come home to nothing then. I go into my room and am just alone with myself and my tech-stuff (PC, phone e.g.). After that I go to sleep and it all repeats for so long already (4-5 years). I feel so selfish for not using my time wisely but also dont know what to do with my time and how not to be so alone. I would love to do something (with friends for example) everyday but I just dont know what and with whom. Im turning 18 in a few months and I have experienced nothing in my life. Myself and others told me all the great things in life would all come by time, but I came to realize they dont. I need people around me which influence me in a good way vice versa. Being alone can be so fucking frustrating for a long period of time, because everytime you are around people under certain circumstances, just then you realize how good it is to be around people, but otherwise you know thats just temporary because you have no friends.

I hate that i allowed myself to face your wrath everyday. everyday it was something “you’re cheating” when i showed you proof i wasnt but yoju still brougbt it up. i hate you because you threatened suicide and give me suicidal thoughts cuz i couldnt escape from you. i hate the fact you texted your ex to get back at me. i hate how mean you are, i hate how im killing myself every day slowly because i dont wanna think about you anymore. i hate the fact you pressured me in doing sex stuff over the phone when i didnt want to. I hate how you would refer to me as your toy, oh and i hate you for trying to tell people that im some predator when you and i were only 2 years apart., that one was a real punch in the gut because that couldve been dangerous on my part, i love you too :) 

im not a predator, im not a cheater, i had my flaws but i was a good person to you and you took that and ruined it and ruined me. I facetime’s you-ball the time even when everyone else was asleep at 3 am. i gave you all my attention and you threw that away. you would start shit for no reason like in Roblox i would tell someone “good job” you didnt speak to me the  whole day cuz of that. you created fake accounts trying to lure me in and prove that i was cheating but i declined those cuz i didnt know them . the fact you did that proves that you know i never cheated but you were trying to get me to so you could be right. i hate that i have psychosis now l  see your face everywhere and i hate that ou gave me ptsd im never gonna be able to live happily because of that, that shit is permanent . i hate you angel and ill take that to Ky. grave sooner or later. i cant keep going on like this. i really loved  you but you hated me so now i hate you for what you did to me. I cant believe i fell in love with such a terrible person. hey thats how abusers work tho, they lure you in with kindness. i never had the issues before i have now, and i have it all on paper. and dont cry when im gone. i have officially lost the will to live and im just waiting for the right moment. i was physically abused by my dad and sexually abused by my sisters friend and you making me do sex stuff over the phone was so fucking triggering.

18zmchz,Depression,2024-01-06,ive got no hope for my future,"idek why i feel like this ive spend whole my life trying to fix whatever i can around me that affected my mental health. family was the biggest issue for me. they werent abusive towards me but were to my sister. whole my life i had huge anxiety just being inside the house bc any moment anyone could say smth that would result into a huge fight. i was always the one separating getting in btw them to break out the fight i was always there for them emotionally. 
i feel like i never got to experience being a child bc i had to be cautious at all times. they no longer fight as much as they used to. but im so exhausted from all the emotional work i had to put to improve our family’s situation that ive got no energy to do anything to improve my personal life. 
besides my family i always had my own struggles that i couldn’t share with them. im trans which mentally it affects me daily but i dont even wanna get into it bc ill just keep on talking forever(im not out to my family theyre not accepting). 
it has always been very hard for me to study even tho i got good grades whole my life im in one of the best unis in my country now but im barely passing all of my classes. i know i should put in the work to study now that i dont have anything to set me back at home but im so tired all the fucking time. it makes me wanna cry every time i try to study bc i know i want to i know i need to i know i wont get the time later in life and i know i need to study to succeed and i genuinely want to but i cannot concentrate on anything at all. 
everyone is so much better than me and i keep falling behind. i hate myself i hate the way i am the way i function i hate that i know for some my life would’ve been a dream but i just lost all my passion for life. 
ive lost all of my hope for everything theres no chance of me finding love theres no chance of me succeeding in life with the way my brain works theres no chance of me ever finding peace with my mind. 
ive felt suicidal since 9th grade i always knew i wont do it i still know i cant do it but to feel like this at all times and not being able to do anything makes me even more exhausted."

Sometimes I feel self conscious abt it , other times I don’t but listening to how well her ex is doing made me realize how well everyone around me is doing and I can’t help but feel like loser and a failure. I also feel like everyone in my life could do better without me. I’m such a finical burden on my parents, my friend always wants to go out &amp; spend money I don’t have &amp; I know my gf wishes we had more. I feel overwhelmed."
18zk8j7,Depression,2024-01-05,Dissociation and anhedonia are ruining me,"I'm in my twenties and have been in the same depressive episode for 3 years. I experience depersonalization all day and my main symptom is anhedonia. I do not recognize myself anymore and honestly feel like I'm a concept not even a person. I still have a social circle and my parents try to help in their way, but nobody is getting through to me. I've been let down so much in the past that I've just become a big cynic who can't feel anything but desperation to be honest. There is no emotional connection in my relationships because of the dissociation. I've honestly tried to not think about it as much and keep doing life, but I do not see the point of living if it doesn't get better because I do not feel any connection or feelings in general, which is crucial for humans of course.  I live on my own and aside the occasional call or visit from my parents and coffee meetups with 'friends' (who have the best intentions but just do not know or get me at all), I do not get any support and I feel severe loneliness. It's not that I have social anxiety or couldn't find a partner for example, but I just can't open up anymore like I used to, nothing feels real and to be completely honest, I could not care less about other people right now. I struggle so much that I can not even keep up with a daily structure or routine which is crucial to get out of it I know that, but I just do not feel the hope anymore. There is no one in my life expect maybe my parents a bit, that I love and trust, because I've been hurt a lot. 

I've been in therapy for 1,5 years and have been on several medications, none of which worked and I am now in a TMS treatment for 32 appointments, which is also not working. I've tried meditating for a while and trying to practice self love and stuff yadayada, but there is such a big mental block that it just doesn't get through to me.I would not end my own life but I do not want to live like this, I know I can't. I know some people love me, but I cannot stay alive for other people when I'm suffering everyday. I've been looking into euthanasia trajects and it scares me that I'm this deep into it. I really need advice on this, if someone maybe is/was in a similar situation and in remission/recovery? And especially some advice on how to have some structure or small goals in life when you feel nothing. "
18zk40j,Depression,2024-01-05,Am i depressed or just sad?,"M25. 

I feel selfish for how I feel because I should be happy, I’ve got no reason to not be happy. I’ve bought a house with my gf or 4 years, we’ve got a puppy. I really love her and we have a great relationship. I just feel so sad all the time. When I sit and think about my life it upsets me to the point of crying. I just feel like my life is going to go no where and feels pointless. 

I’ve been to therapy recently, although this wasn’t due to depression. I’m an emergency worker and I was first on scene for a pretty awful suicide. It did fuck me up for a while but I’m nearly over it, I still think about it but it’s not affecting me like it was. 

I feel selfish about how sad I am because I’ve got so many reasons to be happy. I’m not sure it’s depression? I think I might just be upset/ sad. I’ve felt like this for the past 12ish months now. I don’t know what to do."
18zjxz3,Depression,2024-01-05,Is it weird to not have friends in your 20s?,"I suppose I have always been very reserved and found it difficult to speak and relate to other people, I have suffered with social anxiety a lot which obviously makes social interactions that much more difficult. I have two people I consider as friends but I don't see or hear off them very much. Currently I have a sister and a boyfriend as the only people I see much of on a regularish basis. I speak to a fair few people on social media that I met through bumble BFF, have not met any of them in person though. I see everyone else in their 20s going to parties and having lots of social interactions with people and I don't have that and feel like I am the only one. Anyone else in my situation? It would be nice to know I'm not alone :'D"
18zjtj4,Depression,2024-01-05,A stranger suggested I might be self pitying and not depressed. This was a year ago. I'm still thinking about it,"In another sub last year I vented about my struggles with alcohol and how alcoholics are perceived. Someone suggested that alcoholics often feel sorry for themselves and I was stuck in that trap, not a person with some kind of mental illness. Now I need to say this person also identifies as an addict and I learned it's common to address mental health this way in 12 step communities, so she was not at all brushing me off or being glib, she was only interested in helping me. But I've been thinking about it ever since. 

I didn't really know what ""self pity"" entailed because I thought it involved thinking that the world was out to get you and nothing is ever your fault. But after some research I found thoughts like ""I'll never be good enough, no one likes me, I can never make things better"" are also born of this character flaw. A big trait of self pity is apparently crying out and being visible distraught emotionally to make other people rush to console you. Most of the time I hide my feelings but every few weeks I melt down in front of my partner and I realized that's exactly what I'm doing, trying to convince him I feel sad so he'll console me. Also a trait of self pity is not wanting to get help, which I don't, because I feel its hopeless. But a characteristic of real depression is apparently a strong desire to have the mental illness gone and being willing to do anything to accomplish that. 

I thought of myself as full of self HATRED- fantasies of people beating me up, unable to ever be proud of myself, so disgusted with myself that I'm awkward around others and haven't made a friend in 10 years. I don't think I was dealt a bad hand in life, but I do often wonder why is every little thing so hard for me? Anyway, turns out these are just ways of avoiding your responsibility to make your own life successful. An emotion I thought I didn't feel is the one dominating my life. I'm 30 years old and I always assumed I had depression without understanding this about myself. Embarrassing! 

I don't know that I *dont* have depression. Because sometimes it just seems... really intense. Sometimes I find myself with tears in my eyes off and on all day. Then when I'm alone I can't help but let loose these intense howls. I'll mumble and not have the energy to finish sentences. I have dreams where I'm crying literally wandering around begging for help but everyone turns away and ignores me. I've been on medication on and off for 15 years. But I have the dreadful, embarrassing feeling that I've just been a whiner and a coward. Hey look, more self pity! What a shitty trap. I respond to finding out I'm a self pitier with more self pity! Aauuuugh 🙃"
18zjp7a,Depression,2024-01-05,i’m feeling kind of sad,i wouldn’t say i really care if people don’t like me most of the time but sometimes i can’t help but think about how i don’t have any friends or a partner. i’ve tried talking to people irl and online and i either get ghosted or people drift away me and vice versa. i sometimes think that i’m the problem but i always let people know that communication and honesty are important to me in friendships and relationships and i also try to listen to how they feel so they can feel safe talking to me about anything and i make sure to remind them about both of those things. i’ve tried to be myself and that hasn’t worked and i’m sort of insecure but my confidence isn’t too bad. being so lonely all of these years has been driving me insane. i know that maybe i just haven’t found the right people/person for me but i’m actually desperate to have someone to talk to and i’m not asking for all of someone’s attention i just need a friend yk?

18zjdmu,Depression,2024-01-05,Communicational Problems:,"I don't know how long this will be, but I'll just cut to the chase. I'm 23 years old, and I've been having it the worst with communication problems that branch out to other issues from 2012 to the present. I had problems interacting with people when I attended kindergarten in France, where I was born. I would never interact with people around my age and the teachers. Whenever it came to break time, I would circle trees alone in the playground. My teacher picked up on this and asked my parents whether or not I had a disability, to which they consulted my parents that I should see a doctor for my issues, but the doctor found out that I had none. My family moved over to the UK (which is where I currently stay), and we have been moving around, but one place, West Thurrock, stuck out to me the most because the entire class and teachers at that primary school, which is now an academy, were my best friends. I am forever trapped in that mindset where life was the best at that time because there are none of the issues that I am about to explain from that time frame. And now I regret severely not taking any contact information from all those good friends that I made.  
When I moved to Barking, things changed drastically. The move would be closer to my dad's work as he is a handyman and most of his jobs come all over London. The primary school I attended in Barking was not like the one back in West Thurrock, where you would have people welcoming, but it was filled with a different society that I had to adapt to. I must have been quick enough to learn swear words when I was placed in that primary school midway through my years, during which I never made friends and chose to be alone until secondary school arrived around the corner. The teachers said, 'Secondary school is the time to improve yourself and look at things differently.' I went with that mindset, and everything was unappealing for me. I fitted in with a group of 'friends' who excluded me from everything because they assumed I was a loser who didn't have any traits like them. The traits they wanted me to have were someone to enjoy pornography, playing video games, playing certain sports like football, smoking behind the school building and doing anything that was deemed as being 'cool.'   
I don't mind whatever you like, but people hate what I like, which is drawing, watching anime, reading manga and collecting action figures. I tried showing my 'cool' side to most of these people, but they often laughed and said demoralising things I didn't want to discuss. I always get treated like the invisible man in the room as well. There was one time when a group of my 'friends' were talking about the new release of God of War. I don't play video games, but I listened to the conversation. Due to my wanting to fit in, I asked: ""So what is God of War about? What's the lore behind it?"" My 'friends' stop talking. They give me that weirded-out look and then say things like, ""That's why your parents are strict"", and keep making me feel like I am the black sheep in the group. I have never been invited to a birthday party, cinema, or any specific event, and now I don't want to experience that joy as I keep getting pushed away. Then that drove me to being alone, and it caused a lot of bullying (which I still get to this day), and this doesn't come from people around my age but people younger than me as well. I remember it was closing near to Ramadan, and I was fasting, just leaning back at the football cage, waiting to go to my English class. These kids started making kissing sounds behind me and did it a few more times to get my attention, which worked, and I tried swinging at one of the kids who seemingly made that dramatic fall before going after the teacher, saying, ""He hit me! He hit me!""  
The teacher is like, ""Come here, we're going to have a meeting with the internal exclusion"", and I have been in that situation countless times for nearly being excluded even though it's not my fault. The teachers bullied me as well and claimed that they were the victims. Where one of them said I was 'passively aggressive' because of the way I looked at them, but I was having a bad fucking day. What more can you expect? The other comment was on parents' evening when I was failing mathematics, and the teacher said, ""I see your son standing all alone like a soldier awaiting a military call."" People can be like it's funny, but it wasn't funny because I was driven alone to that point as I could not fit in with people. This kept on happening, which led to my developing an eating disorder because people would bully me whenever I ate something. They would phrase it: the way I am chewing a sandwich is the way an animal would eat it and how I cannot use cutlery. I would often starve myself and eat my food in the restroom because I didn't want people to judge the way I ate my food by commenting on how I drooled over it and such.   
This was all happening in sixth form, but the time at sixth form was more relaxed than secondary school as I would get to be around the common room. But then the teachers spoke about the university, which was the exact phrasing: the university would be a new experience to better ourselves. I was pretty shy around 2012, but I managed to break past the circle, and I am willing to give myself a chance and perhaps make some good friends, but that never happened during fresher's week. At that point, I told myself 'fuck friends' and decided to be alone once again and often got bullied around because I isolated myself away from others. I also fixated on never getting something to eat while I am outside due to the paranoia problem based on eating in public, as I stated earlier. But it turned out communication as a problem awaited around the time group work activities were involved, but the difference this time was that they were assessed, which meant you have to be open with your communication to get the work done so you will be graded.   
I tried to interact as much as I could with the people that I got partnered up with, but it didn't matter if those people were stupid or smarter than me because it's the same fucking treatment where you are the invisible man in the group. So, I tend to do the work myself and submit it on time, but in the end, I get a grade barely above the passing criteria. I argue this to my academics, who say, ""You lost marks because you didn't communicate openly with your peers"", and I'm just disgusted. University for me had been miserable because I developed poor sleep hygiene, and I felt like I was going to fucking fail due to these group work-related activities and how the academics didn't have a fucking care in the world with trying to comfort the students going through hardships in their third year. Nevertheless, I have graduated, but it's been difficult trying to get the proper job you want to do around the UK because every shitty employer at the NHS doesn't want to hire someone who meets the essential and desirable criteria as they would take someone who is a slacker. Still, I guess it's due to connections, right?  
I tried various workshops and career advice on perfecting my CV but got bland advice overall. I don't understand how people get hired for a Medical Laboratory Assistant, Medical Writer, Radiographic Assistant and much more with little qualifications, but for myself, who meets the criteria, it's like they won't hire me. I get rejections all the fucking time, and now I'm done where I don't want to pursue anything related to my degree. I am doing a shit job as a student support worker, and maybe that would be the job for now until I find something else. The UK is a fucking joke when it comes to applying for jobs because I remember applying to jobs as a Customer Service Assistant in Iceland but got rejected due to the fact my qualifications were too high and mighty for someone like them. But it's like I need money; getting money means I need to go to work. The whole job hunting or, rather, to be successful in life has made me miserable. Still, during the temporary jobs that I did at Ocado as a Personal Shopper, I would never forget how sloppy management was and how there was a policy to respect employees based on ethnicity and race. However, you still get those white people calling you 'monkey, n-word, Indian and much more', and for the record, I am not fucking Indian, but they still keep saying it.   
I tried several ways to improve my communication skills, such as going online, but it's the same fucking thing where people judge you for who you are and also ignore you like you are nothing to them at all. I go on Omegle and OmeTV to talk to people there but get called a bunch of racist shit and get comments about my appearance. I guess this is the reason why I would never get a girlfriend because nobody would want to go for someone who has a fat nose, wears glasses, looks like a monkey and has the personification of a paedophile. I get jealous whenever I see people having a good time with their friends or partners because that is not me in the picture. My parents are good people, but I don't have a good relationship with them, especially my dad, because of personal issues I don't want to talk about. I try to connect to my mom and talk about these issues whenever she notices I am upset, but she doesn't comfort me and says everything is my fault because of how I look at people and how I phrase certain words, and it pisses me off. But then again, I think I'm looking at all this differently because my parents don't understand English, and I don't understand Tamil. I have two sisters, but they don't talk much to me. We used to like anime, but they don't watch it anymore. I'm not mad about that, but we don't do anything together. My sisters think I am that boring older brother who locks himself in his room doing god knows what, but I guess I'm doing pointless shit like that. Have I tried taking my life? No, but there were considerations that I wanted to walk on the road and let some vehicle run me over. Why haven't I considered it? I don't know, but I'm sick and tired of everything in life-based on communication skills. I don't know what it means to fit in because I am someone who can't do that at all in this fucked up world. Don't ask me about therapy because that is useless when you get unreliable therapists who start saying, 'it's too late; there are people with bigger problems and much more' because I have had enough with them, and most of them don't know how to solve my problem because they think it's not depression, but I don't know. I want a better life; honestly, I'd kill having one right now. "
18zjb0y,Depression,2024-01-05,Sleeping trouble,"Hello, 

So to provide a little bit of context to my problem; I have severe anxiety and agoraphobia, so I struggle to leave the house out of fear of Panic Attacks. I currently take 40mg of fluoxetine and will take 25mg of Phenergan anytime I am panicked.

Because of my fear of leaving my comfort zone, I don’t work and I left education. I have been getting better over the past 3 years but have not made as much progress as I should have, I am well aware of my laziness and lack of motivation. 

I am 19 and lack a healthy schedule, I wake up, maybe go for a walk, work out in my garage, sit on my pc and that’s it. Because of a lack of routine my sleep schedule often becomes messy, sleeping at 7am - 5pm etc. Therefore my anxiety becomes worse whenever my sleep schedule is interrupted.

I was wondering, is there anything I can do to maintain a healthy schedule? Any vitamins? Medication? Natural fixes? 

Thanks!"

18zird2,Depression,2024-01-05,i want to ask my parents for help but i dont know how,"Hi

This is my first post on this sub so im going to go into a little bit of background and context. I (F15) have been homeschooled since fourth grade due to the amount of bullying i suffered in middle school. It led to my anxiety worsening and to suicidal thoughts at just eight. It got better, but over the years i started to spiral and it only got worse and worse with each year. I started to feel numb, being mean and distant, things i liked to do seemed boring and mundane, i didnt want to get up from bed, eat, drink, do schoolwork, *anything*. At 11, i started cutting and burning myself to feel something and developed an addiction. That, combined with suicidal thoughts, hatred for my body, numbness, an eating disorder and basically everyone seeing me as a failure led to many suicide attempts, all which failed and all which i had to hide.

Now, i feel as if i dont get help, i will just end it all. I cant take it anymore, its worse than its ever been. Im 10 days clean, but i dont know for how long, my ED is back and my everyone seems to notice how much i’ve changed. My mom has depression and anxiety, i got it from her. Shes been in therapy and on medication and i guess im kinda scared how she’ll react if she finds out about my scars and if i ask for help. I want to go on medication, see if it works but most importantly *talk to somebody other than myself*. Do you guys have *any* tips on how to start *that* kind of conversation with her? Im so scared and i just want help."

18zini3,Depression,2024-01-05,I'm convinced that overindulgence downregulating dopamine is a big cause of depression - My story,"Hi all,

I'm 26 and I live in the UK. I want to share my story in the hope that someone else can relate to this, and to get this off my chest.

I've identified the catalyst to my declining quality of life as being my first breakup in 2017. Before this I was very sociable at university, went gym regularly and had much more enjoyment from everyday things and felt unstoppable. Then after this breakup, it wasn't all bad at the start, but coincidentally from then onwards, things started to change.

I had a part time retail job over the holidays at university, I would usually do all the hours under the sun as I had the mentality of ""Why sit at home playing video games when I can earn money?"". That summer 2017, that motivation to do 80 hours a week wasn't there anymore, despite my love of stacking money.

Then I came back to university for my final year, my housemate introduced me to modafinil and I absolutely loved it. I thought ""Ahh this is the key to getting back that spark!"", however I was in denial only realising now that taking large doses I was basically just doing this for recreational reasons (It's not crack so some of you might laugh but I loved it). Then another friend introduced me to vaping in mid-2018, I loved it, and once again followed the same mindset. I couldn't do anything in moderation, so I chain vaped and took mod (all day everyday).

Then I graduated in 2018, got my first accountancy job, but got fired after a month. Reason? Apparently I wasn't understanding/picking things up quick enough and made a couple pretty bad mistakes. Truth is, I was taking high modafinil doses and going through nicotine withdrawal everyday which undoubtedly affected my performance in hindsight. This had a big knock on my confidence and self worth.

I found another job 2 weeks afterwards with no problems, but I was miserable, had existential questions everyday and just put a mask on. Then covid came and I got a new job, I passed my first accountancy exam, and as things were minorly improving, I decided to quit nicotine cold turkey.

Let me tell you, I was clean from nicotine for 3 months, and despite not being perfect, after the withdrawal I felt some pleasure again from interacting with people, work wasn't as painful anymore and I started going to the gym again. Then I relapsed at a party... stopped going to the gym and all of my good habits.

Flash forward to today. I am a Management Accountant on £36k a year, on the outside I look like I'm doing well, but it's just a mask.

I soldier through my 2 days a week in the office, I'm anxious and sweaty when talking to people unlike my confident past, I question the point of life etc. When WFH, even when I have work I often wake up before 9am, set an autoclicker to appear online, take modafinil/vape/masturbate till about 1, force myself to shower, maybe reply to 1 email, but regardless I feel exhausted - I don't know how I get away with this but it keeps me sane (whilst enabling the pit to get deeper), the piling workload and lack of motivation to do it creates panic and escapism in soft drugs, porn and instant gratification.

I see other colleagues around me qualify as accountants, yet I lack the motivation to get out of bed let alone to study. Girlfriend? Why bother when porn is there. Now on top of that I've added alcohol every couple of nights to take the edge off the stimulants in the evenings, lying to myself that it's helping me whilst feeling dreadful the next day.

My life now consisists of lying on my bed 90% of my waking day, consuming drugs and mastubating, I used to game in the past but why do that when I can just binge social media 10+ hours everyday. I have a fear of getting older, not acheiving anything and I feel that time is flying by with no progress in my life or hobbies, whilst friends are getting married, buying apartments or just in general enjoying life. I feel guilt from missed opportunities and wasted money.

This is my groundhog day for years with the low becoming lower everyday. At this point with my mental health I'm paranoid that if something happened like a family member died or I lost my job, then I would be sent straight to the depths of depression to a level where not even a mask will get me through.

Moral of my story? I hope to soon quit these habits as I had a glimpse of hopeful improvement nearly 3 years ago, I have concluded that if you constantly pound your brains pleasure centres, then you're going to naturally have a dopamine deficiency - Maybe some relatable hope for many of you?

Second lesson - I have £80k saved, I'm well travelled, an average car, pay £100 month in rent including food, spend 1/3 of my salary on junk food, vapes and alcohol, then save the rest. My mum cooks most of my food, does my washing etc. - An easy life deosn't always mean that it becomes easy, I have been enabled to persist with my lifestyle that I'm stuck in that has left me depressed, overweight and isolated in my room. I don't blame others, but please all of you, if you are in a comfortable situation, use it to better yourselves and not to mess yourselves up long term through hedonism."
18zikn3,Depression,2024-01-05,Depression and emptiness inside. Tw maybe.,"Hi, I'm a male, 33 years old, currently working 2 jobs (PC repairs on daytime, soundman at karaoke place at night). I'm on luvox, prescribed by my doctor since 2021 until now due to severe depression (lost my job, money issues due to covid 19). I took quite some time to recover economically, but my mind never did. Coupled with whole bunch of other problems (I have to move back to my parent's house, car breakdown, blown my own PC etc), I'm really in shambles.

2023 was the worst year, my girlfriend left me (probably due to my mental health or anything). I don't know how to describe the pain inside, but it's bad. Real bad. She's the only one I have (me and my parents aren't very communicative), and I still have no concrete answers why she left me. I do have a couple of friends, but I never shared anything with them. Not that I don't trust them, but I'm not the type of person who share personal problems openly. So everything is just slowly pent up inside. All the sadness, disappointment, confusion. And anger. I feel angry all the time, but why? Am I angry at myself?

At this point, I guess I'm not thinking straight anymore. I feel numb and empty and angry. I don't if it's due to the anger or anything, but I can't stand seeing the happiness of other people. I tend to cause them pain, albeit indirectly (only towards the people at my workplace, not my family and folks). I love seeing their frustration. I don't know why, but I feel satisfied. I think I became sadistic (maybe), and it doesn't feel wrong at all. At least there's a spark of happiness inside. 

Sorry for the long rambling, I'm not a good storyteller. It's up to you either to read and believe this or not, I just need for this to be written somewhere. To anybody who spend their time reading this, thank you."
18zigh8,Depression,2024-01-05,Want to die but not suicidal,"I finally found a combo of medication that has made me feel better after 7 years of deep depression.

I just wish there was a way for it to end but on a happy note.

18zi7fb,Depression,2024-01-05,"For all the folks struggling and feeling left out by the world out there, here’s something that might help","I have been through depressive episodes for the past few months. When it was bad, my whole body felt hijacked by my amygdala. Today I was on an international flight back home by myself and there’s no WiFi in flight. Hours of being lonely in the dark for sure didn’t help and when my obsessive thoughts were just about to spiral, I opened up Spotify and found out a playlist I had from a few years ago that’d been downloaded locally. I started listening and it saved my day. I remembered the old me when I was listening to those songs and it brought back so many good memories, some with friends and some with myself. I cried so hard on the plane. 

If you have an old playlist, maybe try listening to it and see if you can find any inspirations like I did. Music is such a great gift.

18zhw7i,Depression,2024-01-05,LPT: brushing teeth after dinner might feel tangibly easier,"Hello everyone,

Brushing teeth before bed has long felt like quite a chore to do, in stark contrast with the, otherwise, relaxed psychological state; even more so when you already feel tired or not up to it. 

What I have discovered recently is that moving the activity from the end of the day to immediately after the last meal or doing dishes makes it feel incredibly easier, allowing to pay actual care to the process — and go to bed right there and then or after a shower, if you feel like it, ending the day gently.

Thought it could be of use for other people in here as well, so decided to share. Have a good one!"

18zhaub,Depression,2024-01-05,Friend might be attention seeking and guilt tripping me,"So this is a weird situation, but my friend has been repeatedly telling me she is going to kill herself. then she always DMs me again acting completely normal. When I ask her if she’s ok she says “I’m not suicidal anymore because a got new medication today” which I know for a fact that is not how meds work at all. This is the third time this has happened.

Notably, the main factor behind these threats is online drama, and I feel like she is trying to guilt trip me and others by saying she is going to kill herself. She posted herself holding a knife on a server threatening suicide in the midst of some of her ex-friends coming back and confronting her, threatened suicide when she got banned from said server, and now she threatened it again with seemingly no reason. And then, like I said, back to normal with the meds excuse.

I don’t want to downplay her suicidal tendencies if this is genuine, but I have some strong doubts and want to hear some other people’s thoughts since my own experiences with suicide and depression might cloud my judgement"

18zfo37,Depression,2024-01-05,r/suicidewatch has no response and I’m desperate for advice rn,"I don’t want to die but my actions are different from my intentions 

Hi, I’m 15, not fine, dealing with mental issues for a long time, have always been holding in stuff. Though there is a lot to rant about, I’d like to ask for solutions here since I’m lost and I do not want another suicide attempt like I just did today with trying to drown myself. All this time I would just tell myself that it’s just a gig, maybe I’m just trying to get a villain origin story or whatever, but today was too far. Though my life is usually crap, I stood strong, kept a smile and going, but recently my mentality and basic facade have been breaking. I’ll vent later, back to advice that I need rn.

Background on what I need help with:
I really want help and this sort of thing won’t work with consulting my friends, they’re tough but this is not what they would be ready for nor are they responsible to deal with it.
 Last time I got therapy in a public hospital because my parents aren’t rich, the therapist and counsellor transferred me to see a psychiatrist as well, things are not looking pretty. The therapist who talked to me was skeptical about how I’d make decisions to quit some activities because I’m a pushover and I joined 13 extra-curricular activities in school. Though I did make the decision to join so much and I do several mental issues surrounding this that I will not bring up rn, it’s torture and tiring, but I do put out my best in all of them in hopes to please people and prove that I am fine. I swear if I didn’t have my calmness and resolve to negotiate that I can quit on my own, my therapist would be writing a letter to my school to force me to quit something that’s not from my free will. I currently lost that calm composure, things are looking ugly.

Current issue abt getting to said help:
-Not sure if these mental health things work the same in different regions so I’ll bring up that I’m from Hong Kong in case that gives out any extra info or things to look out on

-teenage counselling/ therapy is confidential but they would need to inform my parents when any suicidal actions or self-harming is done. I get that they want someone to monitor us , I can’t control myself in aspects of this, but I do not want my parents to know. My mom has Parkinson’s, my parents are constantly stressed already and I know that my dad is not dealing with things well. Setting boundaries with a 60-year-old is also not easy when he’s possibly as hopeless as I am but is reluctant to seek help. I’m not dying because of fear and imagining how devasted my parents would be, they would feel so even if it’s just an attempt.

-losing my control and free will is already something that I’m yelling at myself right now, people seeing me as an unreliable patient who can’t control herself would make me feel shittier 

-I am so lost , I don’t want this to happen again. I tried to soothe myself with everything, not working well. The people that I have to deal with and the state that I’m in is absolutely miserable 

-idk, it feels like people would view me as a person with no self-control if I do this 

Is there a way to seek proper help without my family/ friends knowing 
How can I feel less worse about my situation 
I feel like solving the things going on in my life would help me feel way better, but that doesn’t seem to be possible nor do I have the energy to do it anymore. I’m sick of getting stomped on when I was tough enough to help and bare with so much bs"

I draw, cook, play games, watch movies, read, study art, have sex, etc, but nothing seems to bring me that flame anymore. 

I'm a young adult, but over the last months i have noticed the second i'm done with work i either eat, sleep or play videogames. Don't have any motivation to even shower unless I'm going out, and no motivation to try new activities.

I have been having almost hourly thoughts of committing suicide, they just jump into my head, but it's mostly the part where someone finds my body and cries or whatever.

I think it speaks to a deeper desire to feel cared for and be seen. After all, nothing is as undeniably hurt as someone who is already dead.

First, My friends hate me, I know they do because one of them wrote me an angry text saying as much. I got too drunk and threw up in the tub and ruined the vibe of a christmas party with my problems. That one is on me, I guess. I never understood why they put up with me and, well, I guess they never did. I couldn't even explain why I got drunk in the first place. Some part of me just broke and I drank like there was no tomorrow. I just couldn't take it anymore. I'm sober again but I don't know for how long. They have every right to be angry which is the worst part. But man, that text is haunting me, saying they don't care that I'm lonely. They want me to get my shit together like it's something that I can choose to do. I wonder, genuinely if people would finally believe I was mentally ill if I just killed myself. What would it take you know.

Somehow, my job search also came to a screeching halt. An opportunity I was really excited for fell through in the last minute. I aced the technical interviews, I smiled and laughed, I proved I was a good fit for the company. I was their top candidate apparently. Then all of a sudden, it just falls through. Business is too slow and they can't take me at this time. There is still a chance but I know how these things go. I can't do this shit again. It's too fucking hard. It's just too hard to keep putting myself out there and getting hurt every time. Reminds me of dating honestly.

I'm just going to start pushing people away. I told myself I have to stand up for myself this year. I don't want to hurt the people around me but I just can't control it. I'm hurting something fierce and I just don't have any outlets. My family is hurt by me but they don't show it because they love me. My friends are hurt by me, some of them just straight up hate me.

Mom of three and married. This is not my first rodeo with therapy but it is my first experience being formally diagnosed if you will. I was told in the past that I was probably dealing with postpartum depression and/or anxiety (which I was) but it never felt more than them just throwing it out there as a suggestion. That was after back to back pregnancies and I know for certain that I was having postpartum depression and anxiety. The thing is, I already wasn't great before pregnancy even happened. I didn't know it at the time but it's very clear to me now. The postpartum stuff has faded for me and transformed into a long cycle of being what I thought was ""fine"" to these extreme lows every so often. After I started spiraling into one of my lowest of lows, my husband encouraged me to see someone about it. Through this experience so far, I now know I have dysthymic disorder with boughts of major depressive disorder...what he referred to as ""double depression"". He feels I've probably had this since at least my young teens. On top of that, he says I have seasonal affective disorder and generalized anxiety disorder. All of this said and explained to me out loud sounded pretty daunting. You mean, I have likely never even known normal? That's terrifying to me and also fills me with a sense of hopelessness. I see the common treatment is a combination of talk therapy and antidepressants but I have read many personal experiences so far of meds not working or helping. I'm happy to go on with therapy but the thought of trial and error with antidepressants has me anxious (surprise, surprise). I look forward to my therapy appointments but it's still new and I don't feel it's helping me improve much...or  just yet anyway. I'm still in the worst low I've ever had. I feel defeated and just utterly exhausted. I'd like to hear your personal experiences if you have them."

So in general, thanks to therapy, I'm able to keep almost every feeling in check. I can talk about my feelings, tell everybody what's going on in my mind and I can give friends deep, emotional hugs if needed. 
In the last few months I really, really often told my friends how I'm feeling and describing what's going on. 
Today is the day though where I'm not able, or better, I don't know how I should describe my feelings.
Nothing I want to say describes my feelings. I can't talk to my therapist, cause I'm tired of talking. I'm just too exhausted to talk. 
Does anybody know this feeling? How can I overcome it?"
18zd05g,Depression,2024-01-05,Quarter Life Crisis,"Hi guys! So i’m 27F. 

I’m about to take my masters and i’ve been brought up pretty privileged. Idk if i’m right or i’m overthinking but recently ive been having a crisis. I’ve seen how money and power corrupts, even within my family. I have goals I want to achieve. However, I don’t want to one day look in the mirror and not recognize myself. 

I grew up pretty sensitive and naive. I went through a phase where I did absolutely well in school but I treated others so poorly. A lot of adults told me I was going places. Then, I went down this path where I was so materialistic and shallow. I was humbled by getting into this relationship where I thought everything was going to be amazing. However, it ended absolutely traumatic and abusive. 

As I entered the workforce I became more and more confused as to who I wanted to be. I saw how koney and power corrupts and it’s damn scary. On a personal note, I even witnessed family members backstabbing each other to milk our breadwinner. 

Now that I am entering into this new chapter of my life, I’m questioning myself. Who do I really want to be? Yes, I want to be successful but at the same time I want to live life. I want to have a family and I want to have a healthy relationship with my children. 

Any advise? Or anyone out there experiencing the same thing? 

Guys, I’m so scared. I don’t want to turn into a monster on my way to my achieving my goals. I want to live a life with meaningful relationships."

18zcp0c,Depression,2024-01-05,Feeling worthless...," I amcurrently at home, age 30, having left a job where although there were friends and a good work culture, i felt like you didn't fit in due to imposter syndrome. After resigning, i secured another job in a different location, but unfortunately, they couldn't take me on due to layoffs, leaving me  jobless. This has led to feelings of worthlessness, isolation from friends, financial strain, and the inability to support my aging parents, which is weighing heavily on me. I've attempted to learn software development but struggle to focus, adding to me frustrations.

I think it is time to end all this...."
18zcnwl,Depression,2024-01-05,I'm to young I have no one for me,"I am only 12 .I know you think im just asking for attention but I don't mean kids at school bulky me im talking about my family .I think I have broken my self by undermining my trauma .
T.w (abuse ) :when I was from ages 5 to 10 as all my memory is I was abused by my sister who almost went to jail.by this I don't mean play fights she would choke me ,slap me,beat me ,threaten me and try to drown me and I only have trauma and ptsd in my brain she would also choke me till I'd say that I love her (I am 12 she is 20 ) .and my parents say that are not at fault here but they never tried to help or save me as a 5 year old what did they expect  me to do were they just at work not even wondering if I'm going to be alive when their back so from the start I have issues .
And on top of that I still have to live with them as what can I do so when anyone ask me about my family I can't say anything good and I see these happy families and I can only wish my parents loved me as much as they cherish  my psycho sister .
My sister says that it's not her fault and has never apologized for trying to kill me and I did ask her once she just cried to dad and he said I shouldn't bring up her trauma.HER TRAUMA IM GOING TO KILL MYSELF THINKING ABOUT IT .
And I do also have no fri3nds with my different personalities and realities im kind of numb to having no human connection as I don't think i have left my house in six or more months (other than school) and it feels normal and because of this when anyone wants to talk to me or take me outside I can't do it I haven't left my room once in 3 days my family does not care .
My symptoms :
I have different personalities
I get attached for approval easily 
I can't smile or even fake one anymore 
I used to be able to cry to let it out but I can't even do that anymore .
I only have trauma and can only think of my trauma 
I haven't slept in a full 2 months and I am feeling dead 

I only o8sten to music and do nothing
 
I have lost all motivation

I have downplayed my trauma from my sister so much that now if anything happens I think it's normal (I'm trying but I just feel it's normal)

I feel numb and even if I see something sad I can't express my emotions 

I'm sorry but do you think im depressed cause I don't want to do any self diagnosis like the people on tiktok and this might seem like a faze but I literally am shaking and can't feel my world and if I dont end it the universe will. Pls help me its been to long and I have dreams I don't want to die but i don't even think I'll achieve them so what's the point"
18zclfr,Depression,2024-01-05,What do I want to do when I grow up,"Nothing. I don't have any passions or dreams or goals. Whenever I sit back and think of what I want to do with/for myself... the final thought is always...to end it.
I fail at or screw up anything I try to achieve anyway. 
I can't take it anymore.  The negative self talk (stemming from childhood b.s.) won't stop. I'm stuck in a loop of negative thoughts. I don't have anyone to vent to or confide in.
I just want it to end. I'm feeling too overwhelmed and I don't know where to turn."

My dad heard it’s me, he said: why is she calling? So annoying. 

My mom said: if you feel bad, go to a doctor, go to the hospital, I’m not a doctor I can’t help. I have my own life. Stop telling me these negative things. 

I then asked my mom: you wouldn’t care even if I had cancer right? She said: you need a doctor, hire someone who can take care of you if you couldn’t yourself, there is nothing I can be of help.

18zbz8w,Depression,2024-01-05,Bed rot,"All I do is work and come home to rot in bed. 
Sometimes I actually get my “task list” (brush teeth, do dishes, etc) done, most of the time I just check a few things off and get to rotting. 
I don’t go outside, I don’t have friends, I don’t have a large support system. 
I live with my 2 dogs and a cat. I live in a high crime/dangerous area which doesn’t help with the agoraphobia. 
I also work long hours in a demanding sales job. 

Any tips to not spend my entire life in bed waiting for death?"
18zbkaf,Depression,2024-01-05,I can't do this anymore,"I feel dead. For months now I felt nothing but extreme exhaustion. For the last time I tried making new friends, search for work, maybe find a significant other, but like always I failed miserably and got tired. I am no longer functioning. I hate my life that it became this way, I feel alien because somehow I am yet to find a person who would understand me, that suffered and is suffering in a similar way to me. I am yet to find someone who ever since barely finishing school have done nothing in their lives, someone who never had a partner, never had a job, never had sex, have no hobbies, in short failing at every single aspect of life imaginable. My entire life I've been nothing but a failure. I am tired of feeling this way, I'm tired of being unable to relate to anyone and be uninteresting to everyone because my life is nothing.   


I don't feel like I even want to get better anymore. I don't want to carry this weight all my life, to carry this carcass and to be reminded of what my life could've been. I've been in this hole for so long there's nothing for me to look forward to. I don't feel nothing, everything is boring, uninteresting, even when I try I loose interest in a few days. I used to look at my future life brightly, because despite depression I was still positive that it won't be forever and I have a nice future ahead of me, but I don't feel excited about it anymore. If I got out of depression I would still be hollow   


I seriously see no other solution for me but to die. I leave my therapist's office crying because of how powerless I feel. I've tried all I could. I really tried to get out of it, but I just don't know what else I can do, I really don't. I'm so dead inside and I just don't want to anymore. I want to be normal and have a normal life "
18zbgu9,Depression,2024-01-05,everything Sucks™️,hey all. really going through it lately and needing some kind words. 24(m) and going through absolute hell and near complete social isolation. i go out at night and have a couple acquaintances here and there but nothing deep enough to be able to lean on someone. i’m estranged from my abusive mother and right now everyone in my life is trying to get me to “forgive” her and let her back into my life despite reports of her mental health and behavior spiraling since she kicked me out during a mental health episode she was having when i was around 20 years of age. i’ve never dated anyone and have always have limited friends due to being audhd and it crushes me. i’ve just been trying to focus on school and work and working out but lately i can’t outrun the void inside. i’m seeing a therapist and not in any kind of danger but every chance i get i’m crying or feel like i’m about to. this was brought on by someone that i thought i could trust asking me to reconnect with my mother and i have never felt more alone. i feel like i’m losing my whole family because of my mother and her issues and i’m so scared.
18zb46b,Depression,2024-01-05,depression or chronic fatigue?,"i’ve seen a lot of posts on this subreddit that usually discuss how depression could lead to fatigue, but i’m wondering how to differentiate between the two. 

i’ve struggled with depression for a good portion of my life. depression to me always manifested as extreme sadness and suicidal ideations. i was in therapy for years (still going), but things have been looking up for me lately. i’m definitely not as depressed but now i feel like i’m just extremely numb? i can’t seem to remember anything and any small task takes a lot out of me. if i go to the grocery store or anything, i feel like it sucks the life out of me and i’m too tired to do anything else. i also cannot form normal thoughts and my head is ALWAYS foggy, to the point it’s noticeable to those around me. i feel like everybody in my life are very functional people, and here i am getting burnt out because i went for a ten minute walk. 

depression made me actively not want to do things (like exercise, go out, live, etc.), but whatever i’m experiencing right now feels like all of these activities i genuinely want to do are being “stopped” by how constantly tired i feel.

does the way depression manifest change from extreme sadness to extreme numbness? is the fatigue a part of this or could this be some underlying medical issue that i might need to get checked out? 

any advice/similar experiences would be really helpful."

18zazao,Depression,2024-01-05,confused but better,"I've been experiencing mental health issues since February of last year. I was in a really bad place and ex forced me to be with him despite him cheating on me with one if my close friends, or else he'd cry and guilt trip me saying I would be the reason for his suicide. This really affected me as you can tell. That relationship caused me to cut contact with everyone in my life, even my family, and I still really regret it until this day. During those months, I stopped feeling anything nor any emotion. I tried to get better, I really did the most I could for a 15 year old. I tried crying it all out,but I couldn't cry. I tried doing the things I used to enjoy, but I didn't find happiness in them anymore. I used to love talking to people before this relationship, but once i was in it i became a social outcast to the point where I couldn't even talk to myself since I was so confused with what was happening to me.   I felt like I was at rock bottom since I really couldn't feel anything, but I was still optimistic enough to get better. I suspected that I had depression, but i brushed it off since I knew that there were people who have had it worse than me, so I surely couldn't be depressed. I really wanted to go to therapy but I was so scared that my parents would've gotten furious if I told them why I wanted to go or if the therapist would tell them about my problems, Especially since I wasn't allowed to date yet. When I finally ended it with him, I felt so free and happy again, after so long, but that feeling only laster for at most an hour. I've been healing from that experience for a while now and I only started doing more research on my problem during the start of 2024 since my psycology subject started getting deeper. This was when I discovered that I was actually emotionally and sexually abused by him, in addition to that, he also r*ped me. I have never wanted to experience those things in my life, but I cant change what has already happened. But for some reason, finally knowing what was wrong and why I felt like that was was just so releiving. I finally had an explanation on why I was acting so differently compared to who I was in the past years. I truly changed for the worst in 2023, I didn't even know how or why I got to where I was then, but Im making small steps on getting better. I used to be mad at myself for not getting over that relationship as fast as I expected, but speaking to more and more peoople that were willing to help, it let me realize that you dont have a time limit for getting better. My relationship just lasted 4 months yet Im spending 7 months and counting getting over it. I know my problems arent as big as others' but I just wanted to share how I can make progress, which means yoy can as well :) Things may be confusing and scary and weird, but I promise theres always a solution. You aren't ""less important"" than anyone else. Spend some time trying to talk with yourself and being your own motivation when nothing else may help. Always stay optimistic because theres always going to be n explanation and a reason to look forward to tomorrow:)"
18zaprj,Depression,2024-01-05,Why should I stay alive?,"Almost everything that makes people happy I will never have any of the things that make other people happy, and it's not me ""predicting"" the future or making assumptions, there are facts that stop what I suspect make people happy from happening to me.

18za4kw,Depression,2024-01-05,Anxiety/Depression cancel each other,"Have you ever felt like [this](https://astronomy.swin.edu.au/cms/cpg15x/albums/scaled_cache/interference.2-400x238.jpg) is your anxiety/depression? Its a fun thought ive had a while ago. I think it doesnt make sense to be anxious if you dont value your life. So i lose all of my anxiety when i get worse. When at the peak of depression i realize that im not scared of going out and i need to get out of the depressive state, so i do when i find the motivation. This helps with the depression because you feel powerful, feel like you have all the doors open to do what you want. But as typur will to live returns so does your anxiety, you need a new reason to not be anxious and cant find one or realize too late that its already taken control. At the peak of anxiety you still feel the fruit of your labor when you battled out of the depressive state but notice youve gone back to isolating. You go back to being depressed because you lost control, lost to anxiety, once again. Somewhere must be a door, surely. At some point you must have enough control to get out. Surely, right? It would be unfair if there was no way out."
18za4gv,Depression,2024-01-05,i dont know what im doing,"
im 17f doing my a levels and maybe going to uni this year and i have no idea what im doing. im fairly confident that i am going to fail my a levels. i cant bring myself to study or even try because when i think about the future it all seems so hopeless. even when i think about the present everything is hopeless. its too late for me to start now and even if i did id probably give up anyway. i know im depressed. im fairly suicidal. i think about killing myself a lot and as a solution to my problems. i think im subconsciously sabotaging myself and my life so that i have an excuse to kill myself later down the road. i have an ok life, a great life depending on varying perspectives, no major traumas or struggles, a roof over my head, a family that loves me, i have friends who like me i think; so i dont know why i feel or act like this and i feel guilty and ungrateful that i do. i know that i haven't really lived life since im only 17. everything seems so hopeless. i have no talents or accomplishments and i dont really have a desire to get better or be a better person or try and fix my depression because the thought of having to practice ""mindfulness"" or go to cbt again or go on meds makes me want to puke so maybe i should just die. I just know i have to get better because thats what ur supposed to do. i dont know what to do or what im doing or what im going to do. people tell me not to focus on or think about the future but even when i think about the now it makes me miserable as well. i have god awful self esteem so i dont even like myself either. all my waking thoughts are constantly about starving myself to get skinnier, trying to be pretty, being self consious, wanting to die and how sad my life is going to be. i have no goals, no aspirations, no proper interests. everything is just grey all the time and even for the periods when its not i cant even enjoy it because i know everythings going to be grey again. i know im being a bit of a miserable cunt and its a bit pathetic yeah to be this negative but i am. i dont really feel real lately. like im floating in my own head or something. i dont know what to do. the thought of working for the rest of my life is so draining. im only 17, almost 18, im young, i know i havent actually grown up yet but looking at everything, i dont want to. everyone just seems so miserable and considering how miserable i am now it doesnt look like its going to get much better

im sorry if this doesnt make much sense its just a stream of my thoughts i needed to get out. i know im not alone in feeling like this, but i still feel like this so that doesnt change anything really"
18z9zuy,Depression,2024-01-05,big triumph yesterday and I’m really proud of myself,"I’m 22 and moved into my own place last year (2023), which means i’m essentially on my own now. 
My biggest struggle has always been with taking care of myself. Whether it be giving myself time to breathe, making a meal just for myself and not just because other people are there, forgiving myself for past mistakes and so on. I generally have a much, much better grasp on my mental health now than I ever have before but it’s still one of those things that I have a hard time with.

My biggest vice and biggest insecurity is my teeth. Last time I went to the dentist I was 16, and they found 15 cavities in my teeth. Additionally, I sucked my thumb post-maturely, so I have a somewhat misshapen jaw and quite the significant overbite (like 8mm or something like that).

When I went to that dentist at 16, I don’t know if she was having a bad day or what, but she laid into me hard. Showed me insanely grotesque pictures of people who had sucked their thumb and had intense decay, gum diseases etc. And she didn’t frame it like, “this is what it could be,” she framed it like, “this is what you look like.”

With the power of retrospect I know now that’s not true. My mouth doesn’t LOOK bad and never did. I did have a lot of cavities but they were all smaller ones in between my teeth due to a lack of motivation to floss. But that trip was really scarring and it negatively impacted my self esteem on a serious level. 

Last january I chipped a tooth. Ignored it. Went through a year of excruciating pain anytime I chewed on that side of my mouth. “Who cares, I’ll never have a nice smile anyways.”

Well, no more of that! On tuesday this week I called and made a dentist appointment and I went yesterday. I have 8 cavities and sadly the chipped tooth requires a root canal. But sincerely, not as bad as I thought! and some of the cavities were ones I never went back to get filled so really I’ve only gotten 2 or 3 new ones in the last 6 years.

I’m really, really proud of myself. Paid for the appointment out of pocket as well and set up another appointment to start fixing them up. We even discussed a possibility of trying invisaline to help straighten out some of the crookedness i had as a result of sucking my thumb. 

Even though I got my own place, I’m starting college soon and I’ve landed a job in my field of choice, this feels truly like my first “adult” triumph. Booking appointments and actually following through with them is one of the hardest things for me to do and it feels really good to finally get the wheels in motion and fix up my teeth.

It gets better!!! And if you’re sitting on something like this too, and putting something important off, take the plunge and complete step 1! it was so much easier than i thought it would be and I feel amazing. just wanted to share"

18z9dif,Depression,2024-01-05,"30m, business, childhood trauma, society.","I’m sitting in my car outside of Home Depot, a place I’ve been countless times, I’ve spent my 20s working towards being the best electrician possible, I opened my own business as soon as I legally was able and it went well. I made as much as I thought I would, it changed my life financially as anticipated. 
I ran my own business consistently for 2 years, excellent reviews, consistent work, etc.

Eventually I hit the point where I was no longer scared of making money, and the survival mode mentality about money finally wore off, and like a light switch I can’t get myself to do it anymore. I fucking hate what I do for a living, in the name of money I’ve led myself so far astray, I fucking hate construction and every day I get up and do it I sell parts of my soul, they don’t seem to come back. 

For the last 6 months everyday has been nothing but a battle to make it to the end of the day where I’m tired enough to go to sleep, the only thing I do that feels good is going to the gym and going fucking hard. Half the time I leave to go and do a job or something I find myself crying in the Home Depot parking lot, passing work to other electricians I know. 

I don’t drink and I don’t smoke.

The depressive survival mode has put extreme pressure on my marriage, my wife doesn’t trust me, my subconscious is petrified of leaving the center median where everything is just “fine”, I’m hardwired to lie and cheat as many steps ahead of those around me to avoid making ripples, I find myself caught in my own self made bullshit almost daily so I try to just keep my fucking mouth shut since I can’t trust myself either. One of the reasons I believe I did so well in business. Should I actually be with my wife, Am I bad for her and she just doesn’t know it? Is she bad for me and I’m just not clear enough to see it? We’ve been together 8 years and have had some good times, but I can’t say confidently we’ve had more good than dark.

I’m starting school in a couple weeks for something I’m actually interested in, burnt most of the business down because I don’t give a fuck to do it again.

I’m talking to a therapist, she’s great, she really understands the struggles I speak of and does an amazing job of connecting the feelings I express to experiences of the past and gives me great assignments to work on. 

The gym and conversations with my therapist are the only times I have moments of clarity, the rest of the time I’m just trying not to hurt my wife and get in a fight, and trying not to think about myself in a darker way… I don’t even want to say the S word as it’s an idea I’ve rejected my entire life.  

But fuck man I hurt so much inside."

Feeling particularly emotional today &amp; I have no idea why. Like I can't stop crying. I just feel so lonely numb empty. I should be happy I've made it another year yet if seems to amplify the negative feelings. Like I'm stuck in a void. Time moves forward but I don't. I literally only live to talk to the people on the call lines which is sad &amp; pathetic. If it wasn't for them I'd have kms already &amp; without them it feels so hard to make it through another day. I didn't shower for 10 days either that's how little I care about myself rn.

18z8wq9,Depression,2024-01-05,What to do with life?,"What's a good thing to do in life if I don't like or care about 99.99% of things?

\-not interested in working for a job and wasting my whole day and contributing to society/the matrix/capitalism/consumerism

\-not interested in sports and I really think it's pointless outside of maybe the physical exercise it can give but I'm not really trying to live long for me to want that

\-not interested in religious stuff that doesn't really matter based on my real world logic and application of senses. Also, people are too manipulated by this thing so why would I even jump into something like it?

\-not interested with family units cause people are either just slaves or slave owners in general so most people doesn't really matter which means there's no point for me to build a family in the future as well. Again, I don't really want to contribute to society so it supports that thought.

\-Starting to get bored of video games but still my best sad option right now. It's still just the best option for making this forced existence a little bit tolerable.

\-Ironically I still have 2 sideline jobs at the moment so I'm still contributing to this society I hate so much but it doesn't consume much of my time and it's bare minimum effort so it's minimal contribution to society as I possibly can. It just helps me act like I'm doing something with my life.

I would like to get 2 answers to my question with different scenarios: 1) Assume I have no money 2) I have money and financial freedom at least to do anything I want in my own country(Some 3rd world shithole Asian country)

Also, I asked this all to myself and my final conclusion is ""food and sex' which is literally the baseline of human enjoyment but it's also just sad to think about and I'm looking for better suggestions so here we are lmao.

18z8qy4,Depression,2024-01-05,Tips/Advice for dealing with SAD?,"What do you guys do to get yourself out of a SAD funk, without suggesting medication? Activities, supplements, foods, etc? 


I’m pretty sure I struggle with seasonal affective disorder. I usually start feeling the effects of it 1-2 months after Daylight Saving Time ends, which is now starting to take a toll on me. I don’t feel like anything is really wrong. I’m actually trying to reach deep and figure out what could be bothering me, but there isn’t anything. Things are good in my life right now and there’s really not much I would change. However, I have crying spells almost every morning that can sometimes be uncontrollable. I’m talking to my doctor later this month to hear their thoughts on the matter but I’m not sure what they can do for me because they’re just going to try and recommend SSRI’s (which do not work for me) or sedatives (which for personal reasons I do not want to possess or try) again. They’re aware and understand that my adderall helps me through this, since it quiets my brain and helps me feel “ready” to do my job/studying, and helps with my lethargy. I suppose it feels like I am generally suffering from a more intense insufficiency of dopamine. Can anyone relate?"
18z8291,Depression,2024-01-05,What other coping mechanisms can i do when thoughts are too much?,"I've self harmed but i dont like how it scars. Im thinking of smoking cigarettes but they just seem more trouble in my life (parents will be mad, school will suspend me, etc.), talking it out to my people just make me feel even more miserable, i can't sleep to escape the thoughts because i cant sleep on command when im not sleepy, using phone as distraction wont do cuz phone is one of my triggers.

Idk whats wrong with my me, its like my mind likes to always be miserable so it also makes my therapeutic activities feel miserable.

Any other coping mechanism suggestions? Possibly something that i can do whenever and wherever i am, at home, at school, etc. but tbh i'd take any idea at this point"
18z7ynt,Depression,2024-01-05,What biographies have you read about depression?,"I’ve read sunbathing in the rain and one called shoot the damn dog

There’s a book called darkness visible by William Styron that I haven’t read that’s meant to be interesting 

Have you read any that you can recommend?"
18z7v7d,Depression,2024-01-05,"New to sub, looking for community?","I'm going to be upfront and say I just found this sub after googling ""online depression support group"" and finding an r/depression post from almost a decade ago recommending reddit. I have not read through all the posts here, but I DID read the rules. 

I guess I am here because I know that I need help with my mental health, but I don't have a good support system in my life. I've been trying to deal with this on my own for too long. I feel like conceptually I have a really good understanding of where I am struggling and what actions to take to feel better, but my problem seems to be staying consistent with them. My motivation quickly dissolves and I'm back to laying in bed all day, knowing what I need to do but unable to move. Even when I was on meds and in therapy I was a lot less irritable, but I still didn't feel like I was making progress in building good habbits. 

My childhood was chaotic and set me up with survival skills, but no real coping mechanisms. I think I need the most help with accountability and motivation or keeping momentum. This is where I want to lean on friends and family for support -- but then there isn't anyone there to catch me. And don't have my therapist anymore nor can I afford to find a new one. 

I can't rely on a person, I need a system to ensure I am following through on all my good intentions. When I feel like stopping, it has to change my thinking to say ""no, actually I want to keep going."" 

Has anyone had success with this? Do you have any advice? I've read so many stories like ""I just started [insert mental-health routine] and felt better."" I DO feel better when I finally exercise or paint or do something fun, but it doesn't seem to get any easier to keep initiating that action. If the first step is the hardest one I'm making it over and over again and feeling excausted, not enriched. Over time, the joy is leeched away. I feel defeated or failed by poor brain chemistry. How do I change this lackluster feeling?"
18z7iei,Depression,2024-01-05,"Talked to husband, feeling so alone","I talked to my husband and told him how depressed I was feeling and that I'd thought about hurting myself. He was very concerned and asked if he should take me to the hospital to get help. I told him no, not at this point. He asked if I had a plan, I said vaguely I did, same thing I'd do the last time things got bad. I promised him I'd talk to him before doing anything.

I'm 58, I've been fighting these feelings since I was a teenager. I'm friendlessness, my family has drift apart and I can't talk to my siblings. My Dad is to old to burden with this. We've got no money, which is a big part of the problem. Can't afford to see my therapist. Bill collectors are calling. I'm terrified to talk to them.

I'm forcing myself to eat, no appetite. If I don't be careful, the rare disease I suffer from will act up more and make me sicker. I'm so tired of it all. I never thought life would be like this at my age. I'm so lonely, I don't know what to do"
18z7ibb,Depression,2024-01-05,I'm running out of emotion,"I'm 25 and for the past year I've been thinking about everything in my past. My childhood and how people view me.

I'm running out of ways that I can feel love. I actually hate my friends a few days ago I told myself I won't hang out with them anymore. They always just used the shit out of me. They lived at home with me and didn't pay rent multiple times, my mom would get angry. I was going to college and decided to go full time. I had to drop out because I almost went crazy. 

They never cared about what I was going through

One of them invited my ex and his friend over, I was passive and allowed it. I hate myself. I try to be nice, honestly no point.

This past year I've been kind of antisocial and asocial. Literally for all the times that I looked at something while I was obviously being stabbed in the back. No point.

I never cheated on my girlfriend nor could I.

We only dated in high school. I wasn't fit until after we broke up. I hate disloyalty, when girls get attention they love it.

I see almost no point in dating as a loser 25 year old. I want sex and sad part for me is I can actually give it, I just don't know how to be someone else to get. The person that I am only has loner hobbies, usually places where people meet are just shallow and loud. I'm a fish everytime.

It's honestly harder for men to cheat, easy for women. I feel like whatever I have to offer in some social relationship will be laughed at and considered useless. The clothes I wear, music I like, things i can draw, food I can cook, even my body and dick. The only guys that'll have merit are guys with money, 

I would literally feel like some stupid 10 year old trying to talk to someone.

I'm also tall and blonde. People hate that I'm tall, it's only because they didn't get to be tall and I did.

If you saw me on the street you wouldn't assume that this post was mine. You'd probably think I'm shit or a loser. Honestly for a lot of my life I was nice, I see less and less reason to. I'm not really that selfish I just hate being used and fucked over.

I quit a job a year ago I worked 24hr shift rotations back to back 2 in a row then night shift. I didn't sleep or eat enough and I kind of went crazy again.

I feel like it doesn't matter how hard I try I'm just always gonna get stabbed for being nice.

It's so easy for me to jump to aggression and ""fuck you"" attitude. I keep living in this loop of ""be nice to meet a girl"" followed by ""fuck you nice guys finish last and get all the slops"" I'm not wrong. 

I honestly see no point in being nice it just hurts me.

I've had a lot shitty childhood problems I hate my dad, he had anger problems and could be inappropriate as fuck. He'd parade me around and not have the slightest that i was in constant fear and social agony around him. I used to watch porn a lot, not really anymore though. I hate watching porn, it's a tease. All for them nothing for you loser.  My dad showed me stuff as a kid I hated it, sometimes he'd make inappropriate sexual remarks about him and mom. I even saw porn at a younger age on my brother's computer a couple times, he left it up and I saw it.

I hate what connection is supposed to be, I literally cannot feel it and honestly I feel sort of autistic in the sense I can't make any new friends. For what reason? I'm just gonna get used again.

I used to like going down on girls. Honestly they don't deserve it, I don't even really like blowjobs either. Past a certain age no woman deserve cunnilingus, they've gotten cummed in more than most dudes have partners and that jizz and scent isn't yours or hers it's the last guy she was with. GROSS"

18z6kiw,Depression,2024-01-05,In a depressive episode and I wish I can go back to regular depression,"I forgot what it’s like to not have depression since I’ve been depressed for so long. But now I’m struggling with this horrible episode and even the things I used to use as distractions (music, movies, books, anime, games, going out..) are triggering to me now and make me feel worse, I miss being numb and empty rather than whatever the hell this is.

I only feel slightly safer when I think about death or when I’m asleep. none of the techniques my therapist recommended helped me feel less insane or completely hopeless.

I can’t believe this but I keep telling myself that I took being everyday depressed and numb outside of depressive episodes for granted and I wish I can go back to that"

But that's impossible, so why bother living? To suffer more?

I'm fat, I have hirsutism, problems with acne all over my body, stretch marks, cellulite, dark spots in certain areas, 40% of my hair is already white

my house is hell, my family is made up of the worst people, they disgust me. I wanted to see them all dead, so they would stop torturing me. I don't have a job so I have no way out of this hell. But I can't stand being here anymore

Not even my psychologist pretends to care. Every time I'm in crisis, when I say I'm going to kill myself, she just ignores me. She thinks I don't have the courage.

Even though I applied for several job openings, no one called me and when the results of the entrance exam come out and my parents see that I failed, they will want to force me to study. I'd rather get shot in the forehead than continue living this hell, especially because my dream of leaving here and starting a family with this celebrity I love is impossible. I've been dead inside for years. Why shouldn't I end this agony, why not kill myself and finally have peace?

The only condition I had to continue living in 2024 was if my parents helped me leave this country, and that way I could work with books in the USA or Europe. But they refused to help, which means that if I continue to live I will remain stuck here, studying what I don't want and eventually working on what I don't want.

I just want this to end, no one is going to help me get out of here or give me books (in my country they are extremely expensive and I can't afford them) so I have nothing to live for anyway"

There is other shit but it's just pissing me off thinking about it because she lives in a different country. It's not like I haven't gone out of situations like this before but I've been fighting so long for a life I fucking hate for so long that finally my luck has run out.

18z3x7i,Depression,2024-01-05,Family not making no effort to move out house.,"Hi, I’m a 18 year old male who currently lives with my mom/aunt (59F)and grandparents. I’m still in high school this year as it will be my last year. I’ve been living here since July and they purchased a new house that they were expecting to be in around August or September, but my GM’s dementia has got in the way of that as she’s being resistant towards moving out. They keep changing when they want to move they said they wanted to be by December or November now it’s January. My GM (80 F) doesn’t want to move because she’s a narc that’s all about control and she feels like she can’t control anything because my GP and Aunt/mom bought the house in their name. So she’s resistant to moving despite it not being healthy for everyone. My Aunt has been away from her family for 2 years taking care of them and her parents live in this two bed room town house with and upstairs so theirs not much room as both GPs have their own room they sleep in so which forces us to sleep in the loft space on the couch or air mattress. My Aunt/Mom slept on the mattress for about two years and has a bad disc in her back which is not good and causes her pain. 

I swear I fucking hate this shit. I’ve already purchased beds, Mattresses and have my car at the new house which is and hour away from the one I’m at now but I can’t go in there and live cuz they believe I’m still immature enough to live on my own.

But I have no privacy GM is annoying and distracts me when I’m doing school work. I have no space to be alone cuz everything is in open space.

They’ve told me I could go back and live with my bio moms mom/ my grandmother until they move  which makes no sense as I’ve explained to multiple times to them she uses me for money but they never listen to me. I’ve thought about getting a job here but they told me not to as where gonna move. I’m thinking about getting one despite what they say because yall keep saying your gonna move but it doesn’t seem like your doing anything to move out this damn house like wtf.
They helped me get health insurance cuz my bio mom took me off hers due to abuse going on in the home. But I still haven’t been to a doctor ever since the insurance has been active because of them moving so fucking slow and not making things a priority. I haven’t to a damn doctor in a fucking year.

My aunt/mom is really moving to Charlotte the city we are supposed to be moving  to help her daughter out who has a little girl and she needs help raising her. Her husband and younger daughter are moving down as well but can’t really move like they want to cuz of the GM being so difficult.

What should I do? I sleep on the couch every night and my back is starting to hurt.I have a uncle of my bio mom who lives not too far from here in my Great Grands house who has 
3 bed rooms and a beds. But I’ve heard things about how he likes to use people for money from what my bio mom has said.

To tell the truth I really don’t have that many choices. My Mom is no longer a option due to her abusive husband and her mental emotional abuse towards me and her mom isn’t because as I mentioned she uses me for money and likes to talk down to me if I don’t live my life the way she wants to and makes me feel like a awful person.

I have no control over my life and it’s frustrating. And I’m to broke to move out so…

What should I do?"

I can't do right in anything in life. All my relationships were shitshow. Every workplaces I joined go to hell. Like literally, pay goes down, people get fired. I'm fricking Trojan horse.

Every time I think:""now I'm happy and everything will be good""... It's just getting worse and worse. So for now all I wanted to be content, just exist to not upset my relatives.

But I get tired. All things what happened I survived. And the only person to blame for bringing me to the final edge is myself. 

I was planning to kms for 2 weeks. Found it kinda funny, did post something, my photos (so it would be lost forever in the dark). And when time come I was to chicken to slice it. And I deleted everything, cause it actually not really funny. So just bought some pills, took everything at home. And I failed even this. I guess I mostly throw it all out. Not by my choice. Hoped maybe I could end it peacefully in sleep. Nah, nope, nothing peaceful in my life will ever go.

I am awful person. Many people said me kind words and etc. it was nice, but it can't help. I even messaged 2 people, it was quite humiliating really, for needed help. But they ignored. And really I can't blame them. Because it's not anyone concern and it looks like just a scam. I actually kinda expected this, but ya know, at least it was a try.

Why am I even writing this all? I donno, it will be ignored, it should be ignored. I actually don't really want to die, but I did this to myself. Maybe I should at least finish something I planned in my life for once."

But you know what actually makes me want to die. Debt. Debt I have no shot at paying off and retiring when I want on my barely above minimum wage salary because I'm shit at making money. 

I can't afford to get sick and end up in the hospital and the stress and pressure of providing for myself is driving me insane. Bringing out a lot of bad coping and I feel like I'm being challenged to do something more. To create something for myself.

I’ve found it’s incredibly hard as a guy compared to a girl to make freinds,  I’ve tried apps and sites to no success there are no groups to join and then I’m like well you don’t just find a best mate round the corner!

18z2n3x,Depression,2024-01-05,I said some sad stuff I want to walk back.,"Y’all, I started Vilazodone this week. I made a post about “becoming like a robot.” I can’t, I won’t do that. This medicine is fast acting, though more expensive. It is an SSRI with buspirone aspects. Lower chance of flatter emotions. Also lower sexual side effects (42 year old, never been in a relationship, hope to, somehow change that though i still feel deeply unattractive.)

I don’t want to be an emotionally stunted person. I DO want to become less socially awkward (even though I think a lot of my awkwardness is my imagination, made up from depression and untreated ADHD.)

I have a psychological evaluation on the 10th, ADHD screening on the 5th of February, and I am going to try to find a therapist that will work with my insurance. I need weekly therapy, to be sure, as I am far from out of the woods."

I habe a date and plan and I've even worked on letters . I'm begging someone to talk some reason into me . Is it normal to be this fucking miserable for no apparent good reason I think of my pets and husband and I know they will eventually be ok ... My stepdaughter who is 18 could give a shit less .it would probably make her jump for joy she absolutely hates me and I promise I'm not terrible to her been in her life since she was 11 . I want to tell my husband how I'm feeling maybe a physc visit is in order but what would that accomplish I've been like this for years

18z2dtj,Depression,2024-01-05,Do I have depression? or maybe what specific type,"I feel like the obvious answer is yes. I cry randomly for no reason and socially distance myself. Have trouble keeping up with hygiene and stress eat. I have trouble talking to people or thinking straight.

Sometimes I’m just not there. Like I just sorta try to function but my mind is racing with negative thoughts. (i hear most people just don’t feel anything so i’m confused)

I have the thought of this a lot, “fuck everyone, what’s the point of socializing. i’m just going to move schools.”

But there’s some oddities like when someone talks to me I sorta snap out of it for a bit. And it’s more like episodes rather than a constant feeling.

I also just start venting to random people?

That doesn’t seem right."
18z2bho,Depression,2024-01-05,Breaking the cycle. A rant,"I got nothing new to say honestly. I just freak out and lash out(verbally only) at the few people who I care about, they understand it, but of course it still hurts them.

I really can't muster the motivation to better myself unless it involves my goal of gaining affection and intimacy. Last year I had to just sit down and take the fact that life denied me what I had earned for honestly no reason..and now I'm faced with the fact that this year many be the only chance I have left at gaining this very narrow minded goal that means more than living to me at this point. I'm stubborn in this pursuit to find meaning in the sole way I've chosen to do so. I get it, it's wrong but I've never been able to push myself to do anything that doesn't involve getting what I want. And what I want is to prove that this ever growing relationship that I have built is real, yes I'm 100% that this online girlfriend I'm dating is real, video calls, pictures, and etcetera. When I say real I mean in the sense that it's still unbelievable that I have found what I would consider an amazing person who is just as beautiful on the inside as she is one the outside. This success, this relationship, this person...I need this to be real otherwise I doubt I'm capable of obtaining anything of note in life. It's more than even that, I need her support to. 


In conclusion, this being my main source of depression, the inability to realize my one and only dream which is associated with one of the most important people in my life. I'm Happy until I remember life isn't going my way, I get depressed, I lose the will to distract myself, I get more depressed, I'm reminded of my goal and how close I am, I'm happy enough to start distracting myself again, and then the cycle repeats. At the end of the day all the answers are before me and I will never accept them.

Because if I can't achieve the dream I have no control over what's the point of trying?"

I think because I know how it feels to be empty I try to always make others happy all the time. Many times I wish I wasn’t here - never been born - semi would take me out - massive aneurysm would burst and just take me out of my misery. I don’t literally want to do it I just don’t want to feel this way anymore. I hate the holidays they make everything worse. I feel myself snapping - like getting mad and snippy with my kids and then feel like the biggest POS ever. I just want to be a good mom. My relationship is crap with my SO and I’m just deleted.

I'm in no position for a custody battle right now because my dad recently moved in with my fiance and I and are taking up the only room I could have used for my girls. I have far too many animals to take care of, and some of my grandparent's too. I'm too busy everyday and a lot of the shit I do isn't even mine to be concerned about.

 My fiance has bad seizures and will sometimes forget who I am and it is the saddest thing. Sometimes I think if she was to pass away, I would take my own life and it's sad because I don't feel like I can talk to anyone about it and it just tears me apart inside everyday. I don't know if I'll be able to see my girls, or even hear their voices again and I feel so wronged, I wasn't even the bad parent. We had our first before we turned 20 and the second one 2 years later and I did everything for them, now when I find their toys or clothes or birthday balloons, I just want to fall to my knees. I get so weak and sad I just want to die, and I really hope she isn't filling my kids with lies about me but all I can think about is, if I happen to cease to exist, what do I write for them and how do I know they will get it when they can understand.

The problem is that I HAVE to deal with these people, I can’t just ignore their existence.

I don’t expect to be supported like my mother supported me, but this is too much. I was treated like a princess by her, and now I feel like I am a burden. It’s like my whole birth is a mistake.

 I'm in complete despair. Almost all of my problems stem from a lack of energy. Has anyone managed to raise their energy levels? I take vitamins, hormones are fine, after 4 years of treatment on different antidepressants and different doctors, I don’t know why I have so little energy. I realized that you can choose medications for years, until you are old, and no one guarantees that you will feel even a little better. It is pointless.
 I heard obvious advice about eating healthy, drinking water, going outside, and so on. But how to do this without energy? Force yourself? Do all people just force themselves to live every day?  Any treatment or even searching for the cause of depression requires energy, which I don’t have at all. Is the problem negative thinking? But how do people manage to deny obvious facts, such as the fact that for several years I have done nothing about my depression? Or that I still can’t provide for myself? How can you not see this as your failure? Isn't it a lie if you keep saying everything is fine when everything is obviously terrible? It seems to me that therapy is like looking at a nuclear explosion and continuing to say, “let's look at this from a different angle.”  Why am I so tired all the time that my brain is broken?

18z0w71,Depression,2024-01-05,Conflicted,"I just, don’t know how to feel right now. This isn’t a major depression post, I just kinda need to vent to random people tbh. 

I just. Don’t know how to feel about…rather anything anymore. I barely find joy in activity I used to love, like Video Games and Debate, and my family life is just depressing to say the least. My dog died last November, been with us since I was 1. My sisters are all assholes except for one but we barely talk as it is. It funny, my Niece lived with us for about 3 months because my oldest sister life was horrible and she was cheating on her husband, barely had money, was an alcohol addict…I really thought I was a big brother to my Niece. Guess I can just say, I feel Lonely. Me and my Niece fought ofc, but I actually felt like a big brother. This was a weird idea I wanted, Born the youngest as a boy with three older sister. But sadly my sister came in December, a day before Christmas and had the police come. My Niece was forced to go back…I haven’t spoke to her since that day.

In debate, I just haven’t felt the same. It not fun, I feel like my teammates and me don’t have any connections and I tried to form some. But I guess I’m just that tall “awkward” guy. Some of them jokingly pick at me for being “Bi-Polars”…I’m questioning if I am. My mom was Bi-Polars and apparently I’m showing “symptoms” of being Bi-Polar. I remember going home from debate practice after being told that I’m Bi-Polar a couple of time as an insult. First time I actually had a mental breakdown of sorts. Just being told I’m Bi-Polar set me off for some reason…I mean I always knew I had massive mood swings, random feeling of not being worth anything, and just loneliness on a huge level but just being told that makes me wanna cry.

I just feel lonely, sad, and just no one to talk too anymore. Guess I just find solace in the words of random online strangers. Well, Thank if you’re reading this and stuff. I’m not suicidal if you’re wondering that, I just feel like I lost myself over the past few months."
18z0vsx,Depression,2024-01-05,Struggling tonight,"I’m just struggling with those old feelings of hopelessness and misery.  I do not understand it.  I’ve tried so many things to simply feel normal and content.  Not even necessarily happy and joyful.  Just content.  Medications, counseling, treatments, new relationships, dating new and wonderful women that truly love and care about me, churches, support groups, begging for mercy from God.  

 I’m not going to hurt myself or another but the pain I experience is unbearable.  I don’t even know what it comes from.  I’m relatively successful, intelligent, attractive, kind and loved.  

But I don’t feel loved.  I dont feel smart.  I don’t feel successful.  I don’t feel content or happy.  I have no sense of belonging or peace.  I experience no sense of having a home to call my own.  I feel no sense of stability. I look in the mirror and inside myself and see ugliness though logically I know I am a reasonable and decent person and atleast a moderately good looking dude.  I feel no love from anyone or anything.

I know it’s unattractive to be needy but It’s like I need constant reminders from people that I am even basically an okay person so I feel okay.  When, intellectually I am completely certain that I am an incredible person!  Some of my gifts, talents, experiences and wisdom are the things some people can only dream of.  Though I am humble in my heart and never ever brag about myself.

I cry myself to sleep most nights and I’m a grown ass man that wrestled and was a fucking killer in football when I was a kid.  I have a masters degree, 10 years of professional career experience with promotions.  I started my own analytics business.  I even make decent money, when I’m employed.  Wtf is going on?  Why am I miserable??

As helpless as it may sound, I’m confident that a beautiful on the inside and out, smart, loyal and loving female companion to grow and build a life with would bring me back to life and save it.  I’ve dated a few real life human angels and even the couple years we had together were the happiest and most loved I’ve ever felt.  Literally I’ve experienced and worshiped Gods love through the grace kindness strength and beauty of some of these women.  And even though we didn’t get married I am thankful for the time they graced me with.  What woman would have me in this pathetic state of utter weakness.  What kind of a real man desperately wants to be saved by the kindness  beauty and strength of a woman that is probably looking for some stability.  I am at my most weak right now.  And I know what any decent person would say.  The perfect woman will come into your life when you are in good shape and ready to build a successful life with them.  And not looking for them.  But I cannot help but be in the opposite position right now.  I need help from an angel.

I am haunted by sadness, loneliness and maybe a little self hatred for no logical reason and on paper I no longer possess anything that a great woman would want in their life.  I have no full time job, no car, no apartment or house, no money, few real friends, I can be extremely difficult to deal with sometimes, confidence is in the shitter, no stability and I am often confused and fearful about the world.  My talents and IQ are off the charts but it is wasted on thinking too much and questioning everything.

I know we are just internet people and I’m hoping most of you aren’t scammers or ai bots, but I am desperate for connection with people and sincere caring.  I’m the kind of guy that would work for free to help people my whole life and I’d give the shirt off my back to pretty much anyone if they needed.  

Please help me.  I need humanity.  I need love.  And I don’t know what else I need to relieve this unbearable burden.  An angel

Please be kind, especially the women that may choose to comment.  I’ve been hurt by women in my life and I’m so weak and vulnerable right now.

Thank you bless you and I hope I can help you as well."

I spent all my life being the bigger person and I’ll usually be the first to reconcile any issues, but recently I’ve become numb to the feeling of betrayal, I become less and less receptive to the feeling each time something happens to me. It happens so often I can almost see it before it happens. I’m on the brink of frenzy, deep down I have an overwhelming urge to enact revenge on everyone who’s ever wronged me, I’ve given my heart to many women and many friends, only for them to spit it back in my face.

I’ve grown all too emotionless to allow the misfortunes of my life to conjure an emotional breakdown.

It’s consistent disappointment with the different aspects of my life. Not sure how to look at things with less pessimistic outlook if it’s the only way I’ve felt for 20+ years. I’m fucking my life up with resentment from disappointment on unreasonable levels. When I was a kid I would be dissatisfied with a toy with a few days and would just completely move on.

I will give slight context; I deal with MDD, OCD and am compulsive, very naive and have dealt with CPTSD for a long time now. I'm in college and almost too kind if im being honest. Last night my roomate hooked up with someone I was dating and I tried to pretend that I didn't know about it, but all of a sudden I became very very hopeless about a love life, it really made me drop to my knees. I just ran into my room, started crying very heavily, then all of a sudden, I just spaced out and felt nothing, then I began to smile and laugh hysterically. I went to the bathroom in this indescribable state and started laughing at myself in the mirror. I went into the kit hen area while they weren't there and grabbed a huge kitchen knife to bring to my bathroom. I played some classical music in the background and I felt so at peace, and then all of a sudden I started slashing my throat. Alot of times, and I remember laughing about it. I then took off all my clothes and walked out into the cold with nothing but briefs. I embraced how harsh the weather was for me and somehow it brought me great joy. I dont remeber much of last night, but the next thing I remembered was waking up in my bed with blood around my throat and everything in my room either thrown, shattered or missing. I honestly don't know what happened to me, and then I just started crying because I knew something psychologically happened to me. I think I should probably go see someone."

Why does my physical existence make me so miserable. I don’t want a body I just want to be me"
18yzuas,Depression,2024-01-05,Someone shot me with a pellet gun for no reason,"I was walking home after working out at my gym. It wasn't late however it was dark due to daylight savings. All of a sudden I feel a sharp pain on my thumb and drop my phone. I was shocked however at the time my mind didn't instantly go to damn I got shot by a pellet gun. However when I picked my phone from the ground, a phone I have only had for about 5 months it's brand new and I got it as a gift. It had dead pixels on it and wasn't responding when I tried to turn it off. I continue walking and then hear something ricochet off the cement. That's when I knew it was probably someone shooting at me. So I started running. I get to the nearest gas station. I go inside and ask the clerk if there's been incidents of pellet shooting around. He say's no, then the guy behind me in line says his daughters was shot in the shoulder a while back by a random pellet gun. He said I was lucky it hit my phone and not my thumb. Although my thumb was swollen because it still ricochet off my phone and hit my thumb. He encouraged me to call the cops to make a report. And so I did, the first officer to show up was really nice and understanding. However the second officer came at me really rude. He kept asking me the distance from where I was shot and I tried my best to describe it with words however since I wasn't specific he started talking to me like I was in the wrong. I told him I just didn't want it happening to anybody else. So I pulled google maps to sort of pinpoint where I thought I got shot. I still showed all the officers respect. This situation was really traumatic, I'm a really nice guy. I work out everyday, I'm respectful to others. And it's a bummer these kids are going to get away with it most likely. I was walking back from the gym to get my cardio in since I was told I should do more cardio for my health instead of just doing heavy weights. Since I have been having health problems related to blood pressure. I did some cardio at the gym and I wanted to do more on the walk back. However I guess it was a mistake since I got shot with pellet gun lol. All over someone who finds enjoyment in suffering trying to find some entertainment. And it doesn't help that one of my closest cousins that I grew up with got shot with a real gun recently over an argument. The pellet gun hurt I can only imagine what he's feeling right now in the hospital. This is my first time posting on here, I just wanted to see if anyone had similar stories."
18yz4jz,Depression,2024-01-05,Self image issues,"I have no idea what I look like and I am freaking out! Ok so quick backstory! I was bullied back in middle school/ high school for my looks. I developed a major ED back then and barely ate anything. My self confidence was non existent and my once happy and bubbly self became a depressed and closed off teen. I constantly tried to find ways to feel prettier. Ok so after graduating I had a depressive episode for 3 years I didn’t leave my house at all. I found comfort in being home as I didn’t have to worry about my appearance or being judged. In order to cope I began to over eat and I gained weight. I am now 20 and trying to figure everything out. Now that I am trying to get my life back together I have an extreme fear of being back into society. I am keep taking pictures of myself and trying to figure out what I look like. I have no idea because I look different in the mirror, front camera and back camera. I like how I look in some pictures but some make me want to cry. I am just really confused and don’t know how to handle it. I also recently met this guy who really likes me but I saw his Ex and she looks absolutely opposite of me and is STUNNING. So I pushed him away because I felt like maybe he doesn’t find me actually pretty or feels bad for me idk. I feel like It is driving me insane and I am feeling like just wanting to stay home is the best solution for me. It honestly causes me to not want to do anything."
18yz4ce,Depression,2024-01-05,Family wants me to grow but doesn't want me to go.,"Hi all. I'm a bit fucked up rn. In the head to be clear but I guess that's why we're all here. I'm just pissed and sad. Ever since I graduated high school years ago everything's been a fucking nightmare. First year into what was meant to be the rest of my life was COVID. That fucked everything up for my social life and school-life. I've got no one in my area but my family. And it feels like my father hates me. Or doesn't understand me. Either way it feels the same. My father said ""You're 23 and you want to move out and be an adult then fucking do it, I'm tired of paying for you. You only see your mother and I as a paycheck."" After I was frustrated that he wouldn't listen to me about some fucking dumb shit I was dealing with when it came to some fucking medical company billing me despite me already paying them.

I'm just broken after that.... Normally I would shrug it off as him being a dickwipe like I usually do but idk. This was coming as I started going to therapy and trying to get my shit together. I'm already really self-conscious because of mental state you have to be in to grow. And the combined stress of the last few weeks of work, my bills and getting auto-billed for something I forgot about right after I bought all the Christmas presents, and my Dad basically outright saying I'm a heartless piece of shit when I know I'm not just kinda made me snap. I fucking started crying when I couldn't remember the password to my bank account. My brain was so foggy I couldn't even remember. I screamed in my car so much and so loud I got home and had essentially forced myself into a cardiac event.

I'm just so fucking sad. So sad my fucking bones hurt. I'm just sick of being treated like shit by people and not having any human connections cause everything in the world fucking paralyzes me.

I just feel like I fell through the cracks and no one wants to give me the time of day. I'm so alone. I wanted to move out cause I'm just sick of being stuck at home and not living my life like for fucks sake I have some friends who're planning on getting married and I haven't even been out there in ages. And that fight about moving caused such a huge fuss my family dynamic has basically changed. I don't even think they realize what they just did to me. I don't feel suicidal I think. But I just kinda don't care anymore. Does that make me passively suicidal? I just keep fucking shit up. I try and I try and end up back where I started again. But this time I'm 23 instead of 19.

I know the steps I gotta take to be happier. I just wish people wouldn't be such miserable cunts at the fact I don't want to be sad anymore and that I now have a fucking spine."
18yz085,Depression,2024-01-05,How much longer?,"I’m sick of struggling and fighting. My compo got cut off today because some idiot shrink I talked to for AN HOUR says I’m fine. Great. I literally had to fight to convince them I wasn’t fine. I’m not fine. And I don’t know how much longer I can fight. I’m so tired. I’m almost 50, no job, no relationship, no fucking help. How do you keep going?"
18yyzwc,Depression,2024-01-05,I feel like I’m sinking deeper and deeper.,"I’ve been out of work for months. I had a breakdown at the end of May after my grandfather died.

18yyzl5,Depression,2024-01-05,just need some support.,"ive been struggling severely with major depressive disorder since i was a young child aged 11, im 21 now and ive been in such a deep depression these past 2 months after getting out of the mental hospital after an attempt that failed. my partner screamed at me tonight and told me that its all my fault that im struggling like this and that i need to get up and fix my life, but im genuinely so broken and with all of my family members living over 1000 miles away in another state and all of my friendships having fallen off due to me being unable to communicate for months due to my mental health and feeling like i burden the people i love, i have nobody to go to and im so tired of being alone at my worst and blamed for not having any drive left in me, i just want to give up."
18yyz6v,Depression,2024-01-05,I keep thinking of something my dad said a few months before he died.,"When my dad was at the end of his life and was sick and suffering, I remember one day he randomly told me he felt like he just wanted to lie down and never get up again and that he ""didn't want to be part of it anymore"".

He passed away a couple of months later, he was in his eighties.

I think of what he said a lot now, because these days I feel exactly the same way. But I am not yet 40.

Is this what I have to look forward to? Another 40 or so years of feeling depressed, unhappy, permanently fatigued and enjoying nothing in life but sleeping.

I wonder how my dad lasted as long as he did, it took him over 80 years before he got to the stage of wanting to lie down and not get up again. I guess he was made of harder stuff than me."
18yyo2c,Depression,2024-01-05,Got out of bed at 9:20pm today,I dont have the motivation to do anything. It's horrible. Nothing and nobody seems to help. I feel like an empty shell. I wish I could have feelings again.
18yyi73,Depression,2024-01-05,How do I stop being lazy?,"All I do is lay in bed all day and come up with excuses as to why I can do anything. “I wanna go to the store! Too bad, I have no motivation or energy to go” every single day, nothing changes. I want to get my life on track but have no idea where to start, it’s so frustrating"
18yyf7f,Depression,2024-01-05,New to depression and am struggling,"I’m still somewhat new to depression. About 2 months and it’s been really bad in the past 2-3 weeks.

5 months of sleep maintenance insomnia, daily anxiety, and stressors have contributed to how I feel now and I hate it.

I have anxiety and ocd prior to depression, and I’ve been getting dogpiled by everything. My days are spent challenging every intrusive thought, dealing with intense emotions, and reassuring myself that none of these feelings are true. I find myself eating a lot less lately and staying inside playing video games to distract my mind.

Depression has been a pretty big fear for me for awhile. The idea of feeling like giving up on life and feeling suicidal bothered me for a long time, and the threat of these feelings have been incredibly stressful.

Today I found myself trying to address a past insecurity that I’ve paid barely any attention to for years. Prior, my OCD has been constantly bringing this to the table as an issue (even though it’s not) and I’ve been trying to brush it off, but now with depression at play, it’s been hard to let it go. Despite having found a better way to feel about it and to let it go, I still feel strange. It’s almost as if my brain is trying to find something to attach this depression to and it chose THAT, because instead of getting some sort of relief from the depressive mood, I feel very conflicted.

I don’t know if I feel deeply disappointed and irredeemable about it to the point I can’t find acceptance in myself for it or if I’m tripping out. I literally did nothing wrong, just a cringey thing I did during puberty. Nonetheless, I don’t know where my head is at currently. I want to put my mind into something else, but it’s hard.

I don't know what to do, and I feel lost and stuck. It's becoming increasingly challenging to brush off these overwhelming feelings and thoughts that seem utterly disgusting. I fear that these emotions are true, and I may act on them without realizing it. While I'm currently very self-aware, the intensity of these emotions is driving me to the edge.

EDIT: Depression is trash, and I really would be able to deal with shit way better if it didn’t mess with my perceptions. Moments when it feels intense, it feels like my mind is stuck in a box, and when it wanes off, it feels like the box opens and my brain feels free and my senses come back. Going through a lot of meta emotions"
18yya32,Depression,2024-01-05,Why do I hate myself.,"I don't like being me. I feel like I constantly annoy people and just get mad at myself and others. I'm Autistic (Asbergers), and ADHD and It feels like I was screwed over by life in general and my mood can just change like a fucking light and I hate it. I never wanted to make this post but It feels like a genuine struggle not to cry about the stupidest bullshit."
18yy8i4,Depression,2024-01-05,I’m so sad,"Life has been so hard lately. I feel like it’s turned to a series of unfortunate events. October was hell with an insane workload for a new job. Planning and hosting an entire festival, flying for recruitment events, and an ovarian cyst that had ruptured and adhered to my intestine, an unplanned surgery to fix said ovary and a bonus surgery to get my tubes tied. November came with drama from a friend I consider my ride or die. She’s unhappy and won’t admit it to herself and is actively self-sabotaging. December met me with the same friend finally discussing how hurt she was by a hard decision that had to be made regarding her attending a thanksgiving dinner with 4 plus ones we weren’t expecting and couldn’t accommodate. She then sabotages a friendship with her new boyfriend’s friends. My only other ride or die is going through a very difficult relationship challenge with an actual sociopath, a divorce is imminent but she isn’t in a place that she can actually land on her own two feet if she files. I fell down a flight of stairs and became massively bruised and jammed up. New Year’s Day brought the death of my cat that I raised from 4 weeks old until she was nearly 18. I had to make the brutal decision of a kind death rather than letting her starve to death from intestinal cancer. Boyfriend drama friend wasn’t supportive and rather than consoling me about losing what was essentially my first child, continued to make all discussions about her and how she fucked up with her boyfriend’s friends. 
My life has been hell. I keep trying to keep my head up and not shoulder too much of anyone else’s issues but I’ve failed. The loss of my cat, my friends relationships imploding, raising two young children, and trying to conquer a demanding job have completely wrung me out. My depression is palpable. I feel like a zombie. I just want to hide in a hole and cry. But I have to put up a front for everyone in my life and I’m just so tired. 
I just really need the people in my life to stop relying on my strength and allow me to be the weak link for awhile. 
I’m so tired. I’m so sad. I don’t understand why karma has been so rough on me. I try so hard to be there for everyone and I choose kindness in all situations. What did I do to deserve all of this heartache?"
18yxw4f,Depression,2024-01-05,I hate myself because I lack social skills.,"It's having a negative impact on my job. Getting out of bed in the morning has become a struggle due to my overwhelming sense of being different. Throughout my life, I've experienced social isolation, and unfortunately, it has carried over into my adult years. As a result, my coworkers treat me poorly, although I don't blame them. I am aware that their behavior is influenced by my own actions. However, I wish they were aware of the challenges I've faced, so they could understand that my behavior is not deliberate. I simply lack the necessary social skills to interact comfortably with others. It has gotten so bad that I’m starting to have thoughts of self harm."
18yxsdg,Depression,2024-01-05,I'm ok with dying i dont really wanna be here,"Im 20 and have been dealing with depression sense pre K this shit is not fun its exhausting, and i didnt really get support from family. things just got worst for me over the years everytime i feel something if finally going right. as of now i have no contact with my family so im struggling by myself. its been like that sense my senoir year in highschool. im not gonna get into that but the point is ok with dying not only because of the thing ive been through but because i feel like there is no point in me living. I know people would be sad when im gone but i dont want to suffer anymore. call me selfish but its what i feel my body cant physically take anymore. If i was in any situation of my life being at risk ill take that risk and womt think twice."
18yxrr6,Depression,2024-01-05,I cant do it. I am forever lost and broken.,"Why is it so hard to have such simple joy of a life, for some of us. It's killing me. I know i am my own illness, but i cant find peace of happiness [anywhere.](https://anywhere.Do) Do i look a certain way, do i give off a vibe, idk.   
But i find a matching person and it never works, and idk why. Are they just enjoying messing with me, do i attract this person, cause it happens so often i think this life is messing with me. I am the joke of my own movie. 

idk how to fix this and feel the will to live properly, it makes me just want to stay in the dark, give up and drug myself until my last days, and throw it all away all hope, what hope is there for me."
18yxr26,Depression,2024-01-05,"Man, this is getting tiring","I don't really know what to write here I guess I'm just venting. I mean it doesn't matter how many turns my life makes I just sort of end up in a major depressive cycle sooner or later. I thought money might fix it but no, not women either. Certainly not drugs. Not fast cars, not nice apartment, not sex. I just end up ""sad"" maybe not sad but empty I guess. I suppose I don't see the point. No one really understands what I mean. It's not that I wanna die it's just that I struggle to see what the point is. I just lay awake thinking and overthinking and missing people or things or times. I don't know. I want off this fucking roller-coaster but if I tell anyone that they'll judge me for it quietly and leave me I can't trust anyone. I can't open up to anyone because they either don't understand it or they'll end up leaving me if I can't be what they want me to be. I hate having absolutely no one who gets it anymore. I hate feeling so uncared for. I really do hate that it keeps coming back to this. I feel like I have no one. I miss things I never had."
18yxqbk,Depression,2024-01-05,I want to run away,"I hate living at home, my dad is an alcoholic and he doesn’t hurt me or abuse me at all but just the fact that I have to see him be drunk to the point where he pisses all over the bathroom floor makes me want to run away from home. He tried to sneak alcohol into my college graduation but saw that we had to go through security and I had to watch him drink it all before going in the building. I don’t know why but that really messed me up. I don’t think I hate him but I wish my parents got divorced.   I feel bad wishing that since divorced parents is something a lot of other people struggle with. When I was young they would fight sometimes over infidelity and alcohol but my mom puts up with it in the end for me and my siblings.

I want to leave home so bad, but the job offer I got after graduation can’t give me work until I pass a lot of important tests. Today I did awful on one of the most important tests I had to do and I feel like I destroyed my chance to escape from home. I don’t even know when I’ll hear back about the results. It could be months.  I feel like killing myself or running away from home but I can’t afford to live by myself and I’m too scared to die. My mom’s cousin who was only 30 died suddenly this year from a blood clot and it’s makes me feel awful about wanting to die. 

I’m so tired of everything I don’t even want to be around my boyfriend anymore. I’m irritable because I have mild chronic knee pain that feels like it gets worse with stress but I’m too scared to go to a doctor. Today after I bombed my test I told my best friend I wanted to drive my car into a ditch and die but they thought I was just joking and we moved on."
18yxq4x,Depression,2024-01-05,I feel like I’m slipping,When I say I feel like I’m slipping I don’t mean physically but mentally. And sometimes the mental slipping goes so far I wanna hurt myself physically. I don’t know how to speak for if I did all it would make me feel is weak. Weak from pressure weak from judgment weak from not knowing if I’ll ever experience real enjoyment. So now I speak from the heart I speak my truth so if I gotta be honest it has to be with you. So when I say I’m okay everyday just know it’s prolly a lie I tell everyone including myself but in this bed that I lie. In the bed where I cry this bed where I scream in this bed where the pain makes me wanna die. But I can’t for I have so many loved ones that I’m afraid that I would lose some. So here in life I will stay here I will pray for it to get better for not just me but everyone else as Ik everyone hides behind a fake smile to make it seem like it was all worth while but that’s just not really my style. So if you’re reading this then trust even though how much it hurts I’ll never let my bubble burst. For I have life to live and so much to give that I would be damn if it went to waste so here I’m telling you this probably not to your face. But we all live in the life that’s like a race that some of us are trying to escape but with no faith. So what I’m trying to say was today was not a good day but we still made it through the day.  (so here if you read this just know I’m ok and dw)

Want to use youtube  negative overstimulation. 

Tech too ubiquitous. Like life fundamentally changing. All you can do is try to adapt. 

Isolation cant really do much due to expected workload and don't ever really think of a social hobby. I suppose I'm being kinda silly saying there's nothing, but on a practical level there isnt really. 

Just stuck in toxicity kinda.

18yxgi9,Depression,2024-01-05,I don't get it.,"M24, I am genuinely asking how people keep going? What is there to life that I am missing? For as long as i can remember i have been unhappy and unfulfilled. The only reason i didn't give up and take that final step is because there were always goals to aim for. Not goals i personally wanted to achieve but ones that we are told matter. Move out, Go to university, See the world, get a job. After achieving all of these things i still have that emptiness that lack of enjoyment of really anything, I hate work, I hate effort i dont get any joy out of doing really anything. I would rather not exist than to continue with putting effort into things. I still have this level of self preservation that prevents me doing anything drastic but im close to pushing past this. I have never really found any gender attractive and every sexual experience i have had has been disappointing or enjoyable. I have never felt the urge of love or significant attraction. I have a decent job but i mainly save my money as i dont really feel the urge to buy anything. Most of the time i just mindlessly play video games to occupy my time. I dont understand it, What is it that keeps everyone going? I feel like a therapist would tell me im just broken because that is truly the way i feel. Like the joy part of my brain didn't grow in. I have tried a lot of things in a desperate attempt to feel just an ounce of happiness but its all futile. I dont belive im a complete immediate suicide risk, I would much rather just fall asleep and never wake up. Like i dont want to exist anymore rather than the messy reality of death. "
18yxdq8,Depression,2024-01-05,I can't stand feeling low anymore.,"Lately I've been feeling relatively happy with my life but I keep sinking back down to feeling like shit. It always happens when I start feeling lonely and this awful feeling creeps over me and I start to feel so isolated from the whole world. The main thing I always think back to is a friend who ended up ghosting me and I just know it's all my fault. I feel like people can't stand me or something because I get clingy due to being so alone the majority of my life, I'm so scared of people leaving me that I want to be the most helpful and useful person for anyone but I guess I'm just being a nuisance and drive everyone away. Honestly the only way I see my life ending is with a gun in my mouth because I'm terrified of losing people and being betrayed but I also hate being lonely. 

I know nobody is gonna care about this or me but I just sort of wanted to vent.. not that it even does anything at this point."

My whole life, I’ve had a set path: go to school, get good grades, have fun with friends in my free time. Everything seemed planned out and life just seemed to make sense, it was easy. Since graduating, I’ve been working for almost 1.5 years and I honestly like my job. For some reason though, my life has come to feel so numb, it feels like everything I do is pointless. I do the same things every day, and right now I literally have nothing to look forward to. I rarely see friends and never want to go out because spending money has started to stress me out now that I’m on my own financially. I would never kill myself because that’s not how I want to be remembered, and I could never do something like that to my mom, it would destroy her. But I cant get this thought out of my head that if I died I really would not care at all. In fact, I’d prefer it. I wake up every day and wish I didn’t. I’d never put myself in danger but I always think that if I just got hit by a car and died a painless, unexpected death, that would be the best outcome for my life. I simply don’t want to do this anymore. Does anyone feel the same way or could explain what’s wrong with me?"

Like all my cousins are married with kids and so are most of my friends, but here I am never been kissed lol I’m not attractive or rich or have a future for anyone to actually be happy with so I don’t even try anymore.

18yx2co,Depression,2024-01-05,My economic situation is slowly killing me,"I've been broke for nearly a year now.

I've only been able to survive thanks to the kindness of friends and neighbors, but it also fills me with a deep guilt and a hatred of myself for being so dependent on others. I used to be the sort of person that others could rely on when they really needed help. But now I feel like a burden.

I was able to earn a small amount of money through selling a small amount of things that I once owned, I even sold things I really didn't want to sell. But now there's nothing left that I can really afford to give up.

It's hard to get out of bed in the morning. I have no routine because I have no reliable way of making money, and believe me when I've researched and tried a lot of different options. The skills I've taught myself have also turned out to be mostly useless.

There are days when I don't eat. I am hassled by creditors wondering where they money is. I never have an answer for them, but they persist. I'm filled by that guilt too; it's only because of my previous credit that I survived last year.

I'm at rock bottom. As much as people like to joke about it being a ""solid foundation"", I am not clever or motivated enough to dig myself out of this hole."
18yx2ba,Depression,2024-01-05,I message the suicide hotline sometimes. I have mood swings that may be caused by undiagnosed ADHD.,"I think I have ADHD, meaning intense unexplained mood swings that sometimes seem like it comes out of nowhere. 
I don’t get angry, but overly happy or depressed. Its not like bipolar because the most my happiness / sadness would last would be a week max. 
Many times in my life I broke down crying for what appeared to be for no reason. I just didn’t feel good. It started since I was 5 years old. 

I used to message them when I felt on edge, but I didn’t understand why I felt that way. They would ask me what was going on, and I would think and make up an answer I thought was true or bring up something that happened or what I am thinking about. 

I also messaged them when I felt the urge to self harm with the tools I bought. I just like having self harm available to me. When I need to hurt myself its there. It satisfies me and calms me when im shaking inside and feel on edge. 
I think I felt so bad at one point, I went on adultfriendfinder, and self harmed deep on a live stream in front of 80+ viewers. My IP Address got banned. 

I message them when I feel like i’m going to kms, but a part of me believes im not going to do it because I don’t have the means, but I have a plan. 
I’m also afraid of death. 
I do know I can’t Drink Alcohol when i’m depressed because when i’m drunk, i’m just impulsive and theres nothing stopping me from following the plan. 

At one point I felt so lonely, I actually gave them my number after they asked for it. They called my number back to talk.

(other than my cats literally the only reason im probably still alive) No matter how many times my friends and family say ""hey you're good at art you should do that!"" nah im tired of everything i just don't care. Like my mind is so corrupted with thoughts of ""we're all gonna die one day so who cares"", like why am i trying and struggling so much, crying every day, for what?? And why on EARTH would I want a job? Like who in their right mind is like ""wow i sure love doing nonstop work on someone elses schedule for little to no benefit, being more depressed, stressed, and dying at the end!"" ?? I just dont get it. Why would i want to waste my days on this god forsaken planet working? But like the thing is, im also so damn bored i get sad from just sitting at home doing nothing. 
    I dont have any friends; things like video-games and anime, and art- even going out and seeing a movie or attempting to hang out with people- is so mundane and boring and tiring to me now. Like i dont even bother playing video games anymore to pass time because im like ""well whats the end goal im just playing this shit to then press the exit button, and load up again tomorrow- which results in either A. Finishing the game and repeating the cycle with another, or B. getting bored and exiting and finding another to repeat. I dont draw anymore even though i graduated in Illustration, because ive just lost interest. Its been years since ive graduated, stuff just fell through and my entire life is just a dull dot on earth. No convincing by anyone could make me change my mind or make me continue my pursuit in these fields, i simply just do not enjoy doing anything. 
    My mind picks back up and spirals knowing all this, crying and repeating, months on end. I get a new job, quit, cry, repeat. its so pointless. Like do they make retirement homes for mid 20 y/o people? And whats even sadder, i feel like im almost so far gone I can't even shed a single tear for stuff that used to make me extremely upset and cry- nowadays i say ""whats the point"" in crying, or getting upset either, it's like i just feel nothing at all, im completely numb. Nowadays i see other people arguing i roll my eyes and look the other way like how could you care about something so meaningless? this applies to basically any topic for me... Also, i hate going to sleep, i always feel like i should be doing something. I'll either stay up to 7am or just go to bed but going to bed im like ugh i literally did nothing all day (for the past few years) and its just a constant cycle."

I'm tired of struggling, no matter how hard I try or how much effort I put in, I'm always behind, scraping by. I'm so tired of pain and fake smiling and say I'm fine. I used to drink my stress away, I was hungover alot, but happy. Got type 2 diabetes, completely quit drinking. Been sober for a long time now. But why ? Why do I even care ? No one else around me cares. My job of 17 years would post my job before my body is cold. Why fight and take hands full of meds just to feel worse then I ever have ? So I guess 24 is the year. As of now I stop all medications I am taking, and back to my original love, alcohol. I just hope when I have a heart attack it's in my sleep. I've had one already, there scary as hell, my doctor wanted to runn 5,000 tests i dont have time or money for. Didn't tell anyone that lives with me, dont think they would care, other then not having a ride. If I write out a note of how my stuff is to be used is it legal ? Good luck to everyone, bottoms up."
18ywn10,Depression,2024-01-05,"I'm severely depressed but live in Florida, USA","I need to get out of this state and find real mental health help. I've tried to kill myself before, and failed. I know that the USA is fucked in general in regards to mental health, but there are quite a few states that are slightly less horrible than Florida. It takes weeks/months to get in with a therapist or doctor, and in terms of emergency help, there is none that actually helps--they just put you in an institution for 72 hours and don't even give you counseling or any sort of after-care resources. I'm tired of going through the ringer and getting treated terribly because I'm mentally ill. I do have a car and a credit line of about $5000-ish left, so if need be, I can travel to and pay for a program and live our of my car. I just need help with suggestions on who to contact or ideas on what next to do. Sorry if this is taking away resources from people who need it more than me, but I'm tired of being guilted for needing help, so please be nice. If you don't have any suggestions, please don't criticize me :( just ignore me like everyone else who doesn't care"
18ywkmz,Depression,2024-01-05,Passions and life,"I’m going to keep this short and simple since I’m certain there are many people like me in this current predicament. I went through a breakup two months ago, and it still hurts, but I expected it to still hurt. I’m 20 and I’ve also found that I strongly dislike what my major is, and as for the rest of life I just feel depressed and I have no passion for anything. I haven’t really been trying to drastically change my life just because I don’t really know what I want in life right now other than to not feel depressed. If anyone can share if they’ve been through the journey, are in the journey, or are straight up starting the journey of this type of recovery and finding oneself I’d appreciate it greatly 🙏.

I had a lot of friends back in my home country but I've never had a boyfriend. I moved about a year ago and I thought I'd make friends and have a partner by now but that hasn't happened. I have tried but most people I socialize with just aren't that interested. I kinda feel like I'm missing out and running out of time. The older I get, the harder I think it'll become. I also have a chronic illness which is unpredictable so I fear I might never experience anything romantic or the typical university fun. I've been thinking about this a lot and it has been affecting my mental health, along with other factors in my life. Just needed to vent ig."
18ywb5g,Depression,2024-01-05,Depression and the gym,"I've been through several successful bulk and cut phases, and so far meal prepping has helped save time. However, after having a major depressive phase in my life and completely uprooting my passion for fitness and a healthy lifestyle, I have recently returned to my journey. Unlike most people experiencing depression, I did not lose weight. I put on a significant amount of fat during the period as I tend to binge-eat to drown my emotions a lot. Everything in my life was going to shit—absolutely everything. When I started getting back into meal prepping, I would over-order groceries and waste a lot of food because I had to stay under my calories, but this would just leave me feeling very guilty and dissatisfied. Knowing that this is something I want to do, I changed my approach. Instead of meal prepping, I focused on having easy-to-make meals in my arsenal. But most importantly, I gave myself choice. Cutting can be incredibly challenging for many, and it's very important to ensure you're not making this any harder for yourself. So, at any given time, I have 4-5 different things I can choose from, all of which would meet my caloric and macro goals. This has been an incredibly hard journey for me, and I have musterd up the courage to finally go to the gym again this week. I hope this post can help anyone fighting with mental health challenges or even motivation problems to ensure you that there is a way out. Keep on fighting, nothing can beat you down, buddy."

This isn’t new I’ve felt like this for the past couple months (in all honesty years, but college was a bit easier because I had my hand held the whole way with required homework and everything). But christmas was meant to be a change for me when I was gonna catch up on all of my work over the first semester but now I have exams in a week and I know nothing. I’ve realised this isn’t going to ever change I’m gonna keep spending every day not eating or doing anything then I’m gonna spend all night not sleeping unless I really make a change. I’m not quite sure what medication such as antidepressants do but if I don’t change anything soon I’ll be kicked out of uni and basically my life will be over.

I have zero motivation to do anything the anhedonia is killing me.

18yvoeg,Depression,2024-01-05,I'm only here for my cat and I wish I could talk like a normal human being.,"my cat for the past few years has been one of my biggest reasons of staying alive. her name is Daisy.

she's the sweetest thing on earth.
 I swear sometimes she knows when I'm suicidal, she has times where she has follows me around the house and other times where I'm depressed and laying in bed she will stay at the end of the bed or come and cuddle me till I feel better.

I've never been able to actually go through with an attempt because she's always in my room with me or scratching at my door to be let in.

I know she's just a cat but and probably doesn't understand much but I don't want her to see me committing suicide or eventually walk into my room and see my dead body.
she's a very old cat and I've had her since I was younger so when she dies I'm most likely going to end it all.

but as of late I've been feeling numb and I just want to die.
I can't see a future for myself.
I've tryed asking my mother for a therapist multiple times but she's never got me one despite saying yes. It hurts more than out right just saying no.
she gave me hope and then just crushed it.

I really want a therapist for multiple reasons of course but one of the biggest reasons Is I can't talk.

I've sobbed over this subject late at night for years because I just can't do it and I don't know why. 

when I go to school I just go completely mute and it almost hurts to force myself to speak. I really do try my best to speak and when I can it never lasts more than a sentence or two before not being able to again.

it's just somthing at school that makes me shut down and I can't talk nor do school work and teachers get frustrated with me for it.

i don't even have the awnser for why I'm like this.
everyone keeps nagging me for the awnser but I always say

 'i don't know'

 and they get upset at me because I always say 'I don't know' and they would reaspond with ''I don't know isn't a real awnser.'

 my parents think it's simple and to just speak but it's not that simple.

 i don't even know how to explain it.
somtimes when I speak I stutter alot and I get really suicidal and nit pick at everything I said and it's so draining.

my mother keeps saying how I'm going to do anything in my life like get a job or do anything if I can't speak. 

no one will help me and I don't know what to do anymore I wish I was just normal.

 I've always been a shy since I was younger.
i was always told I'd grow out of it but I never did, infact it's only gotten worse.

i can only talk when i have a friend with me other than that I can't speak and the worst thing is the only friends I have now are people online so I basically can't even make friends in real life and no one is going to just talk to a mute person because that's probably boring right?

like I'm going to go no where in my life and I genuinely don't know what to do.
I've thought of maybe learning sign language but let's be honest there's not alot of other people you meet in real life who really even know it.

I don't know how to fix this without professional help.

I've tryed speaking to my mom about it alot of it was trying to hold back tears and keeping my voice steady and I asked if I could get on some sort of meds or somthing like that and she looked at me like I was insane she said somthing alone the lines of 'do you really need/want meds to speak"" and just the tone she said it in sounded made it sound like it was a bad thing and my feelings felt dismissed so all the courage I had to ask for help just crumbled and I shook my head no

I thought that maybe there was some hope because she did say yes to a therapist so I felt happy and proud of myself for asking for help and that I'd maybe would be able to finially be free and actually make some progress on this debilitating issue I've had for so many years
 but she never did anything she'd always used the excuse of 'I don't know where to go or what doctor to go to"" and I told her to maybe asked our doctor to recommend us to someone or to just Google it and she never did.

I felt like she never even put in the effort and just didn't care and it hurts alot. Even the school counselor said they could recommend me to someone and they even suggested it to my mother and said it would help me alot but she never did anything and she's known I'd been shy since I was a five and now I'm seventeen so you'd think Id grow out of it by now but I haven't.

I feel so abandoned and neglected by her I just wish she would try to help.
i cry at night wondering what the fuck I'm going to do with my life because I just can't do somthing as simple as speaking and I think that maybe it would be best for me if I just killed myself.

not being able to talk like everyone else feels so lonely. i feel like I'm the only one who's ever had a problem as dumb as this and I don't know what to do.
 it's so stressful thinking about the future because of it.

 it makes me feel so hopeless.
i wish I could be like everyone else and just talk.
i wish I knew what was wrong with me and how to fix it. I feel like the only option I have left is to just die because my mom doesn't care enough to help.

my mom always uses the excuse to teachers that it was because I was more sheltered than other kids because she had cancer when i was 6 - 12 I don't even remember anyone comforting me when I was a kid when she had cancer but she's recovered now from lung and kidney cancer now which I'm greatful for.
I don't know if thats where my speaking issue stemmed from or not. it could also be because I've been bullied but I'm still not sure what the exact cause is because I've been through alot of emotional abuse in my life.

I would really really love to stay on earth and be alive because I'm going to see my online friend next year in person but I've started to wonder if being alive is really even worth it anymore"
18yvb7p,Depression,2024-01-05,i want to stay asleep.,"I just wanted to say this to at least someone because I feel like a burden if i talk about it to my friends or family but I just want to stay asleep forever.
it’s 6pm right now and i’ve been sleeping on and off all day since 9am. if i stay asleep then the dark thoughts can’t get to me and the pain stops. as soon as i wake up the spiraling thoughts start all over again. i just want to stay asleep forever that way i don’t have to be in pain anymore. as soon as the thoughts start rushing in, so do the tears. and i’m just so tired and over it all. i have work tomorrow so unfortunately i’ll have to be away all day for that."
18yvaym,Depression,2024-01-05,Feeling a void for a while now,"For a long time now I felt pretty decently shitty, I try to always do things to make myself feel better”happier” but always seems futile. I wake up with this empty feeling and like I have to put on this facade to show to myself it’s still worth going though life. My job rn is ok and I’m seeking to pursue a better one but I first I have to get an internship which seems like such a struggle to me. Everyday feels like I’m wasting time if I’m not somehow progressing my life and it also seems so hard to take those steps to really do so. 

Everyday it feels like I need to be in something to make it through the day, whether that be weed or shrooms or just something to keep me from feeling like pure shit for just existing. I’m not too sure what to do anymore. I really care my friends and I think of them all the time but I know I can’t have their constant attention to ignore how I’m feeling they have their own lives. A relationship seems like a far off idea, dating apps have proved useless with matching with people but it going no where. Either we say two sentences or they unmatch me after 5 minutes. Trying to pursue in real life feels like such a hassle too and while I am very physically fit and decently attractive enough to get compliments, I feel as ppl just like to “look” at me rather then really know me. 

Wanting to focus on my future seems like this impossible challenge I can’t even dream of doing when it feels like I’m just existing. I don’t want to blame anyone for my issues and problems but my mind always go to this hateful and sad place. 

I hope maybe putting this down for people to see can help even a little and maybe even help others and make a friend or two in the process

18yv9qi,Depression,2024-01-05,What to do when I don't even have the will to live? Should I take a break?,"It's been rough the past few days. All I've been doing is staying in my room and watching shows. I feel like everyone is moving, at least walking. And I've only been sleeping. Sometimes when I get sick, I have a fear that I might be split from my family. Yesterday I was so sick, but I didn't even bother. I feel like that's scarier, the fact that I don't even care if I happen to be gone and I don't feel sad about it.

I just want to know what can I do. It's going to be a really long month. It's technically semester break, and knowing that I'm afraid I'm just going to be a potato. I've known to withdrawn, but I feel like I'm going to be left behind. Should I take a break from the world and postpone my undergrad thesis? (And possibly feeling bad because all my friends are already graduated)"
18yv5jx,Depression,2024-01-05,what do i do.,"I’ve struggled with depression and severe anxiety for around 9 years now, and i feel that i’m running out of options. Ive tried various medications and therapists, but nothing seems to make it stop. I can’t make any friends, and my family doesn’t talk about feelings. I don’t have anyone to turn to, so I thought maybe someone here could help somehow? I don’t know. I feel like I’m doomed and at my last resort options."
18yv5j4,Depression,2024-01-05,I'm 26 and don't know what to do anymore,"To begin with I'm an only child who grew up in a loving home with my mom, grandparents, and uncle. I had a normal childhood until about 2005 when my uncle went to prison in a different state and mom met my stepdad I noticed her attention was more on him so I began spending more time with my best friend whose family was like a second family to me. Then in 2006 my mom and stepdad married and we moved to the next town over, that's when it started crashing down, I was the new weird kid coming into a new school halfway through the school year in 4th grade, I couldn't make friends and I barely saw my best friend, my stepdad barely worked and I wasn't allowed to leave our tiny yard when I went out to play, then I was barely allowed to leave my room and this continues until 8th grade when I was about 12. This is when a couple of the popular girls in class start talking to me more than often and I thought nothing of it, turns out they were just using me to get free stuff, that destroyed any self esteem and self confidence I had which affects me to this day. To begin 9th grade I moved back in with my grandparents and I thought It would be great because I can see my best friend more only for him to move to a town 70 miles away and that's when we drifted apart. Then came the relentless bullying in school from students and staff, it got to the point were I had my first suicide attempt that no one in my family knows about, when that failed I started self harming and it continues until my senior year when my grandmother died because of a drunk driver, that's when I left school (I had enough credits to leave and still graduate HS). Then comes adult life. As an adult I have severe social anxiety from growing up and wasn't able to get a job until I was 20, because of this job I was able to meet a couple of new friends. Now we fast forward to 26. I'm 26 and have never been in a relationship or had my first kiss yet, I miss my best friend from my childhood, I have horrible social anxiety and self esteem issues and if it wasn't for my family who I all love I would've ended it already. Now my mental health is taking a decline that I haven't seen since highschool, depression is taking over my life again and I truly don't know what to do anymore."
18yuy0z,Depression,2024-01-05,Tip: meal replacement shakes,"I bought Rootana meal replacement powder because sometimes I just cannot get up and cook or even prepare the simplest thing and all food sounds bad. There are a bunch of brands out there and I think it's a good idea to stock up on stuff like this for depression times when you otherwise wouldn't eat or  would eat something unhealthy because it's easy.

My package just arrived today and it was so easy. You just dump some powder in, put some water in and shake. I got a cheap meal replacement shaker off of Temu (basically a giant travel mug made of plastic or stainless steel with an agitator ball inside).

It costs about $3.50 a meal and it's very healthy. Got all the vitamins and minerals, proper ratio of carbs and protein, and this brand happens to be made of good stuff. Good simple stuff, basically oat powder and pea protein. No fake sweeteners like most of these things have.

It tastes fine, like mild oats. The main draw is that now I got some nutrients in me and I didn't have to think about dinner at all. It's done and now I won't get a headache from not eating and worse health from lack of nutrients.

You can pretend you're an astronaut on a trip to Mars eating your nutritional packets in your tiny room."
18yuugk,Depression,2024-01-05,I feel like most of my life I was depressed,"People say “oh 2016-2019 were the best years” yet I was already depressed and was agoraphobic as well. I feel like I never had any good friends or memories while a lot of people have and I just feel so depressed and hopeless because as an adult it’s so hard to make friends and no one seems to have time anymore. 

I’ve given up. I feel beyond depressed and alone and I don’t have the energy to try and do new things or even attempt to go out and meet people. I am already medicated again and so far it’s no help. I wish to disappear. No one in this whole world could ever get me or even want to be there for me.

I have absolutely nothing to show for. People only a year or two older than me are getting married and I’ve never even had a girlfriend before. I don’t want to live anymore."

I'm really introverted and I feel out of place and embarrassed wherever I go to, I can't meet new people because I'm too scared of how I'll look. in overall I'm not having a good time for quiet some time now. so I'm asking myself could I be depressed? or im really just a lazy fuck whos tryna find comfort in a disorder i don't have?

I recently got a job and a side hustle just because I thought maybe it would make me feel useful even just a little bit but it doesn’t at all. I just feel like I have no purpose. I don’t have any friends or just anyone to talk to. I’m just alone with my thoughts. When I’m not working I just sit in bed and escape reality through my favorite tv shows.

I’ve been feeling terrible about myself and life lately. And I’ve been trying to think of solutions to make myself feel better but nothing works… I basically lost interest in everything I once loved doing.

18yugou,Depression,2024-01-05,I didn’t deserve to graduate college and feel worthless and regretful,"I (22F) graduated last May from a good liberal arts school. Things were harder for my class obviously because of covid - we had to go home in the Spring semester of freshman year and didn’t return til the Spring semester of sophomore year.

Still, even once things were back to normal, my habits and mental health issues didn’t change. The whole way through school, I barely did a teaching internship where I learned nothing and had to leave early. I half assed every single class, procrastinating studying and papers til the last second. I skipped courses frequently, and was late a lot due to oversleeping in my first year. I never took advantage of the school’s resources. I never went to office hours or formed a connection with a prof. I bombed my senior capstone - half assed it and didn’t get the grade I wanted. Meanwhile, my friends and bf thrived and graduated with honors. I also spent all my money on fast food, watch netflix with my free time, and kept one friend while the other dropped out. Total screw up. I just can’t get over it, it makes me want to kms. 

I feel like I never deserved to be at that school in the first place, and just went because I got in. I didn’t even know why I chose my major other than slight interest - not good considering it’s in humanities. 

Side note, people who have similar experiences and post about it I notice, always had some pretty justified reasons not to do well or put as much effort in - i.e. abusive family/having to work 30-40 hours during the school week as a low income student. I don’t have any of that which makes me feel like any anxiety/depression/low confidence/procrastination issues aren’t justified but rather I’m just lazy, undisciplined, and didn’t take seriously the money going into my education."
18yu9m1,Depression,2024-01-05,My girlfriend thinks I don’t want to see her,"I’ve had depression for a few years now and my girlfriend and I constantly argue about not putting in enough effort. I was supposed to see her tonight but I cancelled bc I’m just not in the mood. I love her so much, I can’t even explain. Of course I want to see her. But the idea of getting up and changing and driving feels like so much. She takes this as I don’t want to see her enough to get out of bed and drive five minutes. On the surface that’s what it looks like, but I don’t know how to explain it, because that’s not actually what it is. Any advice would be helpful"
18yu95w,Depression,2024-01-05,I don't think it's gonna get better so I'm just gonna lay it all out on the table for no good reason.,"I'm realizing that now. I have friends but rather than burden people who know me, I'll just post here. Also I think I have MDD (snuck a look at a guys notepad). I don't think I have to tell y'all this, I'm just scared of being a poser or something..

Since Nov. 28 of 2023, I was doing so good. Mentally anyway. But over the past week, depressions has been attacking me relentlessly. I chalked it up to some stupid shit like: ""Hah! I'm winning so it's trying to bring me down again!"". I was wrong. It doesn't have to try to win. It just does. I thought I won again to be honest because it felt the exact same way.

What I hate though is that I've somehow tricked myself. Whenever I get depressed now, my chest doesn't hurt. It feels calm, like the eye of a storm. I've literally tricked myself into thinking that things will get better because it doesn't waver. Even now. I hate this. Atleast with the old stuff I felt COMPLETELY hopeless. Now, I have this calm and it sucks. What sucks more is that this essentially means that I'm run by my emotions because whenever I get down or argue or some shit, I go back to feeling that calm feeling once it dies down. At this point, I feel like the depression is how I actually feel and happiness is a distraction.

I'm currently nothing and I won't be anything ever. I'm horrendously stupid and unattractive. I saw pictures of myself and I actually felt repulsed for the first time ever and whenever I do a task, I essentially turn into a fuckin' one-track minded robot that does things weirdly. I'm HILARIOUSLY emotionally immature as well. I prioritize being funny so much that even my tone of voice has essentially changed and I just sound facetious a lot while constantly making jokes. While I have friends, for some reason I want EVERYONE or a mass of people to care about me when it doesn't fuckin make sense. I also think that no one likes me and whenever my friends aren't talking to me, I get sad because I'm not the center of attention. I recognize how stupid that is but shit I dunno what to do. I'm a worthless peace of garbage and I'm this close to just giving up and becoming a stereotype. Boom Boom, Gang Gang! Atleast everyone will be right.

I argued with my mom today. Drove away to clear my head. Then I get back into town and the car puts me down twice. Second time is almost at a light. The cops came to help and everyone's eyes were on me. I held everyone up and in all honesty, I just wanted to run or hide or disappear or something. After that, it puts me down again at another light. I manage to get it on again and I'm rushing home. Fourth time, the car says fuck off and I gotta call mom. She tries to jump it and while she's there, I'm just in robot mode and I'm ashamed and shit. She eventually pushes it home cuz it won't crank.

Worst part of this is that this happens right when my resume gets sent in for a job.

I don't know how to do this shit man. People my age have their lives managed or and I don't. Either that or they fight harder than I do. And the things they go through are much harder. Hell, some of you are probably reading this and are like ""Get a load of this guy"". I know it's not healthy but I can't stop thinking that way. I'm simply not valid and I never will be. I'm just an idiot.

 I'm stupid, I'm worthless, I'm ugly, I seek online validation instead of venting to people around me like a dumbass, I'm a burden on my family, I hate myself, I physically do tasks like a fucking idiot, and worst of all, I lied to myself. It's not getting better. It never will. Not for me anyway. I'm starting to be convinced of it. Something's always gonna be wrong."

It’s been like a slow decline and I’m crashing rn.. I have this extreme need for isolation but feel this extreme need to feel loved. I cry almost every night but try to pretend everything is ok to everyone else. I’m starting to ruin important friendships by pushing their boundaries and I don’t know why or how to stop. I wasn’t like a few yrs ago. I have a therapist but I dont respond well to medications so I can’t take them. I want to feel normal. I have adhd and I find it hard for me to stick with a hobbie. I get into something and then I just crash and can’t stick with it anymore. So I don’t have any hobbies. I still socialize as much as possible but idk how to make this feeling stop. I was wondering if anyone else can somewhat relate? And potentially help with some methods you tried that worked for you?

And I don't want to, it just passes through my head sometimes and it freaks me out. That's not what I want, like idk what I want but it's not that. 

And worse, the one person I want to reach out to for support? I don't think he'll be willing to. Yes, he cares but it might be too triggering bc this is what he went through last year but worse. How can I tell him that I need support and I'm not okay? He has so much going on. I'm just tired of feeling this way. It's everyday and all I want to do is lay here and cry and just merely exist. "

But I’m in a deep depression since we moved to US. I can’t find job, I have no independence, no money at all, I trapped at home constantly doing house work (I literally have no alone time, like I can go to another room, but I can’t relax because I’m always expecting my husband will come into, or kids will ask for something).  I hate myself for this weakness, I’m not able to appreciate all I have. and I understand that it’s probably normal for adoptation period in a new country to feel this way. Just can’t handle it sometimes so badly. My husband is the only one provider of our family and it’s hard for him as well, and he tells me about, but there is nothing I can do with it.

18ytnw6,Depression,2024-01-05,sexual guilt as a teen,"Hi . Okay . I (15M) had a sexual experience with a friend (14F) in seventh grade. It was random and had happened after a sleepover. I always thought she was cute, but now I know I don’t even like girls. We were sexual, and I asked her multiple times if she was okay with it and she consistently said yes. Afterwards she claimed she thought I could tell she was uncomfortable the whole time but I thought she was just nervous too, like me, since we were seventh graders. We’ve been on good terms ever since and have talked very lightly, though not too often (we never talked much anyways). I know I didn’t do anything wrong, I got explicit ‘yes’s’ from her during the activities and I checked with her afterwards and she still talks to me when I reach out, I’ve been looking into sexual guilt, but I’m not sure if that applies to me? Is it normal to feel sexual guilt for childhood sexual experiences? I don’t see people talk about how being sexual consensually with their friends as a child effected them. I think it could be sexual guilt, which would make sense since I’m diagnosed with major depressive disorder. Thoughts?

More notes : It’s not that I feel guilty about the consent . I know everything in that aspect was finw . I just don’t know what I would be guilty for? I wasn’t raised in a super religious household? I don’t get why whenever I think about being sexual with her I want to throw up."

Im tired. very tired. I owe so much money to people and corporations i don’t know if Ill ever see the end of it. I haven’t had a real break im 7 months. The only solace i had was smoking weed and i quit that 7 months ago to save money and pay rent.

I put on a smile, go to work and pretend like im happy with my salary which barely covers enough money to pay my debts let alone feed myself. Nobody will help me the way i need it right now and as the days pass by i just feel as though i belong nowhere.

My ex kicked me out after my son was born, my dad kicked me out for getting with my ex before that, my two friends i live with are the only people that care and i can feel their patience getting thinner by the day. I try to be happy but i just feel like nothing matters anymore.

Like what happened man, i went from star student to star employee to running my own shit to being broke and homeless in the space of 3 years. And every time i pick myself up slightly and regain a tiny bit of that confidence i once had, the world kicks me down again.

I tried dating again, met a really lovely girl and i cant even tell her how i feel about her because i still have feelings for my ex even though i should fucking hate them for not letting me see my son for 2 years.

I missed out on being a dad when it was making me the happiest man alive. missed his first steps, his first words, his first teeth. All the things that i wanted to see. I want to cry, i want to just not feel in pain anymore, but i cant even process what im feeling anymore.

Sorry its a bit of a rant, i wish i could afford therapy, the NHS takes a long time in the UK. private sessions cost a lot and i can basically only just feed myself atm. Im so bored of trying to be strong, i need a hug, i need to cry and let my emotions run free. 

I feel like i dont deserve to be happy, maybe i was reincarnated as this person, who deserves misery because of sins from my previous life. whatever it may be i just wish i could pass on in peace, im not brave enough to hurt myself."

18ysgeh,Depression,2024-01-05,"It’s not my fault if my friend cuts herself, right?","TW: cutting, suicidal thoughts

I know this logically, but I really need to hear someone say it because I feel very guilty.

My friend likes to vent to me nearly everyday about how sad she is. Normally I can handle it, but sometimes it’s too much and I tell her nicely that I’ve heard enough for today, and it’s too emotionally draining for me to continue.

She has decided that since I occasionally need to ask her to stop, this means we can no longer be friends. She says she can’t be her true self around me, and that real friends aren’t afraid to tell each other anything. Real friends can vent to each other without fear of censure.

This is not healthy for me, which is why I tried to set boundaries to protect myself in the first place. I never expected her to break our friendship off because of this though.

She has a history of severely cutting herself. And my guess is that she probably is right now, after our conversation. I just really need to hear from someone that if she injures herself, it’s not my fault. If she attempts suicide, it’s not my fault. I feel  guilty that I can’t be what she needs, and I feel guilty that she said I’m not being a friend."

18ysakc,Depression,2024-01-05,"I Don't Want To Quit, I just Want To Know I Can Win","Things have been rough for a while now and consistently getting worse. I have a talk therapist but I don't know if going \*really\* helps, ya know? I have an appointment to talk with a psychiatrist this month which will hopefully lead to a positive exchange and maybe a medication that works for me. I have a pretty long and complex medical history, so medicine is really dicey with me.

I'm writing this today specifically because today was really bad but with no real reason or specific culprit. I woke up and felt overwhelmed and sad... about nothing. I have a shocking amount of nothingness going on in my life. How can  I feel overwhelmed? Yeah I have chronic depression (I forget what it's properly called... major depressive or something like that) and an anxiety disorder but it just doesn't make sense. I'm 19, got a GED because in person high school was too much on my body, I've never held a job, I can't drive, I've never been in a relationship. The worst part? I've never wanted any of those things.

I want to want to... but I don't. They're arguably THE most important parts of life and I have zero interest in perusing them. The beginning of the new year is hard for a lot of people for a lot of reasons, so I'm assuming what I'm feeling is a part of that. I dunno.

I don't like days where all I do is lay in bed and think of all the things I think I want to do but never do. I have games I got for Christmas that I could play, but I haven't. I have online friends I can talk to, but I don't. Today I sat up in bed and just let my mind run. Every. Single. Time. It ran to ending it all. I don't \*want\* that. But it seems like a viable and reasonable option... which is not fun to just have floating around in there.

I just want to know that things can be good but it's like I can't even feel the good. Like I'm not capable of processing being happy. It's like that Joker quote ""I'm like a dog chasing cars, I wouldn't know what do do with one if I caught it.""

I see other people my age talking about jobs and trips and careers and relationships and they seem happy. I know I should want those things but I don't. And I don't have a want that replaces them. It's not like I don't want a career because I instead want to travel. I just want everything to stop.

I don't know what I'm hoping to get from sharing this post. I just feel like last year I hit rock bottom and this year I got a shovel. I feel like no matter what things always continue to get worse.

I know you aren't supposed to compare yourself to others, but everyone does anyway. I feel like nothing I can do matters at all.

yeah.

\[Future me here\] I realize I didn't really ask a question or anything... I just kinda vented to the world... sorry. I guess I'm wondering if anyone else understands what I mean.

Thanks,

It seems I'm currently in an extra hard episode. I have a crappy work situation and I'm on edge with my boss. We were chatting today about when we will be out for appointments. I took this opportunity to ask her if I could do half day Fridays. I've accumulated so much time off (50+ days) and I've struggled to use it. I thought i was getting more confident and less people pleasy with this request in the fall but now I'm not sure. My boss's tone and attitude immediately changed and it seemed she begrudgingly said yes. I said I would be flexible and be in the full days for fridays she isn't there. But that didn't improve her attitude. Now I've been spiraling all day about feeling guilty and like I'm awful. Her reaction and my reaction to her are exactly why I struggle so much. I thought i was ok on my way home but the audiobook I was listening to got sad and my mind took it as an a opportunity to feel like shit again. Why are our minds sometimes our worst enemy? Its like life decided let's put some people in hard mode while everyone else is in easy mode. Its stuff like this that makes me wish I was neurotypical.

Still I sometimes get into an episode, and right now is one of them.
I live an above average life I guess, with above average salary job, etc. I even have a loving girlfriend (who's also diagnosed with stuff, not important). But though most of people would be happy in my position, I'm really not.
I think about what's my point in life, I don't have any plans, dreams, goals. Most of my free time I just watch something to get my mind on something instead of it being blank. Yeah, most of the time I don't have any thoughts, even when I'm talking, doing my job, watching something etc.
I don't understand why people are jealous of me sometimes, when I have nothing exciting or positive in my life.
I can understand that there are people who havw much worse situations in life, and that their problems are much more worriesome, but still I just want to talk about it.

i (27F) have come to realize after living for about 8 months in what i thought was my dream city/state that i hate it. for some context, i am from an area in the US that most people make fun of/would never want to live and i used to say and feel the same things about it. i wanted to live in a coastal town pretty much my entire life and have had legitimate panic attacks in the years leading up to my move worrying that i would never get to and would be ""stuck"" in my home area/region. last year, i finally made the plans to move - date, lease, etc. the only person i even really knew in the area was an ex that i dated nearly ten years ago who had become one of my closes friends and their family/a couple of their friends. he and i ended up having a huge falling out when i met my current partner (27M) early last year, so those friendships are nonexistent now. my current partner and i have a wonderful relationship that is still going just as strong as it ever was - he ended up moving with me and i love him and love living with him. i feel very safe and fulfilled when he is home. the problem is that he travels quite frequently for work, leaving me alone a decent amount. it has truly made me despise where we moved. i avoid doing certain things/going certain places for fear of running into my volatile ex, i'm at least 14 hours away from most of the people i care about, and we are stretched pretty thin money-wise right now so i feel guilty spending much on any activity/experience, especially when my partner is not home. i work my 9-5 during the day and my second job in the evenings, go to the gym, and sleep. my anxiety has gone through the roof and i just sit and constantly worry about things like the death of close family members who are in wonderful health, my dog who is also in great health, or my partner when he travels. i miss my mom, family, and friends desperately. i feel constant guilt for the fact that my career didn't ""jump start"" after school and that i'm so stressed all the time. it all honestly feels like a huge waste and the only time i even feel like myself is when we come home to visit. we're here right now and leaving to go back to our new place in just a few days and i feel like i am truly spiraling. i'm exhausted despite sleeping for 12 or more hours a day, i constantly feel like i'm actively trying not to cry, i genuinely have so much dread in my body that i can barely speak. we just spent some time with friends in a city close to our hometown where i have tons of connection and memories and also feel so at home, and i couldn't help but feel like we would be better off there. we have no community where we moved and despite feeling so sure that it was where i wanted to be, i feel so little connection to the area now that it shocks me. my partner isn't struggling as much as i am with it. he's excited to go back to our own space and insists that even though the town we live in isn't ideal, it's better than our hometown. he's also MUCH more used to moving around/starting over/etc from his childhood and previous work experience. it's totally not his intention, but i'm feeling very isolated in my thoughts about it. he's been looking for jobs in bigger cities in our new state that would allow him to be home more (which would be helpful), and while i do think that being in a more metropolitan area would help (ours is very very conservative) and would alleviate my fears of running into my ex (which i feel is a large part of why i'm so miserable right now), i do still worry that i will just...not feel at home. while out with our friends over the holiday, i expressed that though we hadn't really made friends yet in our new city, i felt skeptical about the concept because i feel like i have the pinnacle of friends at home. stepping back, i'm scared that i made the decision to move/have a new start because i felt social pressure to do so - hearing people constantly ragging on my hometown and the general area where i grew up, i'm scared that i convinced myself that making a huge move was the only acceptable way to begin a truly successful and exciting life. conversely, i'm scared that my mental health struggles are pushing me back into a box of comfort. i don't think making a huge move is ever easy and i'm scared that i'm gravitating back to something that isn't actually good for me just because it's familiar and comfortable and what i'm doing now is hard. i also, again, feel for many reasons that a move to a better city in the same state could help, especially with a potential promotion on the horizon at work. therapy (of course) feels like the answer. it's something i'm actively working on, but just isn't quite a possibility for me yet. 

i don't really know what i'm asking for, but it would be nice to hear stories from anyone who's been in this position regardless of whether or not you ended up staying where you moved, coping mechanisms in the absence of therapy, any advice for getting my brain to shut down, etc. i keep much of this inside most of the time because talking to my friends about it is nice, but typically just results in calls to come home and even though that may eventually be the right decision, i feel like their suggestions don't totally account for the full picture of how i could benefit from staying. if you made it this far, thank you again. &lt;3

tl;dr: miserable in the place i wanted to move to forever, can't decide if i should just call it quits or stick it out and try to create something meaningful. also my brain hurts and i would love any advice in general for that."
18yrzke,Depression,2024-01-04,I wanna attempt for attention,I’m almost f16 (this month) and I want to get professional mental health help and my autism diagnosis finally. Problem is everyone thinks I’m “normal” I’m directly quoting that word. I’ve been having a rough time with my mental health since I was very young but only my mom believed me and very few others sporadically. I wanna prove that I’m bad enough and deserving of treatment and actually unwell. My dad. (Who I live with) I feel a huge need to mask around him therefore whenever I suggest I’m not doing well he doesn’t believe me and gaslights me (he used to be abusive and still has some traits). Is there any way I could harm myself in a way that looks like a suicide attempt in order to get help when not even doctors believe me?
1911i07,Depression,2024-01-07,I feel dehumanized today as an adult from ostracism and ridicule I received as a teenager,"I’m 25 and I still haven’t been able to recover my self esteem from off the ground. There’s some days where my confidence is a little better than on other days but sadly still not enough to be able to live a regular life. I can’t go to the movies, I can’t sit down to eat at restaurants, I can’t go out for a walk in nature, I can’t go to the gym.  At the very most I’m able to run a few errands like doing grocery shopping or whatever other important things there are that need to be taken care of. This I’m only able to do when I feel I’m at my most confident. There’s times where there won’t be anything to eat at home for months because I’m simply unable to leave my home due to social anxiety. I usually just buy myself fast food and of course rely on the drive thru. Even then, sometimes it’s really hard for me to force myself out of the house to buy fast food even from just the drive thru because I’m afraid of how the workers might look at me. I know I shouldn’t care about what this stranger thinks of me behind the window, and I don’t for the most part, but that short little negative interaction symbolize every other negative interaction that I’ve ever had with people in the past and it hurts.

When my self esteem is at its worst, I often feel so embarrassed to even be alive. I think back on every time I’ve had someone laugh at me for something I may have said or done and even when I hadn’t said/done anything at all. The latter is what especially affected my self esteem the most. It’s one thing to have said something or done something laugh worthy unintentionally, you can learn from it. Ok, DON’T say that or DON’T do that again! If I avoid doing or saying that then there won’t be any laughter and I won’t be embarrassed. But when I’m already not doing or saying anything to begin with, well then what are they laughing at? What are these people who aren’t my friends because they’ve never shown any interest in becoming my friends laughing at? Just one quick look at me is enough for them to burst into laughter. Why? It’s clear they’re laughing AT me. They’re laughing AT ME. ME, MY VERY BEING. I AM FUNNY TO THEM. It’s not what I said or done that is funny, they aren’t laughing at that. It’s me. I am what is funny. I’m not making jokes here for them to laugh at, in fact, I’m not even saying anything at all. I AM THE JOKE. I don’t have to do anything wrong to be laughed at. I can do everything right and it’ll still be wrong. It’ll still generate laughter. 

It’s also the fact that I’ve never had many friends growing up. I wanted to make friends but couldn’t speak up because I was too shy. But no one ever really showed any interest in me. Not many people have ever said hello despite sharing the same classroom for years. This paired with getting ridiculed for one thing or the other by my classmates and even a few adult staff members has completely decimated any self confidence I may have had. Even 7 years after I graduated from high school, I still worry about people laughing at me or finding me strange. I cannot make eye contact with people because I’ve been told I look intimidating. I’ve been compared to serial killers and been joked about me wanting to blow up the school. Every interaction that I have with people, I am always conscious of the many things that have been said to me. I worry that they might be afraid of me. I do not look at them in the eye because I might make them uncomfortable. I do not engage in small talk too much because I know they’re not really interested in talking to me. I do not show any affection towards anyone that I may find attractive for fear that I might unintentionally creep them out. I will never make friends or be in a relationship because my low self esteem makes me feel undeserved of any of those things. It’s pathetic and even laugh worthy for me to even try to make those things happen. 

I just want to feel “normal”. I want to feel like I’m allowed to have my dignity and self respect. It’s hard for me to have either of those two things when people are always pointing out everything that they find wrong with me. I know I’m not an enjoyable person to be around (my greatest offense seems to be that I’m too quiet/uninteresting and ugly) but I still deserve at least the most basic and minimum amount of respect. I haven’t done anything to anyone. I’m still a human being that experiences real   emotions. I feel sadness the same way that they sometimes do. The real difference between their sadness and my sadness is that they receive compassion and sympathy whenever they’re down. All I’ve ever gotten was criticism. This makes it hard for me to open up about my issues and reach out for help.  I used to show up to school looking visibly upset everyday and no one ever asked if I was ok. I’ve had a school resource officer tell me that I need to stop walking around like I have a chip on my shoulder. And to think that an adult would show more concern and be less judgmental when they see a visibly troubled teen. I fucking hate people and it’s clear that they hate me too. I don’t feel that I have any place here on earth when it’s clear that I’m not wanted. I’d be surprised, yet unsurprised if some people actually preferred for me to be gone. Surprised because I don’t feel that I’ve ever done anything to hurt anyone, I’ve always kept to myself because no one ever seemed to want to have anything to do with me. Unsurprised because…well, people in general don’t like me and take issue with me."
190dt8r,Depression,2024-01-06,Literally everything is exhausting,"Running errands, doing chores, spending time with friends, hobbies, working, everything drains the life out of me. I start doing anything and two minutes later I feel like I just want to lay on the couch and do nothing.

Even the hobbies I used to enjoy and friends I used to look forward to seeing make me feel tired. The easiest tasks ever like brushing my teeth, showering, cooking, and driving are daunting to think about.

And when I do lay on the couch and do nothing, I feel like I have to do something because I’m wasting my life. But then doing anything sounds exhausting and makes me want to go back to doing nothing. It’s a never ending cycle"
18yrzgo,Depression,2024-01-04,I felt what it feels to not have this.,"I was in antidepressants for a while and damn, what a difference it was!!
But now everything sucks again.
I stopped my taking medication a long time ago, slowly sabotaging everything I fixed. 
My relationships are non existent again and I’m the best at pushing people away. I remember when I was younger people would reach out to me; damn I had people over all the time. 

I had a serious TBI two years  ago. I was hit by a car while riding my bicycle and I wasn’t wearing a helmet. That landed me in the hospital for a month and they started me on antidepressants. When I got out, it felt like a new opportunity. One that I’m not taking advantage of.

But as I’m writing this and thinking about my problems, I realize they’re not that bad. But they do feel so real. 

I wanna be a freelance website designer too and I’m going to school for that. I’m actually excited but I don’t know. 

My latest problem is that my bicycle got stolen. I use that to do Uber eats in my city. 
Jeez."
18yryr3,Depression,2024-01-04,I cant keep living like this,"I cant keep living like this

*PLEASE READ THIS*

I am lonely. My friends are drifting away from me and ignoring me more and more. They are starting to leave me behind. They exclude me from everything: it's been almost two years since they last invited me to hang out. I have known them for 2-3 years and I have known some of them for 8 years. I thought they were close to me, I was wrong. I don't know how to approach them anymore. They ignore me. I don't know what's wrong with me. Maybe I'm just different. My grades at school are getting worse, and I lack motivation. I also dont have a girlfriend, actually I haven't had a girlfriend for 5 years or more, I can't keep count of that... I wonder, how can some abominations of people have 3+ girlfriends in a year? Just how am I different from all of the scumbags in the world? I genuinely don't know how to fight this, I pray every night that the next day I'm going to wake up with my DMs filled by messages of friends that want to hang out, but nothing. Can someone help, please. I have tried to get new friends, and yea, they might be kind and funny, but I still feel empty inside. 

Fortunately, the thought of ending it all is rare. I can't bear the pain of wasting my life when I could do better, but simply I can't. I don't even know how my life got to this point. It slowly happened. I go to sleep late because I think about everything: loneliness, what it would feel to have someone that loves you, true friends. I feel empty writing this, and I feel empty while going to school every day. I feel empty when I look at my ""friends"" when I look at my ex-bestfriend. 

The most painful thing was destroying the relationship I had with my ex-bestfriend (female). It happened because of me. I couldn't control my anger. After she discovered that I liked her, she thought that I was disgusting, that we would never be a thing. I accept that, i do. Then we kinda got into a fight and started to insult each other. I won't go into too much detail like the cause of this fight and what we said to each other. But I really lost control of my anger. 

I hope that people don't change their mind about me after what happened with her, because obviously she told it to everyone in a 50-mile radius. I think I told you too much, but you get the point. Do you have advice?"

18yrvdw,Depression,2024-01-04,3 years clean of self harm,"Some people know that I struggled with self harm for many years, nobody cared. Even though I'm clean, I still think about cutting myself every day. I constantly have suicidal thoughts. I don't actually want to live for anything but I'm too lazy to kill myself. Honestly, I'm tired. I still go to school and have basically no dreams or ambitions. I don't want to do anything with my life and I thought that I'd feel happy seeing that I'm 3 years clean but I feel absolutely nothing. I can still see the scars on my arms and thighs. I'm hideous. My mother makes fun lf the time I was noticeably miserable. I'm still miserable but I just hide it. Sometimes I think about if anyone would actually care if I finally overdose on some pills or cut my carotid arteries. I even tried before and I don't think anyone cared. I'm a burden to my family. The first time I attempted suicide I was 12 and nobody ever thought: ""Oh, maybe she's not doing good. Maybe she needs a therapist or something."" But no, they all didn't fucking care. I can't sleep, I'm tired, I'm angry. I don't even know who I keep being clean for tbh but I'll try to keep going."

People always say that it will get better.. It’s all fucking bullshit. I constantly feel like I’m drowning in my own torment &amp; anguish, I feel desperate for a way out at times. I constantly feel like suicide is the only thing I’m even capable of thinking about. I have lost all my social skills &amp; I do not have any friends in person, from the outside I seem extroverted and well maintained but no one knows how bad I’m suffering inside. I feel like it’s all written on my face, I have always been asked if I’m tired or if I’m sad. I wish I could just wear a mask forever so that no one knows who I am or how I feel. I feel constant guilt for being alive, for feeling this way. I feel guilty for feeling like this. I wish I were normal and I wish I wasn’t such a burden to my parents and my family, I wish I was fucking normal. If I die, I’m sure no one will remember me, maybe they will for a while but after that, I’m sure I’ll be forgotten. I fantasize about suicide every single day, it’s the only thought that brings me a sense of peace. I feel like I’m just going deeper and deeper.  

Things will never get better.

I have been on countless of medications, therapy, even the psychward, you name it. I feel like I’m always constantly in a depressive episode, I don’t even consider them episodes anymore the way they last for so long, they last for months on end, every single god damn day I feel more &amp; more depressed.

1912llg,Depression,2024-01-07,"Dealing with depression,ocd,trauma, and questioning if I’m asexual",I’m an 18 year old male and I’ve been really in my head recently and wondering why I lack sexual desire. I would want to think the root of this problem is when I was younger 8-11 my brother molested me. I didn’t even understand what he was doing it was just all I could remember until one day it just stopped. As I grew older and realized what he did was wrong I started to hate myself I’ve always been attracted to woman and never questioned my sexuality until one day I started to have hocd with thoughts of the past I hated it and caused me to go into a depression. I thought since I didn’t defend myself from my brother it must mean I’m not straight I struggled with this for years and it caused me to have a masturbation addiction but I would only think about thoughts cause I was never really into porn. I would masturbate 7 times a day which I know is sick I would do it to the point where I would want to cry cause of it I would try and prove to myself I am straight after 2 years I finally overcame it and don’t have these thoughts. I still masturbate 6 times a day and I honestly think I have ED from it. Ever since than I feel like I lack sexual desire I’ll go to parties and don’t really feel comfortable getting with a girl unless I know her well I also struggle from anxiety and I get really nervous in sexual situations like what if I don’t know what I’m doing and what if I make a fool of myself or what if I can’t get hard  since I never get erections anymore all this has caused me to believe I could be asexual since I don’t watch porn and I’m not getting with girls like all my friends are. I’m honestly scared of the fact I am I wonder if I stopped masturbation it could help me rebuild sexual desires cause I can’t imagine a future without a wife and I would be ok with having sex as long as I’m comfortable with the person. I would also like to mention my whole family is bipolar and I have Lots of mood swings. I honestly don’t know if anyone would be able to answer this there’s so much but if you can please let me know I am pretty regular kid I still hangout with all my friends go to parties workout but I just can’t understand why I lack sexual desire.

I've become really good at making friends, I'm more in touch with my feelings and am more confident to speak them out loud. I went through a period of over-sharing a while ago but it honestly landed me some amazingly loyal friends. This is the most supported I've ever felt. 

I was very lonely until I was 28. I didn't really make any connections with other people. I had people I did things with but no real friends I could tell anything to. I'm a childhood SA survivor, victim of bullying, and a man who learnt to never cry. 

Is that why I've now spent six months crying at least twice a week? Is that why I've had periods where I wouldn't eat properly for days? Is this part of the healing process? Is it going to stop at some point? Has anyone else gone through something like this? 

My latest obsession is gender dynamics in dating (I hate being a man because online dating makes me feel exploitable because women get so much attention) and I work myself up to such a horrific clash of emotions and anxiety that I can't leave the house or eat. Then after a few days of bad sleep, haphazard eating, and ignoring work it comes to a head and I cry. For a little while I don't care about any of it and I'm able to function again. Is this a new normal? I'm worried I'm feeling things after being depressed and unfeeling for so long and now I'm discovering that who I am is a hateful bastard."
18yqvbz,Depression,2024-01-04,I was prescribed bupropion today,"Started seeing mental health a couple months ago and got a script for bupropion today. I'm hopeful it will help get me back on track to living life instead of just existing. I know that exercise, eating right, good sleep, sunshine, etc can improve mood and I wish I could do those things but things seem impossible when it feels impossible to get off the couch to wash the dishes. I have my fingers crossed that this will help me getting back to doing the basic things and I can stop being my own worst enemy."
191plz0,Depression,2024-01-08,Mental health support just makes me feel worse,"I saw a doctor today and expressed that I want to die, and that dying would be more effective than anything he suggests. And so he suggested doing some volunteering in a place I've already volunteered in before. It didn't help then and won't help now. I just feel patronised most of the time. I've got therapy and medication, it's not working.

I don't want to be alive, so surely the solution is to stop living. I'm actually thinking of an effective solution, but doctors can't help me to die, so they suggest a load of nonsense that we all know won't make a difference. I don't know how to get over the fact that I want to die, as it means all support to help me live longer won't be of any use at all, because I don't want to live any longer and I won't cooperate."

191f3gp,Depression,2024-01-08,I want to give up,"I have been struggling with depression for years. I am in my early 20s still staying at home because I have no job right now or can afford to move out on my own. My parents are homophobic to me and my own siblings don't know. I am told it's wrong and I will go to hell and God wont accept it. I feel like a failure having no career or money. I feel like a failure to God, to my parents, and the world. I feel like a nobody. I try to ignore my depression and hold on. I get so suicidal at night sometimes. I wan't to disappear sometimes and I try to stay happy and positive. I fake being straight for my family to keep them happy. I am scared to lose them.

I don't know why I am still here. Maybe what I am doing is a sin and I will go to hell. I don't think I belong or have a purpose at this point. I feel like I am barely holding on and going insane. I am dying inside. I don't know how much longer I can keep going. I feel so lost. I feel unimportant and like I am just here."

I know people say we shouldnt feel sad for things out of our control but thats what makes it worse for me.

I wish for a miracle everyday where people would finally realize the shit we live in instead of try to cope with it and fight for change. For a world free from capitalist consumption and exploitation, free from a endless cycle of work under poor conditions.

18yorzm,Depression,2024-01-04,Im 26 and have never experienced what’s it’s like to be loved by someone. Im wondering if I ever will.,"People say “it’ll come just wait!” But like how long am I supposed to wait… 1/4 of a century isn’t enough waiting? 

I just wanna know what it’s like to be loved and cared for. I want to know what it’s like to be thought about, worried about, or made a little bit of a priority. I want to know what being appreciated feels like. I want to know what being wanted feels like. I give SO much positive light to others but people just come up and use it to heal themselves then leave once they’re better. 

I feel useless or invisible or both. I just want ONE connection in my life that is genuine and my level of love, thought, and care is reciprocated.

I sometimes think my purpose is just to keep helping others, even if they leave afterwards anyway. But I don’t want that purpose or existence. If I could do it without making others sad, I would kill myself immediately. But even tho people consistently hurt me, I never want to hurt anyone.

I’m so stuck and idk how to get out."
18yoo7o,Depression,2024-01-04,"Man, seeing how successful my old classmates have been has really hit hard","I went to a somewhat elite school in the UK (a private grammar school). I myself was from a working class background and didn't fit in too well, (I wasn't academically very strong, not the best social skills, plain looking at best) and so I was bullied a fair bit and was known as one of the losers. I had one good friend from that school (who's still my best friend today) and a few others who I've lost touch with but that's it. 

I ended up developing my first bout of depression at 16 and dropped out of that school, finished off at a regular school, and went to a low ranking university to get my degree. 

I moved on with my life and didn't think too much about the first school. I've continued to suffer with depression on and off my entire life but this last year has been one of the worst. (I'm 36 years old now btw).

Recently I was feeling really nostalgic about my school days and started looking up everyone who I went to school with, and what I've seen has made me spiral so badly. Every single one of the people I went to school with are really really successful. Whether they are lawyers at top firms, doctors and even a director at the mi5, it's just really hit hard that I'm almost certainly in the bottom 1% in terms of achievements.

What hurts the most is not how successful they are, it's that so many of them stayed friends with each other, and seem to all meet up regularly like some old boys club.

It's made me feel so down thinking I also went to that school, maybe instead of fucking about and not doing any work, I should have concentrated and worked harder, made more effort socially and I could have been one of them as well.

I'm a failure in so many ways (gay with no relationship, only a handful of friends, spend most of my time alone), but seeing how successful so many of my classmates have been have really hit home that it didn't even have to be this way, I had such a good opportunity to be better and I didn't use it.

I'm sorry this is such a ramble, I really need to get these feelings off my chest. If you made it this far, thanks a lot for reading"

That's all I want to do, just sleep and never wake up, but I know I cannot do that. I have to try and be productive, or else the depression will consume me completely. I will get a workout in, eat some food, and rest, then I will work tomorrow and Sunday. I keep myself busy to forget that I am depressed and miserable. It's exhausting, perhaps I'll gather the courage to seek help one day, but for now, I keep on being productive. "
18yogsn,Depression,2024-01-04,I’m so done with life.,"I’ve never posted anything on Reddit before so forgive me if I don’t do it right. I just need to vent. 

I’m so tired. Tired of everything. 

I’m a 24F. I’ve never had a boyfriend, never been on a date, never had sex, never been on a vacation, etc. I’ve basically never done anything in my life and it’s making my depression worse each day that goes on. All I want is to be loved and to be able to give love to someone. I want to get married and have kids and live in peace. I hate the life I’m living right now. 

People say I’m an attractive person (even though it’s hard for me to believe sometimes bc I was constantly bullied as a child for my looks) and I don’t understand why it’s so difficult for me to find someone. I had a bad childhood and became depressed at an early age. I couldn’t enjoy my youth because of it and it’s part of the reason why I couldn’t date in high school. 

Therapy does nothing and I don’t take medication because it didn’t work for me in the past. I’m at the point in my life where I don’t want to live anymore.

 I feel like I have nothing to offer. I do social media stuff and I feel like it’s not going anywhere. There are so many things I want to do but I feel stuck and I have no one. I just want to sleep forever and be in peace. Is there anyone else who can relate or who is going through this? 

Can someone help give me some sort of advice? It would be greatly appreciated."

Maybe I am suppose to just not be there … like I don’t want to die or want to do it but they make me feel like I should. But I don’t think I would do it I’m to scared to do it.

191hy1v,Depression,2024-01-08,"I could be depressed, I just don't care","It's not going well, I'm 28, I'm increasingly lazy and sad, always having mood swings, I feel like I'm neglecting myself in order to maintain this 'status' of best friend, and I have to be present and available 24 hours a day, because otherwise I feel anxiety about losing this relationship, just as I've lost others. I am beginning to think that it really is a matter of time before I lose all interest in life. 

Sure, there are always those little things that lift you up, but they last for seconds, minutes, an hour at the most, then back to worries, apathy, sadness. I think it all comes from a fear of the world, a fear of having to grow up and no longer having time for anything, of not being able to give myself 100 per cent to others, of failing, of being alone, of losing importance, of becoming transparent, of not believing that anyone could care about me, of not being worth it, of being useless, of being exhausted, of having a too heavy mental breakdown, of becoming toxic.

I often find myself becoming anxious when meeting new people because I have the fear that they might 'replace' me, I think it is because of my lack of self-esteem and not understanding my value to others, or rather, I know that others think I am 'important', but I don't believe it.

I don't know what all this stems from, I have few memories of my childhood and they are not bad ones, I remember having to make wine in primary school, some petty theft punished by my father (and with good reason, I wouldn't do anything like that now), I remember that I was always the ugly one in the social groups, that when I had a crush it was better to keep it to myself, I remember that in middle school I often defended the bullied, perhaps I masked a lot of my sadness by becoming the clown, once I received a fake identity card where in the distinguishing features I had the always being the clown who lifted everyone up, it must be that clowns can be extremely depressed in the end.

I really want to dedicate time to myself, I feel I need to, but I am really afraid that in doing so, I will lose everyone.

I can't think of a time when I was really good menthally, I don't have a specific date I want to go back to, maybe my best time was when I had a girlfriend for the first time, I felt for the first time beautiful and with some reason to be liked by someone. After her I only had strange relationships, only one other time did I feel like the first but it lasted a fraction of a second. 

Maybe I developed social problems that gradually increased immediately after that relationship, I started to have many more insecurities, to have episodes of jealousy towards my friends, to be less cautious in making important decisions and to find myself many times regretting those made, to think and fossilise on intrusive and dark thoughts, to have possessive and toxic behaviour, such as discrediting people I had just met. 

As I became more aware of it, I lost almost all the toxic behaviour I had, but I was left with distrusting people I didn't know.

Since I broke off relations with my former best friend, everything has amplified, I resumed relations with what was my first girlfriend and we went back to being best friends, I had a few toxic episodes that reoccurred, it may have been the trauma of the other friendship, but I was transferring all the other person's behaviour onto her, and I was doing it wrong. Talking about it got over it.

In the space of three years I've quit 3 jobs, I can't handle the anxiety of starting something that might take me enough time and mental strength to do it, I can't maintain social relationships outside of my safe space, I don't feel like going out or reading, I just want to sit at my pc, listen to those three friends on discord, play video games and listen to depressing music at full volume.

1910ihh,Depression,2024-01-07,Ex Partner depression,"Hello,

My girlfriend of 5 years split up with me due to her depression, she said that she has felt unhappy for a while, we had talks around a year ago about if we both felt unhappy we would end the relationship. She split up with me and it was out of the blue as she never told me about her depression and how she was truly feeling. At this time, we had moved in to her parents home. I had moved back to my mums home after she told me this she thinks we are done. We tried to do it on her terms, see each other once every two weeks but this didn’t work, didn’t talk constantly. She went on a works night out, while I was at her parents house which was fine with me, she said she will pick up takeaway food and we will watch a film, that didn’t happen, she came home around 12ish, she doesn’t drink and I was so upset and annoyed and we had an argument about that, I understand from my part that was selfish of me to be annoyed and angry at her but I was so tired of the broken promises, that’s when she fully decided to break things off. She drove me home the next day, we decided to separate and go no contact. She told my mum she was going to come the Saturday before Christmas, she didn’t which upset me. The day before Christmas Day, she fully broke things off with us, saying she doesn’t want a relationship now, she needs to work on herself. I of course pleaded with her, there was many things I said but she had this wall up, I just had to accept it. What makes it worse is we have a dog and a car on finance the finance is in my name, I don’t drive, she has the car. We are trying to figure out what to do with the car as the settlement of the car is way too much, I’d preferably like to sell the car, she doesn’t want to sell it. 

She came to my house on the 30th December, it was like old times, we joked, we cried, she sat between my legs as I rubbed her back. We had to go see my niece, on the way there she said ‘if I’m better and happier and you don’t have a partner, maybe we can spend next new year together’ I told her I would like that. When we got to my nieces house, I made her go play with my ex so they could spend time as she has been apart of her life for 5 years, my ex cried, she told me she will miss me while crying. When we was on the way home, she started crying and hyperventilating saying she cannot believe how much pain she has caused, I said to her please don’t think that, everyone wants to see you better, you needed to do this for you, not anyone else. After we got back to my house, we decided no contact, if it’s to do with the car or dog she needs to contact my mum, I made a joke of saying ‘I’ll see you next new year’ but she told me not to put pressure on it. She also told me she doesn’t regret what she has done. During the time she was at my house I didn’t beg for her because she doesn’t need that now.

She has called me today, talking about the car then she wanted to see how I am, how I’ve been doing, she told me that she doesn’t think the medication is working as she still feels the same, she just wants the car to be done with so we have no ties other than our dog which we are trying to co-parent. During this phone call she also said the car has been at the top of her mind.

I have no idea but do you think she will end up regretting this, we had a solid relationship, we was best friends, she was/is the love of my life. I wanted to do no contact so she could get better and no have to worry about me. 

I kept telling her there are so many options we have but she is adamant that she doesn’t want this relationship which I have to respect but I don’t want her to regret it when I have healed from this situation. She is the stubborn type to not tell me either.

Do you think she will think different when she is on the right medication that works for her?

I honestly just don’t want to loose her but I have to respect her decision."

190v5rs,Depression,2024-01-07,"Depressed(I think?), Uninterested, Broke up with my GF, Built up Trauma over the Years...34Y/O male","Alright,

This is my first post ever on Reddit. Lately, the last few months I've been using the internet and Reddit to get answers to the questions on my mind. Usually I'd have friends to ask but things have changed quite a bit over the last few years for me. 

I will give you all the details but I'll try to make it short.

First, I was involved in a life you'd only witness in Movies. I won't go into depth but let's say I was involved in some pretty scary, unimaginable things to the average person. I grew up in the roughest neighbourhood in Toronto, I was around violence, witnessed violence and ended being a product of my society later on in life. Even though I had a great family support but unfortunately were immigrants and didn't understand me and my siblings train of thoughts as we were born in Canada. I ended up being knee deep and getting involved in Organized Crime. 

&amp;#x200B;

I hate to glorify anything of that life, because there is no winner. Everyone is a loser at some point. Some runs last longer than others, but that life brings nothing but death or a life sentence. Unfortunately, I met that day. I was shot execution style in the back of the head(I actually got on my knees and was willing to die because I was overwhelmed and out gunned with 5 individuals in my 59th floor penthouse condo). Obviously, I survived. In fact, Hospitals and staff named me ""Iron Man"". After re-learning to walk, talk, eat..I fled the city for my safety. I cut off all contact with EVERYBODY and ANYBODY. 

&amp;#x200B;

During this time, I found out my mother &amp; ex girlfriend(who was with me that day) got involved with the same individuals that shot me, and tried covering the evidence with them. My mother also tried to kill me by drugging me when I had no body function in a semi-vegetative state. They were worried I'd survive, remember and turn on the individuals that didn't finish the job. 

&amp;#x200B;

I know this is all a lot to take in..but It's driving to my point(s). 

&amp;#x200B;

So I've suffered through various physical trauma, but I also suffered the GREATEST to know and hear my mother's voice completely turn on me. She knew what was happening, and along with Organized Crime unit they were paying her to hide evidence, protect certain police officers involvement in my shooting and even incriminate me on stuff she has NO idea about. My mother knows me for running a successful business that I started on my own and ended up reaping over $200k in gross revenue after my first year. 

&amp;#x200B;

With the thought of this, the problems, the system against me. I had no choice but to move on. 

I started a life alone, I went back to working with people. I set goals. Things seemed to be better. Even though I was thinking of the betrayal, disaster, trauma &amp; PTSD literally 24/7. It seemed I couldn't sleep without the help of substances so I started to abuse my pain medication called Tylenol 3 after work to fall asleep. 

A few months into work, I met a girl I thought I liked..and in fact, she approached me and I had no intentions of a relationship but I guess the loneliness made me weak. This girl was a complete disaster. At first I thought she was just simply using me for a place to stay. Anyways, I found out she was talking to a guy she said she didn't anymore. Come to find out, this guy was giving her advice on what to do with me and it wasn't anything positive. Stuff like, why are you with him? why don't you leave? and only reason I ended up figuring this out is because one time she gave me her phone and I saw a notification with a heart emoji. I asked who is this, she said a friend..I asked who..she said same guy I argued with that I suspected was her ex-BF but she wouldn't admit that at all.  

&amp;#x200B;

Eventually my heart was telling me everything I needed to know. I can't trust her. I can't built a relationship with someone I don't trust or someone that has no respect for me. As a man, displaying respect to me is more important than throwing the word ""love"" around like it's nothing. It means nothing to me. So I ended up breaking up with her.

Now this has been eating me alive, 

She messages me, emails me over 100 times(no exaggeration) a day. Begging for me to speak to her and fix our situation. This went on for about a month until eventually I blocked her because it seemed the only thing she understood was her thought of ""I want to fix it with you, you're my love"", but she doesn't seem to understand my points of trust, resentment and how this would affect our future with me being the person I am. 

I can't get over betrayal or feeling betrayed. I will never trust that person again in my LIFE.

Which brings me to this,

She hasn't messaged or spoken to me in about a week and now I am worried; because it's out of the norm? I am trying to believe she's moved on but I also worry she hurt her self because she's threatened numerous times and even sent me a picture of her arm being butchered until I called the Hospital and had her held for 7 days for a mental evaluation.(I never was in this situation, I didn't know what to do, I was genuinely worried for her health.)

So now, it's been a week and we have no contact. What do you guys suggest? Continue with ignoring her and moving on with my life? Sometimes I question if I care or love her because I'm thinking of her and our good times. Even though the bad outweigh the good by A LOT, something in me grieves. Is this because I am lonely? 

&amp;#x200B;

Now my next point,

As I said..since the incident of nearly losing my life a few years ago happened. I've been alone.

I have no more friends. I have one person who calls me occasionally to check on me. However, at times I ignore the calls and even try to avoid it because I don't ""feel"" like talking. It's like a rock stuck in my chest and I can't shake the feeling off. 

Now, 

Here's again where I feel all the depression and stuff is coming from.

I used to make $15,000-22,000 a month. I used to drive an Audi RS7 as my main vehicle that had an MSRP of $158k. I also had a Audi RS5 &amp; A Dodge Ram Big Horn. I loved cars. You can only imagine what would happen when diamonds are given to a child.  I had a decent life. I lived in a brand new Condo on the Penthouse floor. I had a view people would die for. I had everything I would say I dreamed of. 

&amp;#x200B;

Yet, I lost it all after nearly losing my life. I retired my business, I got out of Organized Crime for my safety &amp; I was a cheque away from being homeless. This took it's toll on me. The constant reminder of the things I lost, the drastic life change..having nobody to talk to, nobody to confide in. The only girl I thought I'd be happy with ended up being a demon and caused emotional pain. On top of that, I turned to gambling as well. 

&amp;#x200B;

Keep it short..(too late now lol).

I wake up and don't know what I am doing. I've been on break for the last two weeks and this reminded me I have no interests, no hobbies, no friends, nothing to look forward to. I'm not in a good financial situation anymore and I'd be lucky to say I clear $4k a month after taxes. I never used public transportation since I was 17 years old and this is my first time. This girl I am telling you about, at least up until a week ago would message me to ask ""how are you"", but for some reason every time I read her messages I just felt sick. I just felt like she's so dishonest and that's why I blocked her because I didn't want to think about ""what is she doing right now?"" all the time. 

&amp;#x200B;

Again..I'm so bored. What got me to write this was being so bored and frustrated. I sit on the computer, stare at the computer screen(literally) and wonder what to do. I might type YouTube and watch whatever seems interesting on the first page. I can't seem to find anything that I WANT to do. I used to be like that. My brain would have 1000 things I would want to ""search up"" or ""read about"" or whatever it was..I was always trying to progress.

Now I wake up, smoke a cig, within 15 minutes of waking up I get the feeling of frustration in my chest and than I ponder what to do. I go make my tea, load the computer..and go to youtube. It seems like I am forcing myself to do this even, because by the time I get on Youtube I don't even know what I am doing on here. I've never been the person to stay home all the time alone. However, the last 10-11 months I've done exactly that. I stay home and don't do ANYTHING else besides go to the store to grab a pack of smokes. 

&amp;#x200B;

I know some people might frown on me for my previous life choices; it's fine but I hope you understand how life works &amp; the cards people are dealt are not all the same.

&amp;#x200B;

I still feel this post is all over the place..but hopefully with the details I've given you, you can make up what I am trying to get at here... 

All of these things over the years that accumulated have completely shattered me as a person &amp; my character. Also being in this situation with this girl where I keep telling my self it's over but feel like I am making the wrong choice because she's begging for forgiveness; doesn't seem to help. 

Working a job I hate, having nobody to talk to, nobody to joke with or laugh with. Starting to Gamble online to pass time &amp; have fun, using Tylenol 3(COdeine) to tranqualize myself &amp; my brain to fall asleep. Sometimes it feels the stress, pain &amp; boredom is unbearable so I'll quickly get dressed and walk outside to get some air; but then I am back 10 minutes later sitting on my computer chair pondering, procrastinate, and lose my mind to boredom once again. I'll play music to help me emotionally relate to, but that quickly becomes uninteresting after a few songs. 

Lately, when I get that feeling I just go to lay down...

Again, all this trauma/betrayal happened a few years ago, but since then I had met this girl. And since we've broken up, I want to say things have been getting bad for me. No matter how much she says she loves me cares for me or what not, I just don't feel it and felt breaking up with her was the right choice. She's too promiscuous &amp; she's displayed several times that I can't trust her. On top of that, she lies over the LITTLEST things. To the point, I don't think she realizes how obvious of a lie it was. I started to feel she was just simply insulting my intelligence with her immaturity. 

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways people, sorry to seem so softttt but I never really believed in depression as I've used the Gym or friends as an escape. However with both of those out of the picture, I feel I'm being eaten alive just sitting in my misery and getting a new perspective on depression. I am not saying it's not real but I've always attributed depression to the current lifestyle. 

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, really I guess I'm looking for positive words to help me push on. Perhaps constructive criticism on everything else to help me see other points of view. Do you think I am making the right decision by leaving a girl that confesses her love to me 1000 times a day after breaking up with her? Could I even just be thinking of taking her back because I am lonely? She's done so much damage as far as trust goes. She acknowledges it but I don't feel it's genuine at all. She's 26 so I realize how much more mature I am than her; but her age is not really an excuse for her behaviour. Cause I have met girls that were 21, 22 and their minds would blow you away. The maturity they had for their age alone was attractive. 

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways Redditors! Nice to meet you all!"
190rr3w,Depression,2024-01-07,how do I tell a teacher I’m dying?,"(I am well supported and receiving psychological help)  
As someone who really struggles with suicidal thoughts and behaviour, school is a big stressor for me. I am in secondary school (Australia), and my school is aware of my situation, including my year advisor who has been assisting me cope with school.

I know suicide is not the option or answer however when these thoughts arise I am not my usual self, nor am I thinking like my usual self. This results in me making bad and harmful decisions. I have struggled with attempting before and I want to be prepared in case I do it again and snap back and realise what I have done. What do I tell my teacher while I’m bleeding and in pain?"
190oj9m,Depression,2024-01-07,Family offers zero support,"I am having a tough time. I’m trying to make progress but every time I fuck up, (ie have a panic attack, cry, express a minor complaint) I have a family member shoving it into my face invalidating and/or shaming me due to my depression. How the hell is anyone supposed to recover if perfection is the standard? The self satisfaction I see on their faces is sickening.  I’m recently I’ve heard:
-take your carousel of meds that just make you crazier
-I can’t believe you’d be so shallow that something like that would make you depressed
-your kids are going to remember this and hate you

WTF. Does anyone else’s family completely fail in every aspect of being a support system?"

190hxcp,Depression,2024-01-07,Lonely,"Lonely isn't a strong enough adjective to describe all the nights. In the end, at the end of the day, you're alone in your own mind. Even if you sleep next to someone, the second they go to sleep or the second you. Both of you are alone. It's in your mind that everything begins and ends. First memories and last. No matter how many people you see in the day or talk to at night. In the end, you're just alone. I, I am alone."
190dgm8,Depression,2024-01-06,I'm so tired - I know I am not alone and I have worked so much on this but I have no energy to go ahead.,"I am just ranting my story. Please read if you feel like it.

I have been lonely for as long as I can remember. I was the outsider in my family. My extended family bullied me even as a kid and my mom and dad had no time for me. In school for as long as I can remember, I was always the quiet kid with brilliant academics and no friends. I had very few friends in school and they moved or stopped talking to me.   
The same happened in uni. I was always the wallflower, and by this time I was actively avoiding making friends because I was too scarred by the friends who left me. It was a cycle of avoidance and anxious attachment to friends. It was pathetic.   
Then I moved cities and got a job and thats where I am now. I am in a new city where I have no friends and I spend all my time indoors, I dont even have anywhere to go other than work. And I am at a point where I dont even want to make friends - the thought terrifies me. 

I try to connect with my mom - she is sympathetic but I'm guilty about making her feel bad - she must feel bad that her mid twenties daughter is such a failure at social interactions. I also go to therapy and have switched many therapists because I still cant solve my problems. I spend all my time consuming self help and trying to be better. I work so hard on my mental health - and the loneliness never goes away. I dont know what I should do.  

Recently I have been addicted to tarot card readings on youtube - just because they would tell me that a big time soulmate is right around the corner, just keep working on yourself. I am not as much interested in romance as I am in finding someone who would spend time with me and make my loneliness go away. But yeah, it never happens. And I am tired of going back to therapy and back to all the people who professionally help me with no progress. 

My poor self esteem and loneliness has taken a toll on my other life areas like health, academics and career too. 

I know that action will help - I know no one is obligated to help me and no knight in shining armour would save me - I just have no energy and I am tired and I know the tarot cards are fake and I am probably going to be like this forever. The thought makes me want to kms but I am numb and tired. "
1908wnf,Depression,2024-01-06,Self harm rant,"I felt good for 2 days. I was able to clean my flat, do basic hygiene, go for a walk,  read a book, studied German. Then happened today- I went into a spiral of all the fuck ups which happened to me during last few years and started to hit myself. This happened several times during the day. Now I'm  just exhausted, my forearms and thighs are bruised, hurt. I work now only 3 days a week, I wanted to work 4 from February but now I'll be glad if I don't get to mental hospital, again"
18zwe5g,Depression,2024-01-06,I think I've reached my limit,"I, 18(male), have lived a majority of my life being raised under a single mother and for a long time I somehow genuinely believed that everything I've been through was normal. I believed I was doing just fine and was strong enough to endure everything that came that way because my mother and by extension my sister had things much worse. However, I feel like I'm beginning to feel the mental strain in a culmination of everything that's happened in my life due to the stress that I go through on a daily basis, coupled with constant feelings of guilt, sorrow and helplessness. I'm barely beginning to realize that I may have actually gone through actual trauma, yet I have absolutely no idea what it would even be. 

I'm not sure if providing context would even help  as it should noted that a majority of my memories are very foggy, missing or are possibly diluted in some way. It would result in a very long post that I'm sure most wouldn't bother reading so I will keep it as short as I can. 

2023 has been a mixed year for me. It largely started when my Mom met another man and they fell for each other. To my surprise they went extremely well together, and for the first time in awhile, I saw my Mother happier than she's ever been in awhile. The issues began when he unexpectedly moved in. There will be strings of good days when you'd think they were a match made in heaven, then things would go downhill into yelling and arguing because my mother finally noticed he had a drinking habit. The drinking itself, and some of the things he would say while drunk were what normally started arguments. A basic situation. The first major problem popped up when we all got tickets to see a concert. A huge fight erupted and they broke up, my Mom not even enjoying the concert when we went afterwards because the day was practically ruined. They got back together but the same thing would happen with the next concert as a fight erupted because I was unexpectedly scheduled for work and the deadline to get there at a decent time would be tight. In the end, we didn't even go and the day was ruined again. This cycle continued towards every major event or holiday. Things would go well and then suddenly they would start fighting, almost the the day entirely. It happened on Halloween and Thanksgiving, but both days were at least able to be salvaged. 

Then Christmas came around. Christmas was wonderful as I spent time with my Dad's side of of the family. I was spending Christmas day with my mother and Grandparents. Cue first thing in the morning and they're somehow already arguing. It was over the stupidest reasons and I was over, possibly having a minor break down as I wanted to break everything in sight. They fought then he threatened to leave as my Mother was just getting ready to shower. I was fearful things would go to far so I had no choice but to stand by and watch as my half-naked mother begged and cried for her boyfriend to stay, constantly blocking the door and keeping him from leaving. I tried to pull her away because nothing was getting better and she screamed at me to get away as if I was some stranger to her. At some point, a TV fell on her and both me and her boyfriend had to lift it off her. I was then tasked with having to tell everyone to not even bother coming. They obviously knew something was wrong as I couldn't even contain how upset I was while crying over the phone. Somehow, the day was salvaged somewhat and everyone had a good time and was able to come over, but there was still a rotten mood hanging over everything. 

New Years comes around, and my mother gets upset because she slept in past 11. Somehow this translated it to be my fault and her boyfriends fault. We worked to clean the house and make everything better for the New Years, but it wasn't good enough and a screaming match erupted I was taken to my grandparents on my Dad's side because my mother decided we weren't celebrating New Years, and that she would just spend the rest of her day in a car in a parking lot. I even ended up in a screaming match with her in the car as she laid everything out that I did wrong, ridiculing me for anything that I would say and twisting it in every shape or way. Finally I spent a majority of New Years with my sister and her Fiances family until finally my mother emotionally blackmailed both of us, telling us that she would come home if we also did. It was salvaged I guess. 

After all these events I'm unsure how to really feel. It's easy for me to continue on as if nothing happened, yet I've been getting lost in thought as everything wrong in my life has been popping up again. I keep looking back at the vivid images of what happened on Christmas and New Years and fall in a low state. Today, I suddenly went into a faul mood at work despite the day starting off well. I was getting irritated and angry with any customer that slightly inconvenienced me, and I was just as irritated with my co-workers. Normally I enjoy working, and even more so I especially enjoy helping customers and being around my co-workers. I even fell into a state of paranoia and rejection because of a one off comment one of my co-workers made directed towards my work. I kept thinking that somehow it was over, that my co-workers don't really like me nor have they ever liked me. They don't want me around and never once actually cared. Of course, this isn't true, but I kept twisting everything to reinforce those negative thoughts. Perhaps this is due to never being taught how to properly manage my emotions as somehow something minor will make my blood boil while everything else is normal. I know there's likely a lot missing here, and perhaps there's a lot more context to be provided to fully understand my situation, but I'll stop right here. Compared to what other people have to go through, I feel somewhat pathetic being unable to get myself and everyone else out of the crappy hole we've ended up in."
18z3n06,Depression,2024-01-05,I don’t want to be alive.,"I put my trust in someone I care about and again they have shown their toxic traits that they has said they were moving on from. I feel used and manipulated and like my feelings don’t matter.

I really don’t see a point in life if it’s all just pain.

My aunty is very sick and that constantly worries me, I arbitrarily worry about my family dying, I’m worried about having no job, not having enough money. I have herpes too given to me by the person I put my trust in. I’m alone and I don’t feel like I’ll ever find anyone who can reciprocate the love I know I can give.

Worked to get better only for another problem to start or show up. Every year it's something. I'm tired of going to the hospital. Tired of giving blood. Tired of the bills.

18yncjq,Depression,2024-01-04,It is when you actually reach out that... you find there's no one to help,"Had the mind to overcome it once and for all for some years now.

Received therapy several times, but stopped in between because I felt like they just didn't care. School therapist wants to ship me off to expensive off-campus programs to make room for more students. Paid therapist honestly didn't feel like she cared too much, I asked for a material to explain to my professor about my condition, she promised but just forgot later.

Meds have been proven somewhat effective (just became numb rather than depressed, but also some side effects) and honestly I feel like my current psychiatrist is listening to me more than my previous therapists all together, but he's not a therapist and can only do limited things in this field.

Whenever I had my depression come up and need to explain it to the professors, there are always that 1 or 2 entitled bitch who just didn't care. I wouldn't blame them if I didn't know that they actually have a lot of freedom in accommodation of the conditions and are low-key violating the policies for our protection that had loose enough room to let them get away with it.

Everytime I step out and received so negative feedback from other people, I just tune in and step out less and less. I also eager to have relationship/friendship of some sort, but can't bring myself to know people because I'm just not that interesting plus I ghost people all day after all the things I've been thru.

I remember when I was 10 years old, I started to cut myself, yeah, at just 10 years old, because of the pressure my parents put into me, the screams, the insults, they are now stuck in my head, even in the single mistake I get a insult.

And when I was 13?, well, that really sucks it got even worse, when I was not going to school because I was feeling very sad, because everyone in my class was a asshole, idiots that I didn't like to see, I was feeling humiliated everytime I was on school.
My dad seem worried at first, that really gived me hope that my life could change.
Months later, he grabbed my arm, and started to punch me, making me bleed, and almost broking my arm.
That morning, I spent all the day, crying in my bed, because of the trauma, he sayd it was my fault ""Why the fuck are you always sad and not doing anything?"" It really hurts me, and makes me cry to remember all of that, no one was there to help me, it was me, crying, not sure what was happening next.
That time, it got worse, I was scared of everyone, I didn't even wanted to see a single face of someone, always looking down, hiding myself, not going anywhere, scared of my parents and family.

When my dad sees me cry, he tolds me to shut up, or else he will damage me.

I'm 16 now, and it's a very long story, now I've lost my only friends, I don't have anywhere to go, a simple word can make me cry, or even make me damage myself.

18ymnax,Depression,2024-01-04,Im incapable of being happy.,"My life so far has been a series of disasters outside my control. No matter how hard i work things seem to improve 10% and get worse 80%. 

Its like my life is a joke. Im a dude from a por broken family with wealthy relatives (literally villas and luxury cars) and friends who either had a functional family or money.

I grew up in poverty with a bipolar mom and a drunk of a dad.

My parents sent me to the best school in my locality. (Yea i grew up with elite or upper middle class kids) (Yea they couldn't pay for it after a few years)

ofc i developed clinical depression and developmental problems not to mention an inferiority complex. ofc i dropped out of high school.

I grew up an envious mess of a person. 

The only positive thing that happened in my life was me returning to clg and getting a job in tech. Did i mention i hate coding? But at least it brings money.

But ah! The story ends not there.
Now my mom's ill
Dads died before i even hit my teens.
ive come to know there's a risk of my retina detaching.

I just feel like laughing at the person who thought life would get better once he got a job. 

Ive lost all hope. I cant quit my job. I have terrible social skills so no gf.

I hate it all. I hate society. And most of all I hate god."
18ymk70,Depression,2024-01-04,Depression and heartbreak,"I've had depression since I was 14 or 15. I struggled with holding jobs and school work and felt like I was at the end of my rope a few years ago. Until I was 22 and met (who I thought) was the love of my life. 

Because of her, I was finally starting to feel better. I was finally able to hold down a job (though it took me a little too long to get there). Even though I hate it, I pressed on for her. As of a few days ago, she is now leaving and will not explain why. It feels like I have lost my co-pilot, who was helping me navigate this ""thing"" we call life. 

I do not know what's happening with our home, our stuff, our pets. I haven't been to work all week besides a half day yesterday and a bit today. I've had to couch surf. I can not sleep because of the anxiety, but I am so goddamn tired from the depression.

Now I’m lighter (slightly) and still hollow by now extremely easy to anger.,"I was on meds for depression and ADHD, they helped kind of, but they were expensive, and the help they gave came with problems like weight gain and emotional hollowness. So in August I got off of them.

Getting off the meds sucked, but after about 2 months I became extremely easy to anger. I was this way before the meds, but I feel it’s worse now. Everything makes me angry, everything makes me pessimistic, and everything just makes me want to die more.

I’m still over 300lbs although am dieting and have lost 20lbs these past 2 months. But I’m not happy about it. The reason I do it isn’t to be healthy, I do it because diabetes scares the shit out of me. I want to die, I want my fat body to kill me as soon as possible because I do not want to live. But I am forced to live for my family (mostly my mother) and eventually I will kill myself or waste away. But just the thought of Having to live with something like diabetes scares the shit out of me. 

I’m just lost, I feel alone, and I don’t think life has anything worth living ahead of me."

There is no such thing as a family that is safe from bringing upon each other the most soul-crushing pain and grief known to man.

18ylchn,Depression,2024-01-04,"When I was 12, I told myself that it would bget better. It hasn't.","To my past self,

You are so strong, despite how many people call you weak. They don't know you, don't understand how much you've been through. You don't know why everyone hates you, why they laugh behind your back or take advantage of you. But you also don't know that not everyone hates you. You have a few people who are friendly to you. Others will become your friend later.

You don't deserve to feel the feelings you constantly feel. Your teachers shouldn't call you worthless, your parents shouldn't ignore your pain, and your innocence shouldn't have been taken from you at 9 years old. You are so strong for not giving up, yet you haven't told family or anyone what happened. You don't fully understand it yourself yet. Our family still don't know and I'm sorry that I'm not yet able to promise you peace from it. 

You're 12 years old and already considering killing yourself. I look at photos of you and see how small you are, how young you are. I also see how hurt you are. How did everyone else miss it?  I want to promise you that your life gets better, but I'm not even sure if I believe it myself yet. 

""No expectations, no disappointment"", right? Just like you always said, ""Joy is not dead."" I've kept that alive by making it my username here. I hope that, at the very least, makes it all worth it.

18yky5n,Depression,2024-01-04,Neverending,"I'm 43 yrs old. I'm a mom to 2 grown kids and my only friends are my kitties. I can't be in a relationship anymore after being in 3 consecutive abusive relationships, 2 of which ended up with my exes being charged with attempted murder and serving time in prison. I am NC with my mom and her entire family after decades of abuse (physically, verbally, emotionally, sexually) and after my dad was killed, I lost contact with his side. 

I have permanent injuries from the abuse, I had to have facial reconstruction on the left side of my face along with rhinoplasty, and hand reconstruction for a snapped tendon. I now suffer from a TBI, trigeminal neuralgia, arthritis, a gooseneck deformity in my finger, back pain, and the list goes on. I don't list this for pity but to explain a bit of who I am and where this all stems from. 

I want to go out and be around people so badly but then at the same time all I want is to hide out and sleep and try to disappear. My agoraphobia has gotten so bad that I can't even go to my mailbox. 

While I sit in my room, I run scenarios in my head about socializing and even dating. The things I would say, how charming I can be. But in reality, I choke up. I'm so scared to make people mad, I avoid anything controversial because the thought of someone being mad at me makes my heart start pounding. 

When I was younger, I used to go out all the time. But I was also drinking and that gave me the courage to socialize. I wasnt an alcoholic by any means, just a typical 20- something. But now I'm at an age where I don't want to drink just to socialize. But I don't know how to socialize. 

So I just sit in my room, alone. I don't how these other victims rise from their assaults and turn it into a positive. I just crumbled. I used to be stronger but now, even I find myself pathetic."

I let people into my life and they leave when I need them the most, whether intentionally or unintentionally.

I wouldn't go as far as to say I don't need other people. The issue is that people need me even less.

The more people I let into my life, that's more people who will shit talk me and spread rumors about me behind my back, that's more people who will ghost me and abandon me for no reason, and that's more people I will end up missing when life inevitably splits us apart.

I don't have the energy to try and make more friends and I don't have the strength to handle more abandonment."

18ykcni,Depression,2024-01-04,People don’t understand,"My depression manifests as ultra-super-extreme-unholy levels of sleep inertia. When I go to bed and finally fall asleep, I just want to keep sleeping. I don’t want to get up for meals, for class, for church, for pre arranged hangouts with friends, for barber appointments, to give people rides when I promised I would, or even major academic events like exams that I spent days or weeks studying for. 

It is so fucking frustrating. 

I want to do all of those things. I want to see my friends, I want to get my haircut, I want to PASS MY EXAMS THAT I WORKED HARD TO STUDY FOR. 

It’s like there’s a disconnect between what I want to do, and what my body will allow me to feel motivated to do. 

It makes people close to me very frustrated. They make me promise them that I’ll get up and see them. I tell them that I can’t make that promise because there is a good chance I wont be able to keep it. They think this is the same as me just not wanting to make the promise. So they won’t leave me be until I swear to get up to see them. 

Then surprise surprise, can’t get out of bed. I call them to apologize but they just get angry and tell me I’m a liar and not a real friend. It really hurts. This makes me feel angry at myself, and embarrassed, and ashamed and guilty. I know that I shouldn’t feel this way, that I’m sick, but when people are mad at you for being sick you start to feel angry with yourself as well.

People just don’t understand what my depression is. It’s like not having control. If I am able to get up and see people (which is the majority of days) I am functional and normal and tidy looking, if you saw me out in public you would think I was happier than most people. Strange how I can function normally, only to fall into a rut and sleep for days and days and days without food or water or anything.

It’s a vicious cycle: I stay up late afraid to go to sleep, trying to be productive and setting up safeguards and obligations so that I have to get up the next day, I sleep through my obligations, I feel guilty and ashamed, I roll over and sleep to avoid the guilt and shame, I wake up and feel even worse about wasting the day, I roll over, repeat. 

I just can’t stand the advice and judgement from people around me. “You’re losing too much weight” “you just need sunlight and fresh air” “just use a better alarm clock” “try caffeine” “try melatonin”
“When I’m sad I just have a good cry then I feel fine again” “just because you’re depressed doesn’t mean you have an excuse to be a dick.” 

I just want to know if others are experiencing this. No one around me understands what I’m going through at all.

Thank you and happy new year."

For some people, it never changes, you can find love, be rich, have everything you have ever wanted but that pain is always gonna be there and it will always creep up when you least expect it.

18yjvxx,Depression,2024-01-04,Reflections on Hitting Rock Bottom: Navigating an Existential Crisis and Finding Resilience,"Today is when it struck me.  
It's been almost two months since I left the hospital, and I've come to the realization that I've hit rock bottom. Since my early years, I've carried a sense of abandonment, like a little child being dragged around without a clear sense of direction. This inner turmoil stems from the accumulation of numerous small events from my childhood, creating a snowball effect. It could begin with a young children sitting outside with his suitcase, forgotten and left unattended. Or, when I sought communication or reassurance in my own way, I was sometimes met with the response, ""not now, I'm busy."" For those who've known me for an extended period, you're aware that the first thing I ask when I call someone is, ""am I bothering you?"". It's a pervasive feeling of abandonment, of burden, and fundamentally, a sense of not having my place.

  
Over time, I developed a defense mechanism. I reject people before allowing them into my life, isolating myself in armor, fueled by the fear of abandonment and the dread of being hurt – again, because I am a highly sensitive person. Growing up in a divorced family presents its challenges, as one tends to adopt fundamental values from the parent with whom they spend the majority of their time. Recently, I learned from a psychiatrist that the way a child perceives their parent, generally of the same binary, serves as a reflection or image of themselves. However, when fundamental values are in dissonance, the child or adult struggles to perceive themselves authentically.

  
Those who know me well are aware that I've been grappling with an existential crisis for a very long time. Questions like ""**Who am I?**"" ""**Where am I going?**"" and ""**What is MY worth?**"" persistently haunt me. I must come to terms with mourning the idealized image I aspired to, driven by an unconscious desire to feel a sense of belonging, value, and love. Today, the realization struck that I've hit rock bottom, inadvertently pushing away people I love and losing my soulmate – my significant other, whose smile and company acted as a healing balm for my heart. Now, with my feet firmly on the ground, it only takes a gentle push to resurface. One day at a time. At my own pace. One breath at a time."
18yjoke,Depression,2024-01-04,How to get rid of ambitions,"It's like my high ambitions are only keeping me away from dealing with basic aspects of my life, which are in trouble. 

Every now &amp; then, I need a ""wake up"" call to come back to base &amp; be worried about solving them. Otherwise, I stay (over)optimistic &amp; more inclined to think about ambitions. 

I tried lying to myself about not being serious of those ambitions, but it backfires, making me go back to thinking about them even more.

Each wake-up call (incidents) are followed by a meltdown session, in which I claim all ambitions to be pointless, only to get back to thinking ""sky is the limit"" very next day

How do I get out of this vicious cycle?"
18yjnqx,Depression,2024-01-04,"Think I’m really depressed today, contemplating suicide.","I’ve been fighting with my husband a lot lately, and I just feel like I’m totally stuck. Stuck in a job I don’t like, stuck somewhere I don’t want to be, and stuck in a marriage with someone who isn’t right for me. I don’t feel like I can tell anyone about the suicidal thoughts because it scares them too much. 

This isn’t the first time I’ve sat alone in my office quietly crying in the last few months. I took anti depressants for the better part of 10 years and stopped taking them roughly a year ago because I just didn’t feel like they were doing anything. Lately I feel like the anxiety has been crippling, I can’t do anything without immediately getting overwhelmed or distracted. 

I feel like I care much more about my husband than he does me, I’m constantly thinking about him and how I can be gentle with him and I’m tired of feeling like I’m obsessed and like I can’t focus on myself. I don’t have any identity. It’s like I’ve always been in someone’s shadow. 

I made resolutions to be more positive and make happiness for myself a few days into January and I’m already back in this negative thought spiral. I’ve been in it so long I don’t know how to train myself out of it.

18yjet3,Depression,2024-01-04,Summer never makes me relieved anymore.,"When I was a kid I couldn't wait for summer break. I didn't have many friends and I often argued at some point with the ones I had but no school. Yay!

School is over. It's been almost a year since my graduation. I am burnt out university student. I need to study for my exams and I can't bring myself to do it. I hope I am able to bribe the professors that are stricter so I can pass.

Since 11th grade I've been working every summer. I was working in retail.Yes for the past 2 years. My first time was...Now after my second job(the same position somewhere else) it was better. I had a rude manager that was only rude to me. I must admit sometimes I wasn't doing things right and fast enough. Once she threatened to fire me. I couldn't hold back my tears. It was also my mom's birthday so I had no experienced individual to talk to. After that job I realized I don't want to work in retail ever again. Guess what? I couldn't find a job and I was working in retail again. Unlike 2022 I worked 8 hours this time. This shit drained my soul. I was grumpy and lashing on everyone. I was exhausted every day. Then I realized that until I graduate university that's how my summers will be like. Depressing. Working 9-5 for a job that is paying well unless you're working at the wrong place. Last year In 2022 I was paid more and I worked from 10-16. I felt used. And depressed because no one is appreciating you. I've only got either managers or coworkers that think they are bosses when they are in the same position as me yell at me. All of this for minimum or a little above minimum wage. My life now is university where I don't have friends because of my lack of social skills and vocabulary and working shitty jobs during the summer. When I start working my desired job at least the summer I will be free.

I am down to work for 4 hours but the pay is just okay. My mom says I should work 8 hours so I can be paid the most but I don't think I can handle working for 8 hours. 6 was okay but 4 sounds perfect. But at the same time  I want to earn money for my college funds so I won't have to fully rely on my parents and be a financial burden.

So is that life? Working hard, not being appreciated, being yelled at, underpaid, exhausted after work. Is that life? If that is life then I see no point in living. I decided to work a well paid job in the future and I don't know if I will like it. I mean I will work 9 months and I will be well paid. But will I like the job? Or will I have to settle for working all my life and waiting for the summer and other breaks eventually? Is life all for waiting to have a break? "

All downfall happened when I had to leave my birth place &amp; been living there for 13 years in Saudi Arabia (I am an Indian btw) , life was very good even doe I was introverted still but I enjoyed it with my family. 

But I had to leave Saudi Arabia due to taxes which my father couldn't afford and had to move to India. To be honest I hated India and still hate it no offense to some Indians reading this but I hated this place. Because bringing up in Saudi Arabia to coming to a whole new country. 

I went to India when I finished my 7th grade and now I have completed 12th grade and let me tell you the time period was the worst years of my fucking life..

I didn't get along with anybody , nobody related with me and I just hated everything. And I basically spend in the years rotting in my room.

Worst part was my dad was still in Saudi Arabia grinding and my mother would be with me most of the time but most time she flew to watch over my dad.

And in 2020 my mom said she would be back here in 12 days  and due to COVID passed a year

And I never knew depression and isolation existed back then now I need fucking serious help.

The fucked up part is I have been struggling in school and was bullied cuz I was a quit motherfucker 😭 and my parents thought I wasn't intrested in studies and went through some physical trauma.

Now I completed 12th and I want to move abroad thats my only goal. And my parents wants me to be with them but I can't. I want to fix my life , I want to be independent and I want to make friends and I don't want to be suffering


I am planning to go to Canada this year but my parents don't want me to go  there but I have to. And my older sister is there so she will assist me get a job and studies and help me guide me.

My parents doubt and dont believe in me but I don't give a fuck. This is my first decision I am taking in my life and I don't want them to put burden on me. Struggling by doing jobs , studying and making ends meet is way better than self isolation .

I am broken inside but I need to keep going

I am also going to take course on web design and development since because it's going to help me freelance and I will also learn some passive ways to make bread.

The thing is I won't be doing a degree because it's the expensive as fuck so I thought of doing a diploma 2+1 and a master's degree.

I'm a 26 y.o male, INFP, with anxiety and depression disorder. I tend to absorb other people's emotions and I easily feel submerged by their feelings, this is a huge problem in my life. 

For examples:

1- when two people I don't know are arguing in the streets, I walk faster because I'm scared like they are angry against me 

2- when I have to say my point of view, I'm too scared of hurting people feeling and I avoid doing or saying what they don't wanna hear (for example, it's been 7 months since I think about quitting my job, but I'm afraid everyone will be disappointed or angry...)

3- I stop to talk to my family because they got some financial issue (or other important issues) and I can't bear their sadness, their anxiety and it make me feel depressed

I can't stand my emotions anymore and I wish I could feel nothing... I already tried to becoming a selfish person, but it's impossible because of the sensation of culprit and the fact that I care about others even when I don't know them or I don't like them... 

Do you have any exercises or advice to reduce my empathy?"

I am recovering from severe depression and have been taken of meds recently (about a month and a half now). I know it's a huge step after being stuck in bed for couple years and I should be super proud... 
I am still struggling to get myself motivated to do some things, be it simple or complicated. But once I get in the mood, or manage to get motivated by people surrounding me, I feel unstoppable and can do pretty much anything that's needed. By this I am mostly focused on house work and such. 
I have a strong will to go back to the way I was before, to be able to take care of house and family. I wasn't really a lazy person by nature before depression happened. I was always all over the place doing something, ao that is what I would like to go back to with time. 
Talked to my doctor, she said it's highly possible considering how much I have recovered so far, and I just need to keep it up the way I was fighting till now. She also said to find a motivation around me considering the issue I have addressed, so my question is:
I was wondering how do you guys find motivation to do things? Like how do you get in the mood? What motivates you (except deadlines!)? 

Any advice is appreciated, as I really want to get well again.
Also I am aware what helps you maybe won't help me, but it's worth trying after all! :D"
18yhrs1,Depression,2024-01-04,"My life has no purpose. There is nothing to do. Im too lonely , isolated and i hate that every day im alive is wasted. I cant do it anymore.","Im 23 but its been years of living alone by now. Im on disability for cptsd and can not take public transport and failed to get a driving license. I have no friends and live in a small town. I have no hobbies. Nothing makes me happy. I spend my days sitting on my sofa or laying in my bed watching useless shit for hours upon end just killing time until i can finally take my sleep meds and get a few hours of nightmares before it all repeats.

Im horribly depressed. What sucks most is that i want to live. I wish i had friends. I wish i had a hobby that broguht me joy(ive tried everything and i hate it even if im not bad at it) i wish i could go outside. 

I feel like im wasting my youth. Just suffering in nothingness, getting more and more ugly and old and unhealthy. I hate myself more and more. I wish i could of at least gone to one party or rave before i die but i live hours away from anywhere that would be possible and cant affort it. The only chance i had i ruined with my own social anxiety.

Worse is with the economy getting worse im barely able to afford meds and food along with rent. Im going into debt with it all. I cant afford therapy anymore,( not that it worked)

Im so at loss for what to do. Im so sick of the isolation and useless way of life. Theres nothing there. Only these same damn walls every day every month every year.. and nobody but myself. Its driving me insane, like genuinely i-need-to-be-on-antipsychotics  or else i hear voices, become paranoid and hallucinate insane.

Its hard to not think its better if i just spare myself this misery. Its not going to change. Im too sick in the head to go on a buss or talk to anyone. Im too stupid to learn how to do anything usefull like make music. Theres no future for me and i wish i could just stop it all now. Im too sick of it all. I cant stand it."
18yhr1p,Depression,2024-01-04,I WANT TO DIEEEEEE,I'm so done with living. I'm 22 and my life's a mess. I'm 2 minutes away from putting a bullet in my head. I don't feel okay I'm screaming out my window I'm done. I'm done. I'm. Done
18yhmdx,Depression,2024-01-04,People's arrogance and judgment is something I can't handle,"Throughout this year, I asked many many muscular men about what gives them motivation. The answers varied from ""I love doing it"" to ""I have  discipline"", but there was only one answer that wasn't there, and it's the one I needed to hear the most. ""It's not for everyone. It's not really a matter of choice. I'm just lucky to like it and to manage to do it consistently. What gives me motivation? I don't know, what gives a painter motivation to paint? I like it because I like it, it's not something I can control, and your hating it is not something you can control either. We shouldn't judge fat people and you're fine as you are"". 

Honestly, I think I'm not really interested in hearing their motivation secrets, but, moreso, in examining how arrogant they are. I'm trying to understand the extent to which they're aware of they're environment and the world around them. Do they really think fat people are just lazy?  Do they really unfortunate people deserve their fate? Can they give comfort or consolation to people who fell between the cracks?"
18yhfyx,Depression,2024-01-04,How can I overcome depression?,"I’ve been depressed for going on 2 years now. It comes and goes, I’ll start to feel strong again but the emptiness begins to fall back in place. I’ll just be hit with a wave and fall right back down again. I feel hopeless and wonder, What am I doing wrong? I always try my best to move forward and better myself, but that’s easier said than done. I’ll apply at several jobs but a majority of them never get back to me. I don’t have my license yet so I can’t drive myself places. I hate having to rely on others, it makes me feel so incompetent. I feel like I’ve been stuck inside my house and mind for a majority of these past couple years. Everyday is the same, I wake up and do little tasks to pass the time until I can sleep again. I feel like I’m not progressing in life at all, while everyone else around me is doing well for themselves. I don’t have many friends anymore since I graduated high school. I feel like I’m hard to like/love, and when people show it to me I get the urge to push them away as I don’t feel deserving of it. I constantly feel judged by the people around me, even though they probably don’t care. But what would you do in this situation? What steps can I take to properly better myself and my life in general? How can I overcome this feeling that’s been holding me down for so long? What other advice would you give to me or someone else who may be in the same position? Thank you."
18yhdzz,Depression,2024-01-04,So lost,"I am at a loss for what to do anymore. 

I've been depressed all my life. 37 years. It's hitting a new low. I've been on Zoloft for years which historically kept me functioning, Wellbutrin for about a year which has been helped a lot with my energy levels. In September I had a horrible experience with my therapist. I called her out on something unethical she was doing and she spent our last session gaslighting and berating me. I have never felt so betrayed in my life - and that's saying a heck of a lot as someone with CPTSD. Since then I have not been right and it's only going downhill fast. 

I take Vitamin D and B complex and I'm otherwise generally healthy. I had the Wellbutrin increased but it doesn't seem to be helping much. My insomnia is terrible, and Trazadone works for that but it makes me groggy in the morning so I can't really take it during the work week. My cat, who was my best friend for 17 years, died last week. My new therapist is nice but I just can't get comfortable with her and I feel so numb and closed off. We started EMDR and it just makes me so so tired. 

I think my biggest fear is that my depression is worsening due to situational/environmental factors that are out of my control. I've tried to change what I can, but it's wearing me down rapidly and I don't know what to do. If I reach out to my psych nurse she's just going to tinker with my meds and I'll be left to deal with whatever the side effects are. It's really hard to be open and candid with my new therapist, probably due to the trauma of what happened with the last one. I don't have parents or family who can help me in any meaningful way. There's no childhood home to go back to for respite - everything has been lost over and over again. I don't feel seen or understood by anyone. It feels like there are foundational emotional needs that have never been met and now they're screaming for attention 24/7 and I can't even articulate what it feels like or what I need. It's like a painful hollowness. My entire being aches and I'm just so done. I'm messing up at work a lot and I can't focus. I feel literally like I've become dumb, like I'm just not sharp at all anymore and can't remember things that happened an hour ago. 

I'm really just venting. Crying into the void! If you read this whole thing, I'm sorry but also thank you. I am at my lowest and I am clueless as to what to do other than take time off work and just sleep so I won't have to feel.

18yh2mp,Depression,2024-01-04,(19F) Not making it past 26.,"I just kind of made it my rule, by age 16-17. I told myself that I would off myself somewhere in my 20’s, maybe by 26 or 28. It gives me some relief, knowing that I won’t be here for way too long. I could never see myself living past 30, at most.  I’m not sure if I’ll have kids or not, but if I do, I might hold off.

I never thought that I’d be someone to want to go through with something like that, but life feels so dull and I’ve never felt as empty as I do now. My anxiety has gotten so much worse, I shake and avoid eyes whenever I go out and see decent amounts of people. My moods fluctuate way too often, one minute I’m doing okay, and the next I’m being bitter to family and friends. I have such an extremely low social battery, I start getting (semi) snappy within three hours. I barely have friends, I lack the social skills and confidence to make more. I don’t hang out with anyone in real life, there’s no one to hang out with. 

In groups, I’m always the one that’s kinda left out, it’s been like that since forever. I overthink way too much, if I do manage to make some new friends, I always think that they secretly hate me or that I’m a inconvenience to them regardless as to if they say or show me otherwise— genuinely. 

Also, with friends, there’s always a new person that comes in and becomes the bestest of friends with my friend, and then things dry up between us and we end up falling completely out of touch. It’s happened so many times, I’m starting to think that I’m the problem. Is it because I tend to over-adore the people that I become friends with? I always wanna be so close, but it seems like no one ever wants to reciprocate.

I could go on and on about all these problems and worries and shit that I have. To sum it all up, I’m tired."

18ygu5k,Depression,2024-01-04,My fault?,"I keep getting told that I just don’t have enough of a positive attitude. That I look at things negatively. They don’t say this out loud, but they blame me for my depression, anxiety, suicidal ideation and sh. I’m just “not positive enough”. 

They think I don’t try hard enough. I see my doctor regularly, I try really hard to take my meds everyday, I’ve tried so many therapies.

Is all this suffering really my fault? Have I done this to myself? If I die will people just think “she was just such a negative person and didn’t want to help herself”. Will they say I deserved it?

And the worst thing is that I’ve been through nothing. No trauma, no hardship. I have a wonderful family and group of friends. 

I’m just so tired. I’m setting a date now. If things aren’t better by New Year’s Eve that has to be my end. That gives me a year of more trying.

Is it bad that I’m tired of trying? I’ve been trying since I was a preteen. I went through years of constant panic attacks until my body just gave up. 

Anyways, that was a lot of rambling but it’s time to hold myself to a date. No rash decisions. I’ll give myself a year."

But during my days off, it's harder. I see ""what could've been"" seeing happy couples, large groups of friends, or parents with their beautiful children. I also see the judgmental looks of people, women grimacing in disgust or prejudice when seeing me, and men looking at me in sympathy or pity. It reminds me of how much I hate myself and I come back home totally defeated. I wish I was born a woman, perhaps I'd experience some form of kindness or companionship, or perhaps if I was better looking or taller, I wouldn't be in this position. I'm probably just projecting and seeing things that aren't really there but I just had to get this off my chest since I am so very lonely.

18yey83,Depression,2024-01-04,i’m truly just super exhausted,"TW: cocsa, sexual grooming, other types of abuse, neglect (in case i’ve missed any tw pls let me know)

i (24f) feel so lost and confused lately. i have so much anger inside me at all times, and i try, i try to be happier, to be more positive, to be more objective and try to work on myself outside of all of this. but it isn’t working. it just isn’t happening. and there’s multiple reasons i can think of as to why. 
1. i feel like im running out of time because of how much pressure i feel from my parents and family to do better.
2. i feel like im trying to heal overnight even though i very clearly know that isn’t possible, but this is because im trying to catch up to my abuser (my big brother).
as pathetic as it sounds, i can’t watch my brother be more successful and do better than me. it makes me mad, frustrated and sad. it pains me to know that someone who abused me sexually, verbally, physically and emotionally for years on end could be doing much better than i am. 
at work today, my supervisor came to talk to me since i gave in my notice, and he told me “i know you’re shy and it takes time for you to establish connections and talk to others, but you should change that about yourself”. that’s my entire fkin personality tho? also why tf am i supposed to do that?? it angers me. i’m so fucking angry. this is what i want to say to him- do you have any fucking idea what a person has to go through to be so scared of others? to be so fucking terrified of authority because someone in authority sexually groomed me for 5 years? or how stupid it fucking feels that i can’t make small talk because im just so terrified of people? 
all i’ve learnt is that i can’t fit into society. i can’t be normal. and i know that’s a futile ideal to want to fulfill but everyone around me, ever since i can remember, has always acted like im so weird and abnormal that all i really want is a place to belong.
i gave in my notice not only because this is not a job im interested in but also because when you go to work, you make friends with the people you work with, there are professional boundaries you’re supposed to set and follow but i can’t do any of it. i can’t make friends, im always in my own corner unable to talk to anyone. cause any time i make conversation i feel like a fucking weirdo. 
also i just feel pathetic cause every time something goes bad in my life lately, i get angry because it’s because of behaviors brought about by trauma, and the people who traumatized me are doing much better than me (ik, the grass is always greener on the other side), and lastly im just so angry with my parents. they not only let the abuse go on, they didn’t know about the sexual abuse but my brother used to curse at me, yell at me and hit me/throw things at me in front of them. and yet i’ve never seen them scold him. any time i brought it up, all they said was “we scolded him when you weren’t there” and i don’t trust that for a second. what kind of parents let a home tutor spend the entire night at their house cause the guy’s apparently tutoring their daughter the entire night? not letting her sleep? prioritizing my fucking grades over my health? good fucking job parents. yknow what happened in those tutoring sessions? i tutored the guy in sex instead cause he would constantly ask intrusive questions. i shut myself off from everyone else cause he wouldn’t let me talk to anyone. and when i did tell my family about this, they ignored me, hired the dude for my little cousin brother anyway. the amount of fucking times i’ve had to be around him unnecessarily. 
there’s a lot more i want to say but im all exhausted for now. i just don’t know how to function as a person anymore. i dont know how to be a part of society and make friends and have relationships. the only relationship that goes somewhat successfully for me is me and my cat. i’m tired."

I suffer from anxiety depression and cptsd my life isn't getting better I'm not very smart I'm not very pretty and lately I've been thinking about hurting people or animals I had a girlfriend for 4 years at first everything was fine then a year into the relationship she started abusing me I don't have the strength to talk about it but She beat, ignored, screamed and almost killed me one day I broke up with her because she would barely talk to her and I was one year above her and I was the only one who was nice to her and I was also her only boyfriend and friend then on an annual trip she met some girls and then at the end of the year at a graduation party she invited them that she Knew for a few months and didn't talk to them for all that time from a friend of hers who was with her for 2.5 years and helped her stop cutting herself helped her with depression and ocd while I get depressed because of her starts cutting Because of her a few months before we broke up I started seeing gore and I went deep I saw snuff r73 mdpope and some other mixtapes and then I started cutting more I tried to kill myself but I was scared but I started cutting deeper at the same time I started pills from a doctor and I'm not going to talk much about it but I had a difficult childhood my mother She was drunk and beat me and wouldn't buy food and would disappear. Now I remember that I also have abandonment anxiety and psychosis. In short, I started pills and broke up with her, I couldn't sleep, so I got sleeping pills the first month after I broke up with her, she had a hard time crying and said she was going to kill herself and it was a whole story and I stayed and helped her but I said I wanted to cut ties and about three months ago I talked to her and by the way because of the situation we both have We worked. I still don't work, but at the same time we started talking again, she started working and she really changed She stopped being violent, stopped yelling and became a more normal person and then we got back in touch and once in the previous relationship if I didn't chase her and call every day and send messages she wouldn't send or talk to me at all there was a case where I wanted to check how long it would take for her to send me a message and it took her two weeks and it's not that we didn't talk a lot because of all my work we talked every day usually so we got back in touch and I was really afraid that I would be alone regardless of the fact that she is a very beautiful girl I have low self-confidence because I was constantly beaten and laughed at at school because of that too I never had any friends of my own but she and all my family and other people told me that I was beautiful and smart and that I didn't have to worry even though my friend would always curse and yell at me she never disrespected my looks or my wisdom so because once I told her this time You are responsible for our relationship as friends, you send messages, you call, and she really did that, sent messages every day, talked to me every day, so because of my anxiety that I won't find a partner, which by the way is because I want a life partner, someone I can marry, live, grow old, and die with, and live A quiet life not for sex and parties and things like that. But because of this anxiety that I won't find anyone but her I went back to her and at first everything was fine but in the last three weeks she has returned to the time she doesn't hit but once again shouts ignores and behaves aggressively and also about a week and a half ago I went back to gore I went deeper than last time last time I had Voices and pictures and loss of reality and a few weeks ago I started a pill that really helped it was the first pill that helped me but with everything that has been happening to me recently it has already stopped helping and the sleeping pill doesn't help I want to break up with her but I'm afraid I won't find anyone and I'm afraid because from everything I saw I started having murderous intentions to live and people I've never physically hurt anyone but myself I can't anymore my father said I'll find someone but I'm afraid I don't have any friends And she's the only one I've had but even if I want it or not the relationship won't work I'm just suffering because of her I went back to cutting I read that my pills can be dangerous at high levels for me? for me to kill myself? I can't take it anymore I just want someone to be with and if I'm not okay with being alone but I can't do it I don't know what to do everyone told me I'm a good partner and I know I am I'm patient I always make time I help I know I can succeed In relationships, I only have a problem of anxiety that they will betray me, but I worked on it and almost solved it, but I can't anymore, I just don't"

Unfortunately today I was informed that I haven’t been working fast and that my job is on the line. I know I can make efforts to get my assignments done faster although I do my best to work as fast as possible. 
The part that depresses me is that I’ve been working this job since I was 18 and it is a heavy part of where I earn money basically my livelihood and this comes right when I have finally worked up the courage to get my own place. 
I’m really scared to loose my job and the fear has caused me to break down because aside of being here for so long and actually liking my job it’s the only thing in I felt that I could do right. The only thing that really gives me purpose, something that I can say I actually can do. I struggled so badly to get a job when I was younger and I’m just heartbroken. I just had to get that off my chest because I don’t feel comfortable sharing my feeling or crying in front of others so I came here where no one can hear my cries or see my tears. I hope and pray everything gets better and I’m trying to stay positive. It’s the beginning of a new year. I should be happy but I’m not gonna lie this killed my mood. I’m sorry for rambling. You all have a great day."

18zxuud,Depression,2024-01-06,Advice on how to get through this time,"I feel broken down by this lifetime, but these past few months especially. Dealing with a family crisis where my immigrant parents have lost their jobs, we are dealing with a lawsuit of 60k that will probably lose but we don’t have that money, and my dad has Parkinson’s. I’m a student, and I really can’t help financially, I feel so useless. 

I have dealt with a lot of mental health problems before. Currently medicated and sober.. lost a lot of weight this year and I look quite pale and weak. I hate myself so much. I feel like an empty shell. I feel so ugly, so unlovable. My boyfriend is worried about me, but he can’t help me. I feel like I’m alone in this world. I feel like I can’t save myself.  

I feel so hindered from my studies, I’m so distracted by what is going on. I’m scared for my security, where my parents will sleep, if they will get all their things taken from them, I don’t know. 

Can someone please help me with a morning routine or with advice that helped them with depression and stress? Going to the clinic in 10 days… maybe my medication is not working for me anymore. 

Thank you so much for reading"

18yc4rf,Depression,2024-01-04,"70 year old uncle, died of depression","Hi all,

I'm not sure what I'm looking for or if this is the right place, but my uncle just passed away and though he died from a stroke or something similarly quick, what got him in his fragile state was depression. He stopped eating for 10 days before we called the police for a welfare check- he lived out of state.

 He was in decline since the passing of his mother 5 years ago who he lived with for her last 40+ years. He was getting his phd in the late 80s and then moved home after something happened half way through. Never told anyone. 1.5 years ago he stopped answering phone calls from his family and we had a member go check on him. He was skin and bones and was in the hospital and physical therapy for a month or so. My dad helped him set up a long term plan for his health, his insurance, and nutrition. He was better, for a while. 

When we got him into the hospital on Dec 26 he was reportedly in good spirits, eating, and walking the halls-assisted- a lot. Two days later while sitting in a chair at the hospital the nurse went to get him iced tea. Came back and he had passed away. It seems the damage done to his body the first time around and then the relapse was too much for his body. 

I'm struggling with my selfish grief of knowing we didn't do enough, that depression killed him, and that he was so actively trying yo get better. It feels like an elongated death by suicide but after the person stepped back off the ledge. 

This has hurt more than the passing of all my grandparents because of that. There is no peace. There is no peace that comes from a death from depression. I hope all of you struggling- like I myself struggle as a fellow diagnosed- know that even if you feel alone you aren't. Even if you feel like everyone else has their direct family unit and you are not thought of and loved, that you are so loved. And while I know the seeming impossibility of reaching out to someone to say 'hey I'm not okay right now. Can you help me?' Can be a literal lifesaver. And my biggest shame is knowing that a couple calls of my own asking 'hey are you okay' could have been the raft as well. 

I miss him so much, and I don't know if he felt loved when he passed, but I love him so much too. 

I love you uncle Steve."
18ybp63,Depression,2024-01-04,My birthday was horrible (looking for feedback),"Now I’m here looking for some kind of guidance of whether or not I’m the one at fault here. 

I 22F celebrated my birthday today - lying in bed in my feels now - and kept insisting I wanted a relaxing day. 
Plan was to wake up and go to gym then have a family brunch at home. My sister being the legend she is organised this all for me including the cake. 

In the morning we decided we would do something in the evening after work. I was feeling really down since I felt like the day was so generic. Nothing overly out of the blue happened. I even ended up napping between brunch and work. So I did everything I could to get myself hyped up. 

My family decided on one restaurant to order from and I wasn’t set on it but eventually decided I would just get food from there but would message them if I ended up picking something else up on my way home. Which I told them and they agreed 

Work ended early so I went for a walk etc and got home earlier than planned. Get home on a high note since I managed to pull myself out of feeling down only to find my family (excluding my sister) already eating the food the ordered and drinking. 

No apology was made and they acted shocked. I was very visibly upset and quietly just said I would go get my own food. 

No offer of coming with me or anything so I left and did some grocery shopping and got food. 
I cried in the car and I felt so dramatic because it’s just food why am I making such a big deal about this. 

I made it SO clear I was upset the rest of the evening and I feel bad about that. When they went to bed it just felt so weird. No happy birthday last minute like we usually do or any apology. I even made a comment to my mother about it TWICE and she just ignored it. 

I’m still feeling really upset about it but also feel like I was ungrateful for the day by having this attitude. 

Am I the problem here?"

So I have been thinking about death. Take my life away. Every day, without rest, I always thought about how I'm going to die. But all the methods seem to be enormously painful. 

I have two choices. Die or live. Normally, anybody would choose to live, but for me, it's Gordian knot. If I have to choose to live, than it will be like trying to fly without wings. That's how I feel. 

I sincerely hope that I've been thinking too hard. All those pains, memories, experiences Made me who I am. It's like curse. Please God, help me."
18ybkf4,Depression,2024-01-04,I hate being on my own,"Backstory. I've never lived alone. I am 24f and never lived alone. I've lived with different parents, house mates and my bow ex husband never completely on my own. I have a bf now and it's pretty serious but we don't live together so for a fair amount of time each week I'm on my own. It's been a few months I've lived on my own but I hate it.
There's probably multiple factor that go into this with big life changes and all but I get depressed on my own. I feel very low and I've started looking at my old selfharm photos and stuff. I've been thinking about it but only when on my own. I'm not going to selfharm and I don't want to but I've been thinking about it. Have done it since 17. 
It's like even at work and stuff I'm ok and anytime I from outside back to my house or he leave me alone at my place the darkness creeps back in. I feel low and sad and I don't like it. I don't want to feel that way and I'm not entirely sure why it's gotten intense so suddenly. I'm happier than I've ever been in my relationship and I have friends when it comes to work now but when I go home I'm alone and I feel extremely alone and I don't want to tell my bf becuase if I do he'll worry and he will be sad and I don't want to basically make him think he has to be around all the time and stuff like that. I don't want to basically manipulate him. 
Oh and I'd I mention I also have fibromyalgia with a major component of fatigue so when I feel low I'm alone in pain which feed each other. It may be a factor that he pretty much takes away most of the pain just by being around me and when I'm with the people I like from work they distract from any pain I have really well which probably doesn't help with contrast between out and home. 
I hate living alone. 

Also not really looking for advice just venting."

I have been back and forth living with my grandma and my parents for a few months.  I just spent a fairly long visit with my parents for the last maybe 2 weeks.  Today I was going back to my Grandma's but when I knocked she didn't answer,  that is unusual for her. SoI unlocked the door to go in and she was sitting in her recliner hunched over and still. She was stiff and blue.  She had clearly been dead for at least a few hours. My mom called 911 while I had a breakdown outside.  It took 5 hours to get things delt with enough that we could go home.  

My grandma was the only person I had for a long time. My family hated me and I hated them in turn. It was only recently and with the help of my grandma and mental health professionals that I was able to rebuild a relationship with the rest of my family. I told her everything. Things I've never told anyone else. She helped me deal with those things.  She wasn't even that old. She was about to turn 64. I lost my papa just over 2 years ago.  I am at the lowest point I've ever been.  I am ready to just die. I don't see the point in going on anymore.  We all die.

191acjh,Depression,2024-01-08,Dealing with loss,"Hello everyone,

I never expected to use this account for anything other than software development, but I have been struggling a lot lately and I needed some sort of outlet.

I have been in a relationship with my first girlfriend for the past 2.5 years. She was my first everything, and I love her more deeply than anything else in the world. I fell so deeply for her, that I (regrettably) neglected most of my other friendships and even some family relationships. Of note, she also has a small child whom I have come to love as well and have connected with over the years. My girlfriend and I were so close that we would spend the majority of every day together and would frequently text each other throughout the day.

We’ve had our ups and downs just like any other relationship but we’ve always loved each other and respected each other. We’ve helped each other through very hard times and have explored new territories with each other. I feel a deep love for her even now just writing about it.

Unfortunately, my girlfriend has been away from her childhood friends and family during this entire time because she was in the military (and ended up across the country where I live). Recently, she has been really struggling with this emotionally, and has decided to move back to her hometown. I recently graduated from college and found a new (promising) job in the area that we’ve been living.

All this to say, I now feel stuck. If I move and follow her, I’d be giving up a pretty good career opportunity (but may be able to find another one near her), but I would be happy with her. She says she still loves me and says that her door is always open to me, but we have essentially broken things off unless I follow her. Now, without her, I feel I have no actual connections/relationships and have fallen into deep sadness out of loneliness. She still messages me infrequently throughout the day, but I find myself having to forcefully not text her because I don’t want to bother her. I constantly look forward to another one of her messages and I am starting to think it isn’t healthy, but I don’t want to let her go.

I’m having a hard time thinking about anything other than her and the great moments we’ve had together and it makes me very sad knowing that we may never have that again. I have found myself losing motivation to do anything. I feel lost, sometimes dazed from sadness, and don’t see any solution

TLDR: I’ve lost my first ever girlfriend as she has moved away for her own mental health, and now I feel lost"

I was just discharged from that psych ward in the ER yesterday. I'm back on my meds (Trintellix and Auvelity). Things are seeming to look up for me. I appreciate the pretty snow...the trees...my best friends who really, really love me...my father who ran to me and gave me the tightest hug when I got out of the hospital....

(I’m not taking it for depression I’m on it for OCD) It’s never helped my depression anyway, which has led my Dr to believe I might have low dopamine, (well that and how severe my symptoms are) I can barely function at this point, literally everything feels like a chore, even just getting out of bed, and I no longer experience a simple bad day, bc what used to be bad days are now breakdown days, where I completely lose it bc something seemingly small sends me over the edge, this is why it’s so discouraging that there aren’t many (If any at all) medication options for me, im in therapy and I do all of the things, it helps like I genuinely don’t think I’d be here without my therapist, but there is definitely something deeper going on and it wasn’t an easy decision to go the medication route, but I’m tired of living this way.

Last term, simply being at school made me so agitated that i try to hurt myself nearly everyday that i am in school. The counsellor nearly sent me back home on some occasions because of how bad it was (unfortunately i had responsibilities to attend to after school on many days, so i was forced to stay)

Now that the new term is nearing, i am basically losing my shit over imagining how my days at school will be like. I cannot endure that torture again. It’s too much for me to handle. I do not want to spend entire days at school panicking and feeling depressed all the time. It doesn’t even stop when I’m at home, because all I could worry about is the fact that I have to attend school the next day.

Just thinking about having to go to school soon is making me panic. I just don’t want to go because I know I can’t handle it.

191bj37,Depression,2024-01-08,Processing guilt &amp; shame from a manic episode,"I went through an intense manic episode with psychosis that lasted 11 months a year ago. I falsely accused my former employer of showing videos of me getting raped as a little child and other gross things that happened to me when I was small.  
I'd harass them by sending over 15+ emails a day to my old colleagues, HR, my ex, and old friends detailing the ""abuse"". I took to Twitter, and Facebook too so every one of my friends had seen my delusions and saw me go through this episode.  
I never told anyone I was raped from the age of 5 through 11. Not my ex of 8 years, not my therapist of three years(both of which I'd loop into the insane emails I'd send out)  
I deal with intense feelings of guilt and shame daily. I get flashbacks and the episode keeps replaying in my head over and over again and I can't get it to stop. Just when I think I'm healing I get sucked back into the loop  
Lately, I've been having a lot of suicidal ideation. I'm afraid the only way to get these feelings to stop is if I kill myself. Tbh, the only thing that’s stopped me from it is my mom, I imagine how she'd feel and it kills me inside. She is also bipolar and I know she'll probably commit suicide too  
I guess my question is, does it ever get better? Do the intrusive thoughts and the nonstop flashbacks ever stop? Will I ever have a semblance of a normal life?"
1919eqc,Depression,2024-01-08,It's never been this bad,"I've never posted to a place like this before and I don't know if I'm making a mistake doing this. I (M27) I've had a pretty rough couple of weeks but these past few days have been really bad. I'm taking bupropion 450 mg and a couple weeks ago was one of the first days the depression was overshadowing. It feels like a sinking pit in my stomach starting from my throat I can't think and I don't know how to open up to the people around me asking me what's wrong. I just brush it off and say that I'm tired. Work has been okay, my personal life isn't the greatest but I'm doing the best that I can to make the most of it. I openly admitted to my doctor a couple days ago that I feel like I want to die but I don't feel like doing it myself. I sometimes just don't want to be here anymore. I would never want to put my family and friends through that but at the same time if something were to happen to me whether it be sickness or an accident or whatever, I honestly would welcome it. My doctor did add another medication that I can't recall the name of to go with my bupropion and it's supposed to help raise my serotonin levels. The only thing is it's not going to really make an effect until a month or so into taking it he said. I don't know if I can keep doing this shit anymore. I've been this way my entire life and this is the first time since I was a teenager that I felt this bad. I don't know what to do anymore. I'm going to be starting therapy in the next couple of weeks as well and I'm hoping that it helps. I don't know if this will get lost or if I'm just talking to the void but I just thought I would share."

What can I expect starting this low"
1912hbx,Depression,2024-01-07,"I need to change - lonliness, tears, selfishness, fear of commitment, trust issues","I don't know how I (29 M) ended up here, but I feel like I just need to vent somewhere. My morning started like any other, but suddenly I became extremely dejected and desperate, really desperate. The last time I cried was 2 years ago, when my 7-year relationship ended due to cheating and lies, and today it happened again. Since the breakup and life changes, I have been moving through life, in my opinion, relatively balanced. But after several attempts to find a new partner, each time I was the one who pushed the other person away when it got serious, I've come to realize that I must admit to having developed a serious attachment disorder. At the same time, I feel miserable about how I deal with other people and their feelings, at some point I turned into a total asshole, I have knowingly hurt other people because I act so selfish.  
  
I' also have a romantic relationship for the past six months (nothing really physical has happened yet, except that we cuddled together well into the night a few times) with a work friend who I also meet privately (different employer, I get around a lot in my job), who is, however, in a long-term relationship. I believe that it became clear to me that this can't go on forever and must not continue, for both of our sakes. This realization came in the same moment I understood I have an attachment disorder. I think this realization was the last straw that broke the camel's back and robbed me of hope that I had previously harbored for this romance. And here too, I am acting extremely selfishly and like a total jerk. She's doing exactly the same thing as my ex did back then, and yet, I have feelings for her; I'm aware that there's another man sitting at home going through the same thing I went through 2 years ago. Even if it's mainly emotional cheating so far, it's still cheating. But honestly? I don't care, I just don't care, and I don't understand when I acquired this selfishness and lack of empathy.  
  
Now everything has suddenly crashed down on me, the problems at work, the problems in my private life, my health issues, my dog's health issues, the attachment disorder, the hopelessness in the ongoing romance, the realization that I´m an selfish asshole and the realization that I'm turning 30 next year and don't have any of what I wanted by then. I never necessarily wanted children, but I'm not made to be alone. I seek the closeness of others, but at the same time push them away as soon as they get too close. I think this behavior and my extreme pessimism arose from many different situations in which I was lied to and cheated on over a long period, my hope being destroyed over and over again. By now, I always only see the worst outcome and the bad in people.  
  
My circle of friends is small and hard to reach. I can't really talk openly with anyone and find it difficult to articulate my feelings. The relationship with my family has always been difficult, and I don't find a safe haven to return to there. At work, I have responsibility for an entire company, employee responsibility, and I'm involved in sales; I have to be reliable for others, show strength, and appear happy to my customers.  
  
I've been telling myself to be happy all this time, as I have always only pretended to be in front of others, but today was the day when I could no longer lie to myself.  
  
I am aware that there are definitely far worse fates than mine, but I currently just feel empty and have no more drive. Do you have any suggestions for me on how I can help myself? Psychological counseling is almost impossible due to the high demand in the region. Otherwise, perhaps just encouragement, or stories of similar fates that ended more positively would also help."
18zxkzx,Depression,2024-01-06,Honestly I just want to die,"I know it's my fault I feel this way and I don't know if I'll ever really be able to or even want to change how I feel. I feel like I should never get to be happy because I feel like I don't deserve it. It doesn't matter how much money I make or how much I try and distract myself, I always feel that empty feeling inside. 

People tell me that I need to love myself, but I don't see the point."
18y9bod,Depression,2024-01-04,Not everybody thinks about dying,"I had a conversation with one of my friends and they said they had never ever thought about dying before at least beyond a metaphysical sense. It hit me like a bus because all this while I was under the assumption that everybody thought about death at some point in a kms way and not just a philosophical one. 
Turns out only 5% of people in the world are depressed and I suddenly feel super alone."
18y9apn,Depression,2024-01-04,i have no idea why i feel like this,"I dont really know what going on but ive felt this way for years now. When this first started i thought it was just hormonal teenage type shi, but now that im 20 years old and still feel the same way, i'm wanting help. Before i start yapping, i do suffer from quite bad anxiety, as my entire family does. However, i dont think its the full cause as to how i feel. Another thing that i've thought could be a cause is my dad. He's an alcoholic, a biggggg narcissist, and has a few traces of what we think is maybe bipolar or even some form of personality disorder (not that we tell him this is what we think). I get really sad, almost everyday. Some days it could be from the minute i wake up. Other days, ill have the motivation to go out, be happy, and enjoy a little bit of my day for a little while, but ill always at some point just crash and get extremely sad about nothing. Sometimes this switch of emotion can be in seconds. And sometimes it stems from a thought that either stresses me out, or a thought of something specific, but sometimes it just happens randomly. But from there, my mind just feeds itself shit to feel sad about. its so hard for me to explain cus this shi confuses me a lot.. im not sad about something in particular, instead ill just feel really really depressed. Like the things i usually like doing, like gaming, wont be any fun, i'll start to stress out about stuff, and ill have no motivation for anything. Sometimes ill think about life itself, and just reflect on how boring and lonely my life is, which obviously just makes things worse, but i cant help it. Other times, ill get small spikes of motivation and joy, kinda like a ""nah f\*ck this, imma change my life around, force myself to be happy"" type shi. But 5 mins later ill be back to the sad state.   


I'm too scared to seek help because last time i did, the lady i had an appointment with just gave me a piece of paper with silly questions on it, which ended up giving me a free counselling session at some teen counselling place. I feel like i really didnt get the treatment i needed, and probably because i answered  ""no"" to the 'have you thought of ki\*\*ing yourself' question on the stupid little piece of paper. I guess you could say i feel as if i wont be taking seriously if i were to seek professional help again."
18xov05,Depression,2024-01-03,I’m too exhausted to do what I used to enjoy after work,"i was neet for about 3 years until i got a full time job. i had all day to do basically whatever i wanted, to do what i enjoyed.

i used to play a lot of video games, paint and read but now i do none of it. literally 0. i know they’re just hobbies and a waste of time, but it gave me something to look forward to and a distraction.  

now i have a 9-5. i have plenty of time to do things when i get back from work, i just don’t have the mental or physical energy to do it even though it isn’t a mentally or physically demanding job. all i have the energy to do when i get home is smoke weed and fall asleep. it’s making me depressed. i’ve only been working full time since august and i already want to quit. 

i’ve tried a lot of different things to help me. i tried mindfulness, meditation, exercise, going outside, putting my phone away after work, more caffeine to wake me up, and i quit weed for a while. literally nothing has helped. 

i feel like i’m in this dead end cycle of being miserable 24/7. i waste my limited hours working for barely any money because i’m on an apprentice wage (even though it hasn’t started yet, so technically i’m just a normal employee right now) just to come home exhausted and drained and not able to do anything. just work and sleep. it feels like a literal unending hell. 

i’m scared it’s going to be this way until i retire or die. i also don’t have to option of quitting because i need money and all the paperwork for my apprenticeship is already done and i’ve gone through a lot of trouble to get where i am. 

does anyone else feel the same? if so, how do/did you cope?"
18y8hrk,Depression,2024-01-04,I'm already tired at this age.,"I'm a 14y/o girl who has been going through tics, depression, hallucinations, mental breakdowns, palilalia, panic and anxiety attacks, and straight-up anxiety since I was nearly 13. I've lost motivation for school and my own family because everything just ends up as toxic. I struggled with my goal in life and started to slowly self-harm with scissors now and then, my parents didn't understand what I was going through and said it's only because I've diagnosed myself after learning about these. And even if I explain my situation to anyone, they say I'm just faking. After getting traumatized by my mother I got scared of her, my father, and even my sisters from touching me.  I've been SH-ed 2 times and I've told no one about this, not even my closest friend. At this point, I feel broken and empty, getting toxic replies back while being mocked or taunted just hurts me completely. I need help but I can't, I want to leave everyone when I turn 18 and never see them again. 

Can someone just please explain how to stay alive and happy?"
18y8e06,Depression,2024-01-04,Planning to commit suicide in the next week or so,Yeah I'm just planning to commit suicide by overdose because there is basically no point of life just reproduce die forget repeat until we all die and I just FUCKING HATE MY BODY
18y84lh,Depression,2024-01-04,Told my cousin I almost attempted suicide. She told my dad.,"Every year at Christmas we stay at my Nan's for a few days. I don't have a good relationship with her. It's mainly because I'm autistic and she's really fucking loud and changes plans at the drop of a hat, despite me telling her for years that I can't deal with it. There's  other specific things I have an issue with, like how she called my sister fat and will comment on what me and my sister eat. Essentially, I show up, have a panic attack pretty much as soon as I walk in the door. I try hide as much as I can, but the house echoes and it's never quiet. I'm talking, can hear every word people are saying with headphones in, at the other end of the house when you're on different floors. When I asked people to be quieter, I got yelled at. At one point my nan was winding me up, I asked her three times politely to stop, then got yelled at when I snapped after she wouldn't stop, or have a conversation with me about it. I realise this sounds really fucking stupid. It wasn't even a desire to die, it was just a need to get away. My thinking was that if I'm dead it'll be quiet, and if I'm injured I can go to hospital to get away from that fucking woman.
I was talking to my cousin about why I don't get on with my nan, and I mentioned what had happened. She told my dad, who rambled at me for an hour in the middle of the night. I've had maybe 3 hours sleep. Fuming."

Afterwards, I either feel drained, kind of angry, relieved or a mix of things? I don't know 🥴

Sometimes I remember the dream and sometimes I don't remember it."
18y7w4a,Depression,2024-01-04,Depression and alcoholism,"Over the past few years my depression has led to ever worsening alcoholism. It's gotten to the point where my family is worried and I feel myself wasting away. If I don't drink the depression comes back. My father is annoyed, I'm very behind in school. My mother worries about my health. I hate the fact that everyone worries about me but nobody cares about me. It's as if they want me miserable but not dead. I'm posting here because I've hit my limit. Everyone I know IRL that has depression doesn't seem to be nearly as effected by it as I am. I don't like being an alcoholic but it's the only way to quell the insecurities. Does anyone else have experience with this?


I'm an 18m. I've had signs of alcoholism since I was 16. It's gotten worse in recent years though. Ever since I hit the legal age for purchasing alcohol I haven't been able to help myself. Not only do I wish I was dead, I believe I ought to be dead. I'm nothing, I've done nothing and I'll never do anything. My family is rich, I have a good life, but no matter what I seem to fuck it up.

It became worst in 2021. Because I think that my crush is dead. I did ended in 2019 and i didn’t know it till then. I’ve been thinking about killing myself but I’m a pussy to do it. I feel like killing myself but I don’t want to. Ik this sounds like I’m a crazy person but I think having a crush on some cartoon character is normal. I get that she’s not real, I get that.

I haven't accomplished anything of any significance in my 28 years of living. I know I should have a career by now but I have no idea what to do with my life or where to even start. I've had no guidance my entire life as I was raised by a horrible mother, no father. My grandparents did the best they could but they could only do so much. I just want s stable income and some friends but it seems almost impossible the older I get.

I'm sorry i know i shouldn't be saying this but I hate my profession and this profession has brought me nothing but misery. Because of my severe anxiety and depression I'm unable to perform well but I'm stuck here since 10 years. My country has a high rate of doctor suicides. And I'm scared of my life. Even knowing that leaving this profession would help me a lot in regaining my mental health but Im absolutely paralysed and delsuional regarding making this decision. I should've left a long time ago but I didn't. i don't know why I can't leave. Why I can't do this, why I don't have courage to quit. It's like my heart wants to quit but my brain doesn't. I'm so delsuional and stupid. I have been wanting to kill myself ever since I entered med school 10 years ago. Therapy and antidepressants works only a little because I know the real reason for my issues is my hatred towards my profession. But I can't leave please help me. 
Why I'm not able to quit?

Edit: I want to leave my toxic family and for that I have to earn a lot of money to move out of the house. This contradiction that I want to leave my house and I need a lot of money for that is not letting me leave my profession. I feel like a child dependant on my family. Even if I leave my house I'm scared if I will kill myself."
18zwtfg,Depression,2024-01-06,i need someone to talk to,i’m spiraling down fast and i’m scared
18y7qko,Depression,2024-01-04,I don’t understand why I always end up back where I started.,"I’m turning 18 soon. I’m an autistic and severely depressed person. I have had therapy, medication, and support systems of all types for almost 5 years now. Sometimes I feel better but whenever I hit a pebble in the road it feels like a boulder. These pebbles in. the road are becoming more frequent. I’m scared to become an adult when I can barely understand how to keep myself stable. I tend to overreact to a lot of these situations but can’t understand how to handle it better. 

Recently, I had a breakdown because I fought with my partner. They are currently across the world from me on a trip for the holidays. I begged them to immediately come by my place when they arrive back in town, but they told me they wanted to spend time alone and some with their mother first. I completely blew up on them, spiraling from “Why not see me first?” to “I’m not loved.” 

I understand their relationship with their mother, as they are very close. But on the other hand, I have been struggling for a while with feelings of depression and loneliness and have been openly communicating this. After an hour of me complaining and arguing, the aftermath turned into more crying and begging for forgiveness. 

Now, me and my partner have a healthy relationship, we communicate and take time to listen to each other. They know how to listen and handle me in a situation like this. But for some reason I was being completely difficult. Not returning calls or texts and crying outside on the curb of the street, writing my feelings down in a book.

After collecting myself, I realized how far i backtracked in progress and feel terrible. I was stable before this happened, what is  causing me to switch up so suddenly? How can I keep myself from sliding so far back in progress? 

(note: I hope this is enough context, if there is more needed I can explain)"
18y7n4y,Depression,2024-01-04,Suicide repercussions,Have you lost someone to suicide? How did you deal with it?
18y7m3n,Depression,2024-01-04,I just needed a rant,"I (18f) am currently a freshman in college and my goal since i was a child was to be a surgeon. I am the type of person that looks out for everyone, guides others through everything, keep everyone’s emotions in mind, etc. Throughout my entire life, everyone has taken advantage of me in different ways. Growing up, i had a very strong and mature personality that made people believe I was stronger than I was. People saw me as a leader and someone that doesn’t take shit from anyone. Unfortunately, I got severely depressed as I grew up and have been diagnosed with a few more disorders. They affect my everyday life. Along with that, almost everything I do is either diminished or copied by someone else that knows me. I did a program involving healthcare that i wanted to do for a few months and instead of people being happy, they copied me or changed the topic to them. Everything I do seems to grab negative attention which makes it so hard to continue. I’m usually so unlucky compared to those around me. It’s so hard to see people that don’t work as hard as me have a better outcome. I wish I could just leave because no one would even notice i was gone. I don’t have any actual friends or at least no close ones. I can never openly talk to someone. This makes everything so much harder. Due to all of this and much more i won’t disclose, I’m not sure what to do career wise because I don’t think i can handle needing assistance from my family that ruins my mental health until i’m done with residency which typically ends at 30 years old. If anyone has any advice or just a listening ear I would love to talk. If you read all of this, thank you so much."
18y7ilh,Depression,2024-01-04,"As I'm recovering from depression, my temper is getting worse","Hello. I (25M if it matters) have suffered from diagnosed mild and severe anxiety+depression for the last 10+ years starting when I was in my teens. I've had a lot of bullshit and trauma thrown my way throughout the years, but I've trekked along nonetheless. Fighting for my life and fighting that numbness alongside it has basically become a mundane yet daily task for me, and I had struggled in finding a way to properly cope with it. I tried everything, from working out and dieting, surrounding myself with loved ones, giving myself daily words of affirmation, doing something I loved every day, spending time with my pet, I tried therapy, I tried SSRI medication, I even tried practically drowning myself in alcohol for a year (obviously that wasn't going to help, but I was desperate for a solution), and nothing seemed to even slightly alter my brain pattern/the way I would think. (Don't worry, I've gotten the alcoholism under control as of now, thankfully)

However, this last year (and out of no where/for no reason), I actually had a few days, and sometimes weeks, where I would say I was feeling genuinely good about myself, and on those days/weeks, it no longer felt like I had that looming cloud hanging over my head, and I no longer felt numb. It was phenomenal, I felt like I was actually feeling my emotions again, and I do genuinely think that this was my brains way of attempting to rewire the chemical receptors into giving me the appropriate levels of ""happy-hormones"", and maybe I'm actually getting over my depression all these painful years later. But with all things ""too good to be true"", there's gotta be a catch, right?

I've noticed that, especially on the days where I am feeling better about everything, I have become extremely irritable, cold, and angry at anything. It could be something as simple and minute as someone not cleaning up after themselves, or as complex as having a difference in opinions about government types of my foreign friends. But regardless of what, it seems that literally anything could be enough to set me off into what I myself would label as a ""temper-tantrum"", where nothing can calm me down and everything/everyone in front of me is a problem, and I become a sort of ""ball of rage"", you could say.

The reason I'm writing anything about this is because of the fact that I haven't heard of/read of any similar situations amongst individuals who have suffered from depression (i.e. it doesn't seem like anyone else has experienced this: getting over depression, but immediately becoming so easily agitated at anything), so I have no guidance here, and no where to look for answers or a way to cope with/stop these bouts of anger. All I find when trying to look up information online is the complete opposite: people only experiencing extreme bouts of anger while depressed, not while getting better.

I am just so lost, and I hate that I take it out on people/things that obviously don't deserve that anger, and I know the people involved just want to help make me feel better. I'm just lost and unsure where to go and what to do. I do my best to contain the anger and, if absolutely necessary, I will isolate myself from others while I calm down to avoid unnecessary contention, but simply avoiding people isn't a great way to cope, I just know it sorta works for me right now.

I guess I'm just looking for some advice, or maybe to see if someone has gone/is going through something similar has some better coping mechanisms that work for them. I want to get better from my depression, but if it's going to make me so irritable with everyone around me, then that transition isn't worth it to me. These people don't deserve that anger directed towards them, and I'd rather sink deeper into my depression than take out my frustrations on people completely uninvolved. I am sorry for the long read, but obviously any advice is welcome."

When we talk on the phone they always tell me I'm a perfect fit and they can't wait to work me. The second they see me in person or over Zoom they get this really shocked look on their face and I feel like they try to rush me out of the interview sometimes because they want it to be over. I have zero tattoos or piercings and they never respond to any of my follow up emails or phone calls. I found out later on through friends that work there that the hiring manager is trying to keep the work place all or mostly white. I have a kid to take care of and I have no choice but to sell weed to make ends meet. I've been working with state organizations to help me get a job but nothing ever works out and when the state contacts these businesses to see why they won't hire me, the companies refuse to respond. Lately, I've been getting these violent urges that other people should feel the same pain I feel but I keep ignoring it.

This past year i’ve just been reentering the same harmful cycles that lead me to being on the verge of suicide and it seems like some real life change needs to happen. i’m only 16 and part of me thinks that my wanting to be hospitalized is just to escape life. to avoid school, and all the pressure i put on myself. 

probably the first step i should take is reaching out to my parents but it’s always so hard and shameful."
18y72yj,Depression,2024-01-04,"what do i do, i feel stuck","all i’ve known is some form of loneliness my entire life. i’ve always been an outcast despite my honest attempts at being kind, and i later found out it’s because i’m autistic, but still. my family neglected me growing up and still does, i had to raise myself. and my partner of three years is my best friend, but for some reason sucks at making me feel wanted or desired. trust me when i say i desperately try to go out of my way to make others not feel how i feel, and they love it, but i never ever receive anything back. im miserable. genuinely miserable. i have a cat that i love so very much, but he loves everyone else so much more than me. i have a job where one specific coworker goes out of their way to make it miserable to me. i wish i could’ve done something wrong to deserve this treatment, but then id know why people don’t like me and would take any chance at fixing that. i hate my life and im so insanely miserable but am such a coward and can’t off myself in anyway and i hate it. i try so hard to give life meaning but at every turn im reminded that maybe my life purpose is to off myself “for the greater good” like bringing my family together because of my death or some shit. how do i combat this? am i destined for this enormous amount of dread since i could remember? what do i do ?"
1919cty,Depression,2024-01-08,A Tragedy Of A Life,"I was relatively happy all throughout my life until the teenage years hit and I was in highschool. I was a bright, joyful, kind, funny, and adventurous child for the most part of my childhood. Of course I wasn’t perfect either I wasn’t always happy although I genuinely could say I had a good childhood.
Then 12 hit and I lost all of my friends. Every single one of them that remained in my life had left me. I went into a minor depression and cried at the end of the school year. I felt terribly empty which was such a drastic change from the previous year of 11 where I was filled with positive and negative emotions.

Then my life changed once again at 13 and I made friends and found a spot in the world again even at the local level of a school. I had a few friends to share conversations and laughs with and we would play card games together. I danced at the school party and things again were relatively well.

My life changed once again at 14 and this is where the serious problems came. I had fell into a deep depression for years and even attempted a cry for help which was a suicide attempt with sleeping pills. Just like when I was 12 I just didn’t feel like myself anymore. And this time it was much much worse and harder than when I was 12. At 14 I went to my first psych ward. Then 15 happened. 16 happened. 17 happened. Now this was during the covid pandemic and I was genuinely losing my mind not due to covid but due to the fact I was just near my breaking point mentally. I was requested to go to a special treatment center called residential and I would stay there for half a year. 

Now I’m 20 and nothings changed. I just want my life back again. I want to feel happy and smart again. I want to have good laughs and be the funny guy people adored. But I’m none of that now. I feel like I’m the lowest of the low value humans because no one really seems to care about me. I’m not even hated like a murderer or criminal I’m just nothing to people. And that might just be the most terrible thing that happened to me. The fact that no one wants to help me or at least knows how"
19193od,Depression,2024-01-08,I don't know where to go and i think I need someone to talk to.,I've unconsciously ruined my entire life.I have no one. I've lost my wife. My friends think I'm too sensitive because I'm a man. I have nothing left. I can't kill myself because I'm so scared to be dead and what if nothingness really happens. So I'm just stuck in this endless torture in my brain because that option isn't an option.  I'm in actual agony.
18y6xp0,Depression,2024-01-04,I’m alive-ish,"Back in 2021 on December 31st I planned on ending my life, I was in my car, parked by the lake in my hometown, last bad argument with my parents at home, knew it was my breaking point.  I sat in my car realizing what was going to happen, there was a moment where I couldn’t even hear the music playing, I was in a state of lost but aware. It was a few hours before the new year and I wanted it to be left behind. I got half way through with it but for some reason I started to think of my dog, my loved ones and wondered why put them through all the pain I feel just because I’m tired of life. I came home didn’t talk to anyone, had a rough week and thought it was all over, but here I am every January ever since then, I’ve literally had trouble sleeping, have flashbacks of that night, and idk why. Idk if it’s because I’m scared or what.If anyone has an explanation for why this is happening, I’d love the help. It gets worse every year, and it feels like guilt, but guilt of what, and why and I’m just confused."

I don't know what to do. I have all this negative and weird thoughts all the time, it's affecting my ability to work. I think my relationship is also going in the opposite direction. Nothing in my life is working out. I don't wanna feel this way.  I just some reassurance that we will get through this. How are you guys dealing with similar situations? My DMs are always open."

18y6nci,Depression,2024-01-04,Just venting about how depression affects my quality of life,"I'm currently a grad student (25F) finishing my masters. I have a semester long, full-time internship I am doing for my last semester, starting next week and I'm anxious. Since I've started grad school, my depression flare ups have been worse than ever. I'm scared how much worse it'll get when faced with the new schedule. I feel guilty for complaining about it at all because it makes me sound privileged and weak. I know I have to work to survive, but my soul feels like it's slowly leaving my body each year I live in this capitalistic hellscape. I see a psychiatrist every few months for med adjustments and maintenance. It's just difficult to exist with an invisible illness that impairs my ability to be/function like a human being. I feel like a burden to society and resentful that someone else's actions brought me into this world and now I have no choice but to struggle to survive until I cease to exist. It all feels so bleak."
18y6kqv,Depression,2024-01-04,Life is hard right now,"I have been depressed for a long time. I’ve been able to (somewhat) cope, but I’m starting to feel so restless and hopeless. For a while now I haven’t been able to really enjoy any activities or hobbies, it’s been hard to enjoy what I like about them, and so easy to see (or manufacture) negative things about them.

I’ve let my social network really deteriorate, especially over the last 2 years. I didn’t have close friends to begin with, but I moved far away from home and family with my girlfriend to a place that I really wanted to try living in and advance my career. I have not made a single friend in this new place. I almost never call or text my family, even though I have good relationships with everyone. I do fly out twice a year to visit which feels nice, but no one has come up to visit me even a single time, and deep down it has really bothered me. I know I can make better efforts on my part to improve communication with my family, but god damn, I feel lonely as shit.

I’m currently in the process of getting dumped by my girlfriend, who I’ve been in a relationship with for five years. We were supposed to get married, this shit sucks, and a lot of it is my fault. Two huge issues for all of our relationship have been her struggles with alcoholism, and my inability to handle problems in healthy ways. I’ve always been so quick to criticize her for small things, or question our relationship or suggest to break up at any setback that we’ve ever had, such as some of her drinking episodes. We might not be compatible as a couple due to her drinking habits (she doesn’t want to stop drinking despite acknowledging having a problem), but I regret how bad I’ve treated her in the past, especially for the last year. She’s a total sweetheart and I love her so much, but my actions and the way I speak to her haven’t always reflected that. I’m being eaten alive on the inside thinking about how I’ve treated her, and its so fucking awful that our relationship is ending even if it might be for the best.

I don’t know what I’m doing with my life. I don’t think I want to continue living in the place I’m at, but I also don’t want to move back home. I don’t want to make the effort to try to make friends, and I’m horribly lonely. I can’t find enjoyment in things that have previously made me happy. I know I’ll probably be okay, but I am really not well right now."
18y6hrm,Depression,2024-01-04,I like to see the world suffer,"I suffer 24 7 from extreme depression, when people die or get sick i feel some sort of satisfaction, especially when its the haters.

18y6fj3,Depression,2024-01-04,26 year old with a death wish and trust issues,"Yo so a dude 26 here from Russia. We don't have this concept here like you in USA but I am what you people would consider an inkel. Having had shitty experiences and plenty of trauma in the past I got a lot of hatred towards myself and others around me. Recently got into a ship with this 28 year old who finally gave me a chance out of desperation of something else. I cannot be with her I never had anyone before and I cannot ever have someone. I have a bad self image that jo matter how much therapy I do it's always coming back this mentality , no matter how much gym and pills and telling myself I will be happy with her won't undo years of porn damage and recently alcohol. I will never see a woman in the same light I did 4 years ago. I know people hate incels but I kinda hate myself too , lol killing myself will save me from a life of loneliness because I know I will never be happy next to someone knowing I missed out on so many things. No way.  I cannot be with her because I cannot allow (fool) myself to trust her ,be with her. Fuck I am so frustrated and angry. As a message before sleep"
18y6f57,Depression,2024-01-04,I'm gonna be 18 tomorrow and i think no one will notice if I'm gone.,"The past 2 months my life has fallen apart. People I thought were my friends don't talk to me anymore, if I don't talk first they won't talk to me. We're always on our phones but ya know, you have time for other people. They're always talking about how ""Oh we care"" but when someone shows actual problems no seems to care and just ignores it.

Other then school and work I'm just rotting in bed and not doing anything, I've tried to go out more and start new Hobbies but I always end up in the same spot staring aimlessly at a wall or doom scrolling in my phone.

Then when I do talk to people it never feels like they're there. I find more comfort in media (movies,books,shows) then people at this point because nothing they says feel real to me.

If I deleted all my accounts blocked peoples numbers and just stopped talking to people all together I don't think a single one would notice or care. Nearly none of them. I maybe have one person but I can't put all of this on them, they have they're own issues and life is hard enough for them, they don't need my shit too.

I don't think they'd even miss me tho... maybe this was more rambling then anything but I don't know where to put this and I don't even care if people anwser I just need my thoughts out."

18y6bsw,Depression,2024-01-04,"Struggling with Social Withdrawal, Self-Doubt, and Uncovering My True Self","I've been facing several challenges that I think some of you might relate to. Lately, I've become more withdrawn in social situations, quieter, and reflective, especially at night. This has led to a sense of deep loneliness and a loss of connections. Additionally, I struggle with expressing myself clearly in conversations. My mind often goes blank in social settings, which makes me feel less intelligent. However, in my dreams, I find myself using much more ""intelligent language"". It's like there's a more articulate, confident version of me that only comes out in dreams. Does anyone else experience this? Could this be the 'true me' that's hidden while I'm awake? I also have developed a dependency on listening to music to fall asleep. It's become a necessity for me; without it, sleep seems elusive."
18y6bid,Depression,2024-01-04,Support for boyfriend who suffers from depression,"Hello all! 

My boyfriend (29M) and I (28F) have been dating for 8 years. He has struggled with depression his entire life and sometimes I feel like I am failing him as a significant other. He shuts down when I try to talk about the future and recently told me that it is because he only has bad thoughts about the future. I struggle with mental health in other ways, but depression is not one of them which makes it hard for me to understand and support him (and sometimes I get offended that he won’t share because I take it personally — I know thats probably the worst thing to do and I am working on it!).

I try to be as supportive as I can be with the very little information he shares, but I would love to know if anyone can give me advice on how to support him (what to do when he is shutting down, what to say when he feels like he can’t share information with me because he doesn’t want to depress me, what to do when he sleeps for a week straight, etc). He really enjoys jiu jitsu, but he has not been going and I struggle to know how hard to push him to go because I know it helps his mental health. He has also tried therapists in the past and says that “talking to someone doesn’t help him”. I think that he has just had the wrong therapist, but he insists that it is just not for him. 

Any and all advice is highly appreciated. It breaks my heart that he and others feel so incredibly down — I really just want to have the tools to be as supportive as possible to the love of my life and others in similar positions! 

Stay strong everyone ♥️"
1919dz2,Depression,2024-01-08,Keep thinking about killing myself,Super long story not worth telling. I have a shoot gun in the other room the keeps calling me. But I don't want to do it in my parents house. I do have to do a long drive on the 20th and I'll be stopping by Horse shoe bend. I am thinking about jumping off right there. It honestly doesn't matter. I fear death but only of knot knowing what happens after we die. Is it lights are out or is it like how you disconnect a TV. Either way I honestly been thinking jumping off the cliff at horse shoe bend alot . Sad thing is I recently had to put down a family pet and saw the pain my mom went through and it hurt alot. I can't imagine what she will be going through when I am gone not to mention my kids. But honestly I am tired boss and when I heard the relief my dog made when we put him to sleep it felt peaceful.  Thats all I want is to be at peace and  happy.

1917jfd,Depression,2024-01-08,If things don’t change for the better by 2025 I think I’m going to plan to kill myself,"I’m sick and tired of struggling with my depression. I’ve been at this for what feels like my entire life and finally getting official treatment for 2 years now. I’m already sick of the meds, sick of the therapy, I’m sick of the same struggle. I hate living like this. I stopped taking my meds for the third time this year (I was taking them faithfully the first year) and I just feel like the depression will always exist in me. Which just makes me so much more depressed. 

Feels like I’m living a nothing life. 

It hit me hard today. It’s my day off from work that I’d been looking forward to and I just feel nothing except numbness. Don’t even feel the desire to do anything for myself I’d like to. Feel like such a failure at living lol.

Just took a night walk in the cold to try and feel better with some music. But it just made me feel sadder. I kept wishing something would kill me on the walk.

Anyway, I’m tired of it. 

This is the first time I’m really considering suicide to the point of an actual plan and time. I’m giving myself this year to make things better and keep trying. But if I fail again honestly this world has so much awfulness in it, it’s not worth going anymore to experience it’s shittiness along with struggling so much on the inside too. 

Happy New Year."
190xp4h,Depression,2024-01-07,Tonight’s Heavy,"I feel heavy, like I can’t be lifted up. Nothing in particular happened but I guess I just feel so disappointed with reality, where my life is and how things are. It comes and goes and some days are better but it just sucks being here, and feeling this weight pushing me downwards, making me feel like I’m sinking and drowning. From the outside people think I’m cheery and fun but I honestly put on a mask and feel so lonely and find it so hard to confide in people. A lot of the experiences I’ve had when I just needed somebody to be there end up being looked at differently, so I keep having to hold it in and just keep pretending to be ok. I can’t even cry when I need to anymore unless I express myself like this and my voice starts shaking. I’m just really tired of the feeling and holding onto so much when I really want to let it all go.

I just needed to air it out today, more than usual I suppose. Maybe it’ll help me."

190ks8w,Depression,2024-01-07,Hello,"I have never posted on Reddit before so apologies if my formatting seems strange or awkward. I just need advice, of any kind. I’m at point in my life where I feel as though my time is up. I have struggled with severe depression amongst other things since I was around 15 (21 (f) now.))This is something that has honestly crippled me and the way I interact with people, and how I function in my day to day life. Because of the way I was raised and how I saw my parents deal with similar issues (usually by ignoring them and just powering through) I’ve downplayed how much I’ve really been hurting, pretended that I was totally fine and now I feel like no one will take me seriously. I have an incredibly hard time following through with important life events, I have registered for college multiple times and each time ends with me starting out on track with perfect grades and ends with me convinced that there is no point in finishing because I won’t be able to do it, that I don’t deserve to finish. I don’t know why I respond this way, I feel humiliated and ashamed by being so behind my peers, and by having to confess this to my parents each time. I don’t think that I am much more than just a disappointment to them anymore. I’m living at home right now, with both of my parents (43) and my two younger brothers (13 &amp; 15.) Right now I am planning my suicide, something I’ve known would happen for years. I’ve been planning it for a couple of weeks but it’s  culminating right now after a conversation with my dad, after he told me how hurt he was that I lied about trying in school again, how disappointed he is in me, how he doesn’t have any compassion anymore, he just feels angry. I had the first panic attack I’ve had in years, which he scoffed at and did not believe was real, and am now contemplating what I should do. Obviously there is so much more that has happened throughout my life that has led me to feeling like this is my last option, but I guess that’s the situation right now. I can’t stop crying because I know that there are things that I am good at, that I love to do, that I have genuine passion for, things that I want to learn and try, but I’m just stuck in this place where everything is out of my reach and I have no one to pull me out, and I don’t deserve to be pulled out. I don’t have any friends in the area that I live in, but even if I did I don’t think I would reach out. My greatest grievance in life is that I inevitably burden the people I love by not growing like I’m expected to. I have so much sadness inside of me and I don’t know what to do with it. I never want to burden anyone with the responsibility of having to make me feel okay again, because it really isn’t anyone’s responsibility but my own. I have never really been able to talk about how I’m feeling or ask for help, I have so much internal shame for not just being normal, and when I’ve tried in the past the people around me just don’t understand. I’m not in a relationship right now, a year ago I thought I had found the love of my life but we are no longer on speaking terms. I can’t talk to my parents about how I am feeling, they are burnt out from me and I don’t know if they would believe me anyways. I hate myself so much for even having these feelings in the same house as my little brothers, I hate that I might have had any negative influence on them. Right now I am trying to think of ways to leave where no one would notice, until I was really gone. Where they wouldn’t have to find me. Opposed to other times in my life I don’t really want to do this, but I feel like it’s the only option I have. I wasted all of my good time not being as good as I could be, and now I’m done. Honestly despite this completely overwhelming feeling that this is all that I can do, that this is all that I deserve, there is a tiny voice somewhere that is asking if I can start over and just try something different. I just don’t know which feeling I should listen to. I don’t have any real resources, I just started saving money after paying for a semester of college that I didn’t complete. I don’t have anyone to turn to who can comfort me or give me advice or just tell me what to do. I’m in a hole that is really hard to get out of and I don’t know if I can ever feel like a normal person again. I don’t expect anyone to read all of this, and I’m sorry if there are any grammatical errors. I just felt like maybe I could share how I was feeling to something at least once."

I have been prescribed by my doctor some anti-depressives. 
The course is called lexamil.

This is my first time ever being on Anti-depression pills so I need some opinions, recommendations, etc to make sure that they are as effective as they should be. 

What time of the day would you recommend?

I have quit drinking already so that isn't really a concern on my part."

18y5wdu,Depression,2024-01-04,I hate,"I hate having feelings, I hate having a brain. I wish I didn’t have one, I hate being so old. Even though I’m not, but this is the oldest I’ve ever been. I hate it, I hate growing up, I hate getting older I hate being here. It’s so boring, it’s not fun. But the thing I hate, the thing I hate most in this world right now.. is my heart, it’s left me astray. In love with my best friend, being in love isn’t worth it. I’m not worth loving, I’ve waited three years without even knowing and all of a sudden I feel my representations. He did this to me, I hate. I hate him, I love him so much it hurts. Not like people think, not normal pain. My chest physically aches it becomes so unbearably painful and my whole body genuinely shakes and breaks from all this heart ache. He started all this and never planned it through, now I sit here and suffer. Miserable everyday because I cannot have him, but he pretended to give me the chance. I wanna die, I wish it had worked. Why does it never work, I hate myself. I hate what I’ve become."
18y5uh3,Depression,2024-01-04,It’s so hard,"This past month I’ve been working on myself and I’ve stopped a lot with the self negative talk. That was a huge thing I would do to myself almost anytime I was alone. I’ve finally been progressing and feeling better about myself. But the one thing that will never change is my sister. I love my sister so much but I know she will never feel the same. Growing up she has been my only friend to stick with me. And she uses that as a weapon. Anytime I ask her something she has a tendency to yell back at me right in my face and add an insult. A lot of these insults are stuff I say to myself. And it’s not funny to me at all. She knows all of this. And she uses it against me. My mom stopped telling me all those horrible stuff a few weeks ago, except for when she told me to kms because  “I got her sick”? But otherwise she leaves me alone. This weekend I’m going to get my license after postponing it for years and I was so proud of myself. Right now I don’t wanna do anything and I wanna just disappear."

I’ve tried many different medications, therapies and other methods to try to help over the years but nothing seems to work long term. I’m tired of trying so hard to improve myself for nothing to change. The more I try to do better in public the worse I end up feeling overall. Anytime I experience a bit of happiness it seems like my body has to cancel it out by giving me a major depressive episode later on while I’m by myself. I want to experience joy without the depression

I'm drunk at the moment however I've found myself back into a deep slump this time I'm deliberately doing things I know will make people hate me.
Today I told my girlfriend I did not respect her and I was only in it for her body. This was a lie...
I said these things with one single thing in mind, make her hate me. She is now my ex girlfriend so I think I'm pretty good at whatever this new ""symptom"" is.
As for another example, my best friend was talking to me, attempting to liften my spirits, build me up by any means necessary. And I just spit in his face (not literally of course) I showed immense disrespect and now we're not talking.
There is a general anger targeted towards everyone, but I don't believe my intentions are formed from a hate of others, rather a hate for myself.

My head filled with all the mistakes I've made. Tomorrow promising to be an even longer, tiring day because of not being able to sleep right now.

And even if I sleep I'm just condemned to repeat the same mental anguish I went through today. And the day before that, and the day before.

It's not living to spent each day like this, and it's cruel that I can't just die. And it's even crueler that this is life for years to come.

Please, I just wanna die."

I watch all of these videos that give tips on dealing with loneliness, anxiety, depression, etc and I just don’t buy that any of that shit works at this point. I’ve had enough breathing exercises, mediation, and “it gets better” speeches. All I am able to do right now is sit and think about every mistake and fuck up I’ve made in recent and not so recent history. Why would I not anticipate that trend to continue? Everything I have read tells you it gets better. What no one tells you is it never really goes away, ever. That’s quite the miserable existence if you ask me, and I feel so very frustrated by that. If anyone can share some words of wisdom, it would be appreciated."

I hate that I started doing this cause family now see me as different but I don't know how to get away from it. I don't like doing it I even hate pain but its better pain than what's inside my head.

I have also been making efforts of being more active in online communities like discord channels and subreddits of interest and just simply talk to people that way which has also been very helpful.

I look into the mirror and I just wish whoever is staring back at me would stop living because it’s not me. I am a complete shell of who i once was and i will never be able to be as proud of myself as much as i once was. I feel like im in an endless spiral of living the same day every day and it’s exhausting. i don’t want to live the same day everyday now so i can finish growing up and do the same thing everyday again.

18y43y5,Depression,2024-01-04,Treatment burnout?,"What do you do when you feel hopeless, treatment-wise? 

Over 2023, I had 4 psychiatrists, got off and on 3 different antidepressants (cymbalta, pristiq, prozac) and 4 anti anxiety meds, had to change therapists (she moved!), went to and completed a PHP / IOP, and did ketamine treatment. I quit my job in March of '23 largely because of depression and unfortunately, though I've spent a lot of time treating myself over the past 9 months, I've just gotten worse and worse. 

My doctor's recommending another full change of medication and I'm scared. I'm also scared of continuing ketamine because it's making me more anxious. I feel hopeless and pessimistic, like I'm drowning. I feel like my doctors aren't looking out for me and they keep rolling me through the next bullshit, regardless of the side effects. Though I don't know what else to do and I feel like my pessimism and fear is the problem.

18y3qm8,Depression,2024-01-04,Feeling depressed but I don't understand why,"I would like to blame Christmas and New Year. I know the concept that people stay with other people during Christmas or New Year's Eve is.... not true. It's not natural. It might be something traditional, but considering the fact that many things we considered traditional are actually made up no longer than 200 years ago.... You know what I mean. I knew it's totally fine for being alone, I'm alone during other days anyway, but I hate myself for still influenced by the concept that I should be with other people because it's Christmas/New Year/holiday....etc.

I am alone during my winter break because I have no friend and my family live in another country. The beginning of it was fine. I took a three-day trip to another city. The trip was nice, I went to some parks and saw some old buildings. I think the problem is me. I don't know how to enjoy a trip. When I saw the lake, some trees or beautiful buildings, I didn't feel anything special, or the strong feeling ""how beautiful it is!!"". The input was lake (or anything else) and the output was also lake. It's just a lake for me. So I ended up walking a lot because I felt boring when seeing one scenic spot for too long... like, literally five minutes. The view was nice but I didn't find it interesting. Somehow I feel that my sanity was going to explode if the trip was longer than three days.

And now I feel like I have lost my energy. Not able to move. Take a lot of effort to go off bed to get water or something. I can't concentrate even if I'm watching some mindless TV show instead of books..or other things. I have stuffs that I should do or better have them done during the holiday ... would be nice for the future me. But I don't have energy. And I don't understand why. I stayed home after my short trip. I slept until I woke up and could fall asleep again. I read some books (only two, actually). I wrote my thoughts on a notebook. I didn't do anything related to my study (which I should). And somehow still tired. I can't understand myself.

And btw my New Year wish is either my brain become normal or just let me die through some accidents(maybe) before the end of the year."

Idk it didn't sound like I wrote it but it was practically what they said. They have their own issuse and find feelings to be an uncomfortable topic.

18yia8f,Depression,2024-01-04,I just have no desire to live,"I'm a 26 year old male and am more or less a failure in my life. No job, no real friends, can't drive, no hobbies, no skills or talents. I've been unemployed for over a year after being let go from my first job after graduating from university, after just 8 months. I was incompetent at that job and I'm sure I only got it in the first place because the hiring manager took pity on me.

 I've been revising my resume and sending it out since then but I haven't managed to get an offer anywhere. I've even been sending it to nearby retail positions just to get something, anything, to no responses. I went to university and graduated but I basically have no real skills and didn't retain anything from my education. Despite attending every class, taking notes and trying hard to learn I would still do poorly or outright fail classes. It took me 7 years to graduate because I failed a program requirement twice in a row. I think I'm just low IQ. Everyone I know is doing well for themselves but I am constantly failing at everything.  
So because I haven't had a job in a year I've basically used up all of the savings that I had to support myself and am now surviving off of credit to pay rent and afford food and digging myself into more debt. Even if I got a job I don't know how I would recover financially especially since with my lack of intelligence there's no way I am qualified for anything more than minimum wage. Not to mention things like rapid inflation and climate change; it all just leaves me completely hopeless for the future. I have no drive or desire to do anything and am just tired. I don't think I want to actively die right now but if I were hit by a car or just passed in my sleep silently I wouldn't mind, honestly. Probably nobody would know if I died in my unit until rent was missed anyway."

I have no love life and I don't even care at this point, the whole dating scene for people around my age is fucked anyways and everyone these seems to be extremely shallow so I lost any motivation to pursue intimacy despite how much I desire it.

I recently got fired from an office job for low performance only after 2 1/2 months and everything on indeed requires me to have some sort of certification or be bilingual which I’m not. And if I find a job I’ll probably just get fired again even though I do my jobs diligently or it’s not going to pay enough to get an apartment. As I say many times to my mom, I am going to unalive myself one of these days, (I am bipolar and been taking medications for years) she told me today to go ahead and do it. She told me no one at home likes to be around me. Then she said get a life on my way out of the room. This triggered me heavily and confirmed I don’t have my mothers support at all. I have 3 cats and am unable to go to a shelter because I love my cats to just part from them. I am not sure what to do. I know I must sound pathetic. But at this point I have no other family to turn to and have no friends. If I rehome my cats and leave, I’ll end up on the streets anyway.

18y2fjt,Depression,2024-01-04,I don't wanna die but I see no other way out of this,"At 35 I have now lost everything.  
  
My apartment, savings, friends, failed studies and unemployed for over three years.  
  
Got diagnosed with epilepsy about three years ago and the medication changed me forever. Of course I was gaslighted by doctors who dismissed my symtoms. Everything was just blamed on my anxiety, that it all started and got more intense directly when I started my seizure medication wasn't relevant.  
  
Later I was in a car accident with a rib fracture and news that I have a benign brain tumor.  
  
On top of all this I am an unemployed man at 35 with a porn addiction and never had a relationship. Forced to move back in with my parents when all of this happened. I'm a cliché. A bitter man in his 30's who has never had a relationship and lives with his parents, self isolating in his room and procrastinate because too overwhelmed.  
  
My anxiety is so extreme I cant handle simple tasks or jobs that society demands from you in order to properly function and build a life worth living.  
  
I have tried getting help for this but there is none. I have been on and off psychiatric help now from these 3 years. Now a referal that I have waited over 9 months to even get a simple therapist to talk to.  
  
I'm desperate and want help! You read and hear everywhere that help exist?! What kind of help? I have tried to reach out for help for over three years! But when they don't believe you? What to do then?  
  
I want to live a fulfilling life. But due to a damaged brain due to past trauma and lots of other factors. I simply cannot take this anymore. Insomnia every day and I'm so damaged I don't function in social settings. It's a clear difference between how people treat me before and after all of this happened. I am far too broken to be fixed and trying to help me get back on my feet is waste of resources.  
  
Honestly, what help exist? I am having yet another mental breakdown. Just give me pills and a goodbye? My problems is too complex that no pill in the world can fix. Also scared due to doctors gaslighting bad side effects on medication.  
  
Is there actually another way out of this other than to end it all forever? (I have a plan and know exactly how)"

18y1w1r,Depression,2024-01-04,Hi all.,"English isn’t my first language, sorry if there is any kind of mistake on the grammar. 
Well, I’m planning to kill myself; I don’t have a reason no more since I’m from south-America but I’m earning really good money, I live in a medium-high neighborhood, I’ve got a wealthy business and I’m only 24 years old (today is my birthday). 
Im struggling since I was born until my 23… I cut any kind of contact with my real family cuz that ppl sux, just my dad and he isn’t that good but he respect me since we used fight and I won every time… I was kinda adopted by my best friend family and even thought I tattooed myself a picture w/ them, they’re really nice and I’ve living w/ them but I always have felt like I’m not fitting there. That’s why I moved out to a different city to be a bit more comfortable, however and like I said, I don’t have any debt, I got my own bike to move from job to my house (I’ve working in a really nice place for the last two year) but I feel completely empty, I’m not able even to cry, I don’t like to talk about this (and that’s why I chose this place, cuz anyone would notice my identity) but I’ve feeling like my thoughts are mine, I got like a voice that can’t control anything but feelings, is like a crazy ass dog mauling everything on me. I just got three friends (and the one that I hang out the most didnt even tell me hbd, but that’s ok). We’re always joking about suicide but they don’t know that I really want to do it. I really feel like is the best option. I can’t deal with myself no more, everything around me is great but me, I used to take meds but it didn’t work neither. 

Also, my weight is 120+ kg so fatty ppl here understand how hard this shit hits, girls don’t see me at all, I tried to get tinder dates but you know, I just made matches with trans (I mean there isn’t anything wrong with them, but that’s not what I’m looking for). 

However, I know you guys may are living a harder life than me, but isn’t about life anymore is about to avoid my feelings and thoughts, I’ve dealing with it for a long time now but I feel things are not going to be nice anymore, this is kind of my last scream for help cuz I just need an excuse; once I got it I’ll try to take all the sleeeping, mental, hearth, blood pressure, weight burners that i got to die in piece cuz I’m too fking coward to crash on my bike (I tried to gang myself in dads house but I failed obviously, I remember the feeling as today, it was just horrrible)."
18y1sc7,Depression,2024-01-04,Tapering off Buspar and Sertraline at the same time,"Has anyone else tapered off both of these medications at the same time. I’ve already talked to my doctor and she said I can taper off of them, but I didn’t clarify if I should taper off both at the same time or taper off one and then the other to allow my body more time to adjust and let it adjust to reduction of one first before I taper off the other.  

Any help is appreciated.

190zyh5,Depression,2024-01-07,Waking up every morning in tears,"Every morning I wake up, I have been experiencing depressive episodes with my face flooded in tears. I am constantly reminded of how alone I am in this world. 

It feels so pointless being alive and having no one to talk to about my deepest feelings. I am fully aware that having a gf would not solve my problems, but it would feel so nice to have some resemblance of validation in my life. I will most likely end up killing myself before the year is over.

Seeking professional help and taking medication has not helped at all. It only made me more suicidal than before. 

 I am convinced that I am unlovable and undesirable. Despite efforts to work on myself, such as going to the gym and losing weight, both guys and girls in my age group have made fun of me for being ugly and told me that I would never enter a relationship."

I went on one visit, she prescribed me medication and I stopped taking it because I found comfort in feeling like shit everyday for some reason. I have no idea what’s wrong with me, teachers can’t go easy on me because I have no proof that there’s something wrong with me mentally, I can’t study because I have concentration problems and I struggle with procrastination, I can’t get out of bed to go to school and my problems are just getting bigger and worse everyday. I have mood swings all the time. I shift from being happy and energetic to being depressed and suicidal, which is why I don’t know if I’m depressed or just sad sometimes and lazy. I take pills after drinking alcohol or several energy drinks to raise the chances of dying from a heart attack or something. I don’t wanna be poor and struggle with life in the future, but I feel like there’s really nothing I can do at this point. I wont get accepted to a good school with grades like this. I struggle with self harm, I’m insecure, I’m bad at school and I feel like my life’s over. My mom doesn’t really care either, her abusive boyfriend who ruined my life said that he hopes that I die. She broke up with him and two weeks later she got back with him again. Im tired."

18y1mjp,Depression,2024-01-04,Really dark place at the moment - but haven’t given up,"I feel like I need to share this somewhere, with someone and absolutely anyone that’s willing to hear it.

I’ve never been able to be true to myself because I do not know how, or understand how to be someone with true intentions.

The thoughts keep me up all night every night. I write this at 2am as I’m supposed to start work at 7am. I’m 26 years old and I’m going through the darkest period of my life.

Over Christmas, me and my girlfriend of 6 months have just split over what seemed like a silly argument but has actually highlighted that I’ve been pretending to love her all this time. The relationship was built on me needing the love off someone but not being able to return it, and everything that came with has been a convenience for me like being able to go to her place and get away from home. I am only just confronting this now, and the damage that it’s done to not only me but her. Even now we are speaking about how to start again and patch things up but I know this is not coming from a place of true love and deep down I know that I need to confront myself and break this off altogether but both our sake. I’m just afraid of the isolation but that is no excuse for the pain I’ve caused and would cause going forward.

Furthermore I’ve developed a dependency on alcohol. I’ve always been one too take it too far when drinking recreationally but now it’s getting out of control, using it to numb my thoughts and help with my sleeping/insomnia.

I’ve always lied in previous relationships and told “little ones” in my current but the biggest lie is the false foundation which is built and to myself. I’ve lied to parents and I’ve lied to work friends and family.

Right now I’ve gone past the point of caring about anything. I used to get sleep anxiety but I don’t care how much sleep I get now or how I’m using alcohol as long as I turn up to work. I feel and have been isolated over Christmas and New Year. And I feel I deserve it. I feel I don’t deserve happiness within myself for all the lies I’ve told and hurt I’ve caused. 

BUT I haven’t given up hope over a serious future for myself. I still live at home with parents and am planning to move out this year and believe it’s possible. I’m still going to the gym 3/4 times a week and working hard towards my fitness goals. I have other prospects I’ve put off because of all the stress but plan to pick these up again very soon.

Although I have had suicidal thoughts, and attempted it once for various reasons in the past, I haven’t given up hope for a future. All in all I’ve been suffering clinical depression for a long time but my hope is always there to defeat it, it’s just that I feel like I’m always making things worse for myself due to my decision making and not being true to who I really am. 

The older I get the more experience I thought I would get to make better decisions and become a person I could be proud of, but I keep doing the wrong things and it’s like a tight rope round my neck getting tighter and tighter every time. I’m not good at talking and really don’t want to take this to work at all, but I’m almost feeling there’s little options if I want to take the time out to confront this once and for all and start making step by step actions to get out of this. Thanks for reading."

18y1c7b,Depression,2024-01-04,"26 yo male, struggling, worried about future, need advice.","Growing up I was pretty normal until middle school ish. I was an A+ student and a stand out athlete, but eventually anxiety had over taken everything. By the time HS rolled around I couldn't function in sports, couldn't present to class, couldn't go to restaurants etc etc etc. Discovered after HS I had anxiety issues after talking with my mom and finding out genetically there's some issues on both sides of the family but I suffered in silence from the age of 11.

I've tried like 10 different SSRIs/SNRIs/Tri-Cyc meds since 2017 and I've tried Ketamine treatment to no avail. This anxiety and a little sadness from it had turned into bad, full blown depression around 2019. The only thing that worked was a low dose of Ativan(only benzo I've used). All my buddies seem to either smoke weed, drink, or do party drugs to cope or they just exist and do ok. I think the meds have done permanent damage to where I've gotten worse in a way.

Has anybody had anything help outside of traditional treatments? Maybe the Saint Protocol TMS? Please don't tell me things like diet, exercise, church, meditation etc tried it all. Im at a good weight, I go to gym 3-4 days a week, got into counseling, I have a great wife and a great kid, $ saved up and a nice house but I'm reeling. Any insight would be appreciated, I'm running out of options and I can only think to blame the meds for being the nail in my coffin."
18y1b0z,Depression,2024-01-04,I told my therapist everything and couldn’t feel worse,"TW: mental health distress, suicide mention

Hi all. For some context I’m 17m and autistic.

Ive suffered with severe anxiety/depression all my life, and didn’t have a great childhood (divorced parents, awful stepdad until he left when I was 12, bullied by family). I was always blamed for being anxious and received no emotional support. Even though it was clear I had developmental problems, no one actually bothered to pursue any sort of support for me. 

Ive been getting pretty unreliable support from CAMHS (UK’s infamous youth mental health services) and I get about 2 - 4 sessions a month.

Today I was completely honest. I told my therapist that I feel as though I cannot ever be happy. I’ve never been content in life and constantly behind my peers. I don’t enjoy things and for YEARS the only thing that’s kept me going was the false hope that things would get better. 

I cannot hold a job or stay in education. I am severely depressed. I told my therapist that I’ve been thinking about suicide almost everyday for the last 2 or so years. 

She asked me whether I could keep myself safe and I said ‘I think I’m scared to say no because I don’t know what will happen’. She explained risk assessments and stuff and I just felt so bad.

I told her that I just feel like a lost cause. I feel like someone is inherently wrong with my brain and I’m unable to feel joy. I feel so lonely and upset. 

I have severe panic attacks and can barely be in a car for more than 10 minutes. I feel crippled by my anxiety and mental health struggles. People say that I need to give it time and how I’m really resilient, but I’ve been suffering for SO FUCKING LONG. I’m not succeeding anyway. The only reason I’m here is that I’m too chicken to kill myself. I don’t see that as strength.

I’m traumatised, depressed, and frankly I’ve given up on the hope that it’ll get better. 

The only option I have is to suffer or die. 

The worst thing is I don’t even think CAMHS is gonna do anything unless I actually go through with something. I’m trapped in an endless cycle of pain. I WANT to be better and get better.

I’m on meds and I think they need to change (150mg of Sertraline a day for about a year).  

I need some hope. I feel so helpless. What reason is there to continue when I feel so inherently broken. I’m so ashamed."
18y1a82,Depression,2024-01-04,Idk what to put here,I am young 13 and I have depression I have thoughts on doing it but I won’t because it will just hurt my family more. I am afraid of telling it to people because I think they will just say it’s not serious… I am not well but I am afraid of hurting my family because my sister tried it before and I think my family can’t handle it. Life is just to hard for me already I just want to be liked and be good but it’s hard everything is hard.
18y17jd,Depression,2024-01-04,I've just been so sad lately.. I can't stop thinking about her. She's gone and its my fault.,"I wanted to tell someone about this because the situation is weird in my life.. But hopefully someone will read this and maybe you can help me.. Or I can help you. Anyway. MY 16m. I'm home schooled and I used to be in a group of homeschoolers. I met my best friend there. She was... Well she was amazing. And we talked SOO much. I never got tired of talking to her. Eventually, We told each other how we felt. And that was so amazing. But her being 15 and I 16 things didn't go to well. Both our families and ourselves are religious and its sort of customary to start dating at 16. Her parents did not like me. They would not let us hang out unless there were more then 3 other people with us. We made it work though. We never kissed or went on any actual dates. But we held hands and cuddled up when we could. One day... We stayed up a little to late.. Things kinda got spicy. Well spicy for a religious kid anyway. I sent her some photos of me without a shirt and she too screen shots or our conversations that were.. Basically just sexting. And then a few days pass.. Her mom was trying to download some files or something with her phone and found the folder with the screen shots. And things went downhill. We weren't able to talk for a few days. But eventually we started talking to each other in secret. We started sneaking out and that's when We started kissing. We went out for up to 5 hours in the middle of the night being all over each other. But... It wasn't right. It took off chunks of my morality and made me feel..sick. I couldn't handle this secret relationship. Honesty means a lot to me. And her going against her parents... sneaking out and doing things wasn't right. I had to call it off. Her tears made me sad. Her mom asked her why she was crying. She told her that I called and asked for a second chance, that only made me more upset as she was telling a big fat lie to her mom again. I was in pain for a few days but then recovered. But lately... I keep hearing or seeing her name.. I can't stop thinking about her. Its been affecting my sleep. I cry myself to sleep and when I can't cry I'm crying on the inside. I just want to hold her in my arms again. I want to hear someone tell me they love me and I actually know that its true. Not some stranger on the internet. Not my parents telling me they love me. I know they do but I want to be loved by someone who wants to marry me. I'm afraid I'll never have someone like her again. But at the same time she wasn't good for me. I'm being pulled in a billion different directions. I wish I could change the mistakes I made. I want her back. I want to be loved again. I don't know what to do. I'm just so sad. I'm sorry betsy.. I'm sorry."

190jdoq,Depression,2024-01-07,What am I supposed to do im going crazy. Please help.,"Im 14 years old, I have many neurological problems. I feel they've ruined my life. No body in my life ever understands. that might sound cringey but its true. I have misophonia a issue that causes people to hate certain sounds to the point of high anger and violence or just completly breaking down. Its usually chewing But for me its starting to feel like everything is making me incredibly angry. Like eating, talking, my siblings fighting, my dad typing, my baby brother screeching, my sister on the phone, the vacuum, crickets, birds, pens, breathing, opening your mouth, and classical music. Like violins and stuff. There is way more but i just cant think of them. I get so upset. I think about horrible violent ways to get rid of the sources of the noise. Ive thought of murding my family members in high detail. Ive thought about sticking sharp objects in my ears and alot more. I dont mean to think it, it just happends and i wish it would stop. My family only makes this issue ten times worse. Ive told them about it they know. Ive stressed it so many times but they just dont care. They eat with their mouths open and make the most horrible noises. I always remind them but I think they hate me. They say im always ""bossing them around."" I just don't want to end up hurting them.  My little brother 9yrs always gets mad when i tell him to stop. Hes started using it against me and making chewing noises to make me mad. I thought my little sister understood (11yrs) she usually doesnt make noises too often but shes recently telling me im ""fucking"" annoying and I should just stay in my room. She has a cussing problem. Im always in my room. Its very colorful and has many decorations and lights ive put up, I do art and create things to distract me from life because im mostly always upset. I thought I was getting better these couple of months. Heres a little background information. I have misophonia which i explained but i also have other things like, dyslexia, synesthesia, also i have some sensory issues like touching cerbtain texures make me wanna die. and im starting to see things that arent real. Ive had synesthesia all my life just thought it was normal, devopled misophonia in the 6th grade and my mom realized my dyslexia in the 2nd grade. Ive pretty much been depressed and not knowing how to deal with these problems since the start of middle school. Ive felt like im in a bubble for so long. Everything feels fake. My head feels like a kaleidoscope consistently spinning with color and noise. I dont know how to deal with all these underlying problems. Ive gone to therapy only because I tried to off myself in may. And my mom basically forced me when i got out of the mental hospital. I feel like a part of me starting feeling fake after the hospital it didnt feel real. We did the same thing everyday and werent really allowed to discuss our issues. How were supposed to learn to cope with something we didnt understand. After the hospital it felt weird. So lately ive been waking up early having a generally ""good"" schedule. I feel like i have more creativity but today I was really ticked off. Now i feel myself slipping. Like this will just happen again and again get better get worse get better get worse.  I dont know anymore i feel like im living a lie. Like my ""getting better"" really isnt getting better its just ignoring everything and delusion. Ive tried therapy 2 times. One where i talk to this lady and she gives me affirmations to repeat over and over and over untill I believe it. Which.. Is for self esteem which yes I suffer with bad self esteem but that isnt the bigger issue. Also the questions she asked me were so incredibly stupid. There were also so easy. Like "" describe a time you felt upset"" but, every time i cant answer. I cant form words its a mental block. I never got over it. I hated it. Didn't last 2 days. My oyher therapy was for sensory problems. Its was the most stupid thing you could ever imagine. Listen i have problems like, hotter water makes me feel weird, I cant touch grease or do the dishes. Or touch certain materials. I used to hate jeans as a kid because the feeling. Anways she tried to get me to get a waited blanket because that will help me? Im pretty sure it wont. Now i always tell my mom she says stupid stuff and she says "" why dont you tell her you think it wont help"" i did. She went in a  snotty voice and told me ""well there are people who study this so yeah it will"". Didnt last a day. I hate therapy and i dont see it helping me. Everyday feels fake. I dont think im supposed to exist. Its not right. I wonder if im a reincarnated convict. Forced to live with this because i did something wrong in my past. What the hell do i do. I feel so far gone. 



There are probably spelling mistakes in here and alot of ""i's"" that are not capital. Im too lazy to go and fix it.

Im also struggling with sleep i cant sleep because im afraid of having more paralysis. Im also paranoid like someone is looking at me. I taped my window curtains so there are no gaps. And i sometimes see the walls move. Theres more but my fingers hurt.


I dont know what to do."
18y0m6i,Depression,2024-01-04,How to cope?,How do you cope with depression and being bored of life?? I don’t know what to do anymore
18y0hna,Depression,2024-01-04,15M I don't understand that at my age I can hate myself so much,"I'm 15 years old and yet I already want to end it, when I started middle school (I'm French so I don't know if middle school means the same thing for others but it was when I was 12-13 years old) It was great but halfway through my first year I fell in love with a boy who was straight, he was great with me and didn't take it badly that I was in love. But I had a friend and when I came out to him he took it badly and distanced himself from me (he's Muslim so I don't know if I can really blame him) He had been my best friend for years so I was really sad. Then 1 year later I was alone because he had completely abandoned me, I saw lots of people with their friends and I was all alone, I was really very sad and I hadn't loved myself for years: my head, my stomach, my thighs, my body, everything is ugly about me, years ago I was harassed by a guy who lives his best life while forgetting the harm he did to me. Anyway, so I didn't like myself at all, I was alone and sad so sometimes I hurt myself, the next year it was the same but worse, and the guy who harassed me told my girlfriend that I harassed him, anyway you know what I mean. In the same year my girlfriend and I left but it didn't affect me more than that because I had my friends, the best I had, especially Mathilde, I loved her so much but she was from a higher class so the following year I no longer had this friend, I had another and she was incredible but she wanted to put herself first. I was also in a relationship, this relationship completely broke me, she was a girl who acted cute and nice but it was quite the opposite, I had to obey her but I decided to end it and I was happy but at the same time not because I was still sad and I still hurt myself. And now, this year I still hate myself so much I hate myself so much that I get disgusted when I have to scrub my body when I shower, I would love to be beautiful. I managed to throw away the things I was hurting myself with so I'm pretty happy with myself even though I know there are so many things I could hurt myself with. My mother doesn't know what I've done in the past and what I think of myself, I'm always afraid that she will see the marks left on my body because I don't know what she would say if she knew, I know that she also wanted to end it when she was younger but she has health problems, she is alone and my brother has cancer, so all this makes her sad deep down and I don't want to add another problem to her.
Sorry for talking a lot but I needed to, it probably won't help but I wanted to express myself because I think strangers won't judge me, goodbye and thank you for reading, I don't know you but if you have read until the end then I thank you and I appreciate what you have done for me, if you want to talk don't hesitate I will answer you, bye."
18y0h14,Depression,2024-01-04,Should be feeling great this week but im (27f) really just phoning it in.,"Just feeling… really heavy with dread the past few days. It might be the fear of a new year and hoping it’s not another bad one where I make dumb choices.

I got awarded employee of the month and I want to feel great about that. My family is so lovey and preparing to celebrate me on my birthday next week.

But all of this is making me nauseas - a new year that I don’t wanna fuck up. A year older and feeling like there’s nothing to show for it. But I keep carrying on at work and to my husband as if everything is just oh-so great in life.

I wonder why I - just can’t - express my honesty to the people who love me.

Thanks for the space to vent. 🖤"
18y04kg,Depression,2024-01-04,I have to leave the only girl I love. How to move on?,"We know each other for 10 years. I love her, sometimes she loves me too. But I am not gonna make it. (life is not a movie you know, religion, financial ability, career, family, society a lot of variables) So we are parting I guess. It makes me feel like a coward. I can call/text/meet her anytime and say anything. I wish I could say to her, ""Listen, you dont need to be sad girl anymore. I fixed my life, we are going to start a family tomorrow."" My life is not going to be fixed and I am losing her, the only girl who still cares for me and loves me and wanted me to say those words. How do I get rid of this cowardness?"
18xzz4b,Depression,2024-01-04,Messy depressing thoughts,"So I downloaded Reddit today because I wanted to connect with people and feel understood without any judgement.

I have been struggling with mental health issues since middle school (I am 20 now). Mainly social anxiety, health related anxiety, constant mood changes, and intense feelings of sadness, worthlessness, helplessness, emptiness and so much more. 

These past few days I hit an all time low and I don't know why but I've been constantly thinking about past regrets and what could be different. Yesterday I broke down in my room which I haven't done in months. I was thinking about how much I struggled ( and still do) making friends and maintaining friendships. 

I also feel very lonely and misunderstood all the time. Anyway I just wanted to vent a little. My thoughts are messy af lol."
18xzvi5,Depression,2024-01-04,I’m tired,"People always say that suicide is a permanent solution for a temporary problem but life sucks (not in the angst teenager way, well maybe a bit).

I just don’t see the point in living a life that will suck."
18xzo1v,Depression,2024-01-04,how to stop bed rotting?,"really need to stop spending all my free time in bed. i can feel myself wasting away but it’s also my safe space, so it’s been hard for me to change. any advice??"
18xzila,Depression,2024-01-04,Do my parents understand what’s going on,"
6 months ago I (20F) my mental health spiralled out of control and I ended up calling a suicide hotline where an ambulance was nearly called. 
Soon after I called my mum after some chit chat I just blurted out what happened, she instantly passed me to my dad and I hear her cry out in the background and they both ask if they should come pick me up (3hr drive) but I say no, it would make it way too real and make me feel guilty for making them drive and cancel plans, looking back I regret not taking up the offer. 

This event made us look into taking medication for my adhd, but nothing has happened as of yet

When I came home a month later nothing, no mentioned about it like it didn’t happen.

6 months later I find myself thinking do you really think that all went away on its own, shocker it hasn’t. 

I know by now I need to ask for help again but that was the biggest cry for help I have ever done, your child calls you to say they were ready to end their life and that is not enough.

I want to bring it up but I’m not ready for my life and relationships to change."
18xzi12,Depression,2024-01-04,Born to suffer,"Just needed to vent, even if nobody reads this. Lately I just been wondering what’s the point of it all. Born into this world when we didn’t ask for any of this. I was cheated on in a relationship of 8 years, it shattered my already low self esteem. Even two years on I can’t look in the mirror and not pick apart my flaws. I’m on the shorter side, not overly short but short enough to be unattractive. Terrible thin hair, ugly bone structure. I’ve been walking in public and had someone yell out their car window “you look like shit”. It happened years ago buts always stuck with me. There’s a cute girl I always see at my work, I’ve never been inappropriate or disrespectful. I try to crack jokes, bring up interesting topics to chat about but anytime I find someone attractive the feelings are not reciprocated. I can tell she doesn’t want to be bothered by me, I whiten my teeth and I’m well groomed but my smile makes me look like a creep. Her words are kind, but in her face I can see I disgust her. I’m not the man she can see herself with. I workout, try so hard to find clothes that fit properly, do all these things yet I’ve never once received a vibe that someone was interested. The last date I went on with a girl over a year ago(met her on tinder and she was the only match who responded in a 4 month window) made a direct intentional negative comment about my appearance in the middle of the date. A comment about something I’ve always been insecure about. I have no friends, I go days-weeks without any text messages or calls. I’m learning a second language, I have more money than ever before because I’m constantly working. I’m trying to hard to be the best version of myself I can be, but I’m tired. I’m lonely. I can’t help but feeling like this is all for nothing. I’m 28 now, I feel like I’ll be alone forever. Working forever. I just want to move away with someone who loves me, just her and I. Together alone in a beautiful mountain cabin or something, relaxing everyday and living a simple life away from this rat race. A pipe dream. A fairytale. I know it could never happen. What’s the point of this all? I don’t care about having the fastest car, or the biggest house. I just want to be attractive, loved and happy alone with the one person I love. This life seems meaningless and pointless aside from that one goal. That one unachievable goal. I don’t think I’ll ever kill myself, but I am never scared of dying. To just be done with all of this sounds nice. Just so tired."
18xzd92,Depression,2024-01-04,I really hate myself,"I just wish I could change everything about me. I don’t know what I would change first. I always end up sad &amp; my sadness is so prolonged. Just every little thing ends up making me feel worse, think worse, do worse. I don’t have friends, I’m not good at connecting or truly being vulnerable with “friends” which means I don’t see them as friends. I can’t tell people stuff, I’m constantly lying about my life, I’m just scared they’ll realize I do nothing, but hate myself.

I don’t like when people see my scars, than they either lecture me or look at me differently.
I can’t even talk about love, because nobody really actually loved me. I don’t even have to put thought into it, I just do things that piss people off. Last year it was just constant su1c1d@l thoughts. Everyone chooses someone else over me, and I deserve that. I just hate the constant thought of “I shouldn’t be here” “why am I here” “What’s wrong with me”
A little kid told me I looked weird &amp; ugly at the park &amp; it destroyed me. My ego is just so fucking weak.

I don’t know if it’s karma, but when I see those happily married people or happy families I get so fucking jealous. 
I want to be perfect like them. I wish I was normal enough to have a life like that. 

Apparently life is connecting with people, but I don’t know how to. I thought about becoming religious, but I stand out…I feel like I’m not accepted there. I just want to live a boring, but fulfilling life.
I’ll never know what’s wrong with me, maybe I’m just socially awkward, maybe I’ve always been insecure, I don’t know. I just know I hate living like this."
18xzcr1,Depression,2024-01-04,I'm losing my mind.,I'm just so sad... Like all of the time. And its driving me insane. I cant get anything done. The loneliness is killing me aswell but I don't want to bother anyone. Just venting I suppose. But I'm tired... I'm really tired and I just want to lay in bed forever. 
18xzbcn,Depression,2024-01-04,why are people such socially awkward as hell these days?,"I am taking a college English composition class to fulfill my requirement this quarter and wtf, during icebreaker I introduced myself and tried to chat and honestly wtf nobody really want to interact. Some people knew each other before and they chatted occasionally and others didn't give much of a fuck about me or any other, one guy just sat in the corner and kept to his phone or ipad whatever. I mean this class supposedly is not emphasised on group work or what but this kind of altitude makes me so fucking sick, like this is not the first time. Maybe because I am technically a foreigner here and my english and communication skill is not the best, and I suffered from anxiety and depression since last quarter, I am getting treated and am better than last quarter but wtf is going on, I'm not tolerating this much anymore, I would rather just take math &amp; physics class that I enjoy and except the occasional lab work I don't have to tolerate people's cold and neglecting altitude towards each other"
18xz8nv,Depression,2024-01-04,Family history of suicide. I feel like im destined to be next.,"
      Not too short, not too long, but sweet, i have noone to talk to anymore so i just need to unload. Iv been going through it as something happened new years eve and iv cried more these last three days than i did the whole of last year.

      My mom killed herself when i was 12 because my only blood sister died of heart failure. Not long after my uncle killed himself because he went blind from the same disease that i have. My favorite cousin killed herself due to unknown reasons not even a full year ago, and it just feels so right that im next.

      Everytime i get down, sad, depressed, lie alone with my thought, all i can think of is how easy it would be. How scarily easy it would be if i had a quick, simple way to end myself (i.e. gun.) I cry because i know its wrong, but it feels right. I tried to commit about 6 years ago by taking 40 muscle relaxers but that failed, and i told myself i would never again. The last two years though, its back. 

     I think about it when im sad over the small things, but when the big things happen like whats happening now, i think about pills again. I just need advice, suggestions, something. It feels right, it feels like i should to make things come full circle, but i know i shouldnt."
190lwiv,Depression,2024-01-07,"The only things I relate to are “Nine Inch Nails,” “Rusty Lake,” and the colors black and red","You don’t have to get what I mean. I just wanted to get this out. Nobody gets why I do what I do. They come up with all these shallow reasons that really don’t hit the nail on the head. But I feel so alone. So fucking alone, and I find solace in the things mentioned above, and a few “Black Mirror” episodes like “Bandersnatch”, “white bear”, “playtest”, and “demon 79.” But they just don’t understand why I do what I Do. I’ll probably delete this post later just because I’ll probably regret posting it later if I dont end myself which i will almost definitely not because im scared to die. There, i’m scared to die and my writing is shit and everyone things i’m nicer and smarter than I actually am. My family thinks im better than I am. They don’t know me actually. Nobody knows me. And I dont want to need other people’s approval of who I am to not feel like a freak but I do. Everyone does. Living, consciousness is suffering. I’m tired of all this existentialist, essentialist bullshit. Im ready for depression. Straight up depression. Depression has shaped me far beyond reason."
190lfyw,Depression,2024-01-07,i can’t stop crying,"Ever since one of my friends blocked me out of no where recently, I can’t stop feeling sad. I’m still hurt and confused, and at the same time I feel so empty. 

My closest friend is gonna be hanging out with an online friend all of this upcoming week, so I don’t want to bother him with my problems.

My brother has spent every day hanging out with his girlfriend so he’s not really available anymore.

I feel so alone and my hobbies have become boring. I’ve been going to sleep at 3am and waking up at 10am which I rarely ever do. I’m starting to feel less hungry.

I hate how much I’m affected by someone who apparently didn’t give a shit about me, since he removed me from everything mid convo.

Like seriously, each time I’m not near anyone in the house I feel incredibly sad or start crying. I even fucking relapsed and I feel so stupid."
190kwzu,Depression,2024-01-07,I have a problem.,"I only feel hapiness over the suffering of other people, i may laugh at a joke or smile at good news but that is more like an instinct than a feeling


i pretended to be happy or sad my whole life so i could feel ""normal"" but it just hasnt been working lately, i just feel off more often than before

I see myself as apathetic trash, wich is correct, but i still feel bad over feeling good on other's misery, wich is uncharacteristic or apathetic trash

190kwm9,Depression,2024-01-07,I only have “half-friends” and I’ve never felt more lonely,"I’m almost 26. College drop out. Working a job that doesn’t pay enough where I’m extremely burnt out and miserable and just tired.

I have a super small family - just my parents (who are divorced) and my brother. We are all very tight on money and I’m not close with any of them. I haven’t seen my mom or dad for a couple months (which is okay, my dad is a narcissist and my mom is an enabler even though she means well) and my brother and I are not on speaking terms due to the argument we had a little bit ago about him being a terrible father &amp; a bum who lives with our mom but does nothing to help her (she’s disabled and he’s about to turn 30 and doesn’t even help her clean or take out the trash or pay any bills. The house is filthy.)

Anyways, I also have no real friends. I moved in with the two people who I thought were my only friends about 7 months ago and it’s made me realize that they weren’t really ever my friends.

One of them got a boyfriend and when he is dating someone we just stop hanging out. Before he found his bf, we hung out probably once a week on average. After they started dating, we hung out like once a month. I felt used bc he only ever texted me to ask to take him to work or pick him up from work (he lived in the studio attached to our condo). And now he just broke his part of the lease to move an hour away to live with his boyfriend and I know that I’m just probably never gonna see him again. We’ve known each other for about 6 years now and the last time he moved far away to live with a bf, we hung out like twice in the two years he lived there.

My other ‘friend’ and remaining roommate is the type of person that I feel like I will never be close to. Hanging out with her feels more like a transaction. She’s not spontaneous, and it’s hard to describe but everything feels…. Like I’m walking on eggshells around her. I have to be careful what I say, and it feels very awkward. It’s not just two friends chilling, it feels more like two acquaintances hanging out for the second time ever, every time we hang out. She is super close with her sister snd 99% of her free time is spent with her. For example I asked her to hang out both yesterday night and today and she said she was talking to her sister about going out so it depended on what her sister said. Even if I ask to hang and it’s not concrete plans with her sister, she says “oh I need to ask my sister if we’re doing anything tonight first”. She tries to relate with my rants about my small toxic family but her divorced parents have money and she has a huge family. And she will always have her sister. I don’t have that.

Every single “friendship” I’ve ever had, I’ve felt like a placeholder friend or a spare friend. I’m drifting away from my toxic family and I don’t have any true friends. I feel depressed about the world we live in and how corrupt it is. I have no one to turn to. I’m burnt out, depressed, and just wish I had the spine to end things. I feel stuck. I have no money to do the things I want to do.

My only happiness is my two cats. I’ve had them since I was very young and they are both very old now. I don’t know how I’m going to cope when one of them passes.

I just don’t know what to do."

190ktn1,Depression,2024-01-07,My reason for living just died.,"When I rescued my pup, Wolf, 7 years ago I promised him 2 things: 1. I would never let him suffer/hurt. 2. I would NEVER ever leave him. 
I’ve struggled with major depression for most of my life (I'm now 40) But for the last several months, it's gotten REALLY bad. I’ve been struggling with ebbs and flows of apathy for life intertwined with active suicidal thoughts and plans. 
But my promise to my boy has always stayed my hand. A few months ago, I was standing outside my car in the rain as Wolf sat in the backseat with his huge head sticking out of the window. A wet combination of tears and rain poured down my face. As my sweet pup licked my cheeks I whispered to him how badly I wanted to die but reassured him his momma would never break her promise. As painful as it was to continue living, I would endure any amount of pain for him. 
But on Nov 27th, 2023 due to a combination of medical issues, I kissed my baby as he made his way to his side of the Rainbow Bridge. I now have nothing to live for, nothing to keep me from dying. All I want to do is to go be with Wolf. I know he’s waiting for me and I don’t want him to have to wait very long.
What do you do when your only reason for living dies?"
190jvh1,Depression,2024-01-07,Just need insite.,"Hello there.

I'm writing this because I don't think I'm strong enough to get through the next couple of days. I am 32 a trans woman been out fully living as a woman for a while. First thing that has me in this state of mind. Is the state of the US. the hate and  the rights that are being stripped away from trans people is not helping. The next couple of years in the US are going to be bad for the lgbtq+ community.
Recently my life has gone really bad my mother is dying she wants me to take over her adopted children i never wanted any children but out of duty I said I will take care of the for children and my disabled brother.
 The stress of that is crippling.
 plus my best friend of 10 plus years is shutting me out because she found a new man. My anxiety and depression is currently not helping with my friendship with my friend and I feel like I'm pushing her way as well. I'm a lot as a friend i warn everybody that when we first meet and start to get along with. 
 I have a ton of trauma not only for my childhood but making it through war plus discrimination and bigotry I have faced as a trans woman.
I don't know why I'm posting on here but I have a mental health appointment on the 11th I just don't know if I'll be here.

I've been there for four people who have all dealt with suicide depression and i help them get away from that outcome but now I'm alone."
190jg2m,Depression,2024-01-07,I used to be able to “do it” 7 times a day. Now I can’t even get hard,"Guys, please which me luck that I can find a job in cybersecurity. I’m so fucking sad. Nothing is working anymore"

190ja88,Depression,2024-01-07,Depression?,"To be brutally honest, I'm not broke and I consider myself privileged for having a good job that pays a six-fig salary. Yet I don't feel happy or connected to anyone. I can't even have an emotional conversation with my family. No girls or women want to date me. No one wants to talk to me at work. I don't think the boss likes me, and I might lose this job. Maybe I'm just despicable. 

People of my peers think I'm weird. People beyond my reach think I'm not qualified for their class. People that are less fortunate and less privileged think I'm pretentious. I fit in no context or environment. Maybe I'm just despicable. Maybe it's all in my head.

I send out wishes texts to my ""friends"" occasionally, and if I do not, no one sends me one. It's like I'm completely invisible. I admit that I'm an ugly guy. I always think my appearance is my biggest disadvantage, and I try to go to the gym to fix it but I can't stay on the diet for being too stressed. My sister says I look okay, though my dating records would disagree.

I'm not eloquent enough to talk my way into a date. Girls think I'm too awkward or too shy. Long ago, I once refused to have sex with a girl in bed because I respected her too much, saying that I want to get to know her better (she was kinda drunk) and the time would come when we'd happily do it together. She dumped me and later I found out that she thought I wasn't interested in her. I guess it's my fault for being a dumbass.

I'm sorry I might come off as pretentious and you might think I should be happy in my position for being financially well off. I am not. Neither rich nor happy, just a bit comfortable with my rent and living (no I can't afford a house where I live). Whenever I see a couple or a family happily go together, I feel jealous and yearn for my time when I would be like them, if that would ever happen. Maybe I'm too greedy and I should accept where I am? Maybe the chemicals in my brain are messing with me?

I try to find a hobby like reading but I just can't focus. Every time I read something I can just do about 2 pages, then I would jump onto something else. Even when I play games, I do it for like 10 minutes and exit out midgame. This isn't me when I was young. I used to devour books and play games for hours. Maybe my brain is getting old? (In my late 20s now)

I live alone for years. I just want to talk to someone. Sorry for the long post."
190ipx3,Depression,2024-01-07,A guy (m49) told me he doesn’t care about me (f29). I want to die because of this. How to manage it?,"I was seeing this guy for 4 years, start at 24 and fall in love for the first time. I told him I love him very quickly then he said I should be patient for him fo feel love. So we just did sex for 4 years.

 I freaked out, many times. I have never been such a crazy person (only by msg). I have never been very far away but it was kind of harassment I think. So he ghosted me a lot. When I was ghosted, I was trying an other relationship with someone else to try to forget (it was not working).

I was always with a big hope when we were taking again. He has always been so understanding and cute. 

Recently, he said that at the end he was more answering by pity. That he appreciate me but I’m suffering and when we start again talking I’m looking to talk to him everyday, too much, he can feel how I am in the need and anxious about it.

“He love someone else and understand me because the girl doesn’t care about him.” Yeah… he said that few days ago.


I agree. I can cry if I don’t have any answer for 2 days. 

So now, this is the end. It’s probably the best thing that could happens to me but I don’t see the point of existing whithout him.

I am feeling addicted to this relation. I never felt in this way before and I’m so lost on how to manage it. I’ve been so depressed when he was ghosting me for 3 months, like almost dying because I stop eating.

How to continue without any hope?"
190ihr6,Depression,2024-01-07,antidepressants made me dumb…,"hi,

i’ve been on antidepressants for a while (they haven’t helped) and i can’t think clearly anymore. i read sentences over and over again and still can’t comprehend the meaning. my memory is awful… i have no recollection of yesterday, and i seem to be in a constant state of brain fog.

i have mixed feelings about iq tests, but anyways… i’ve taken several standardized iq tests over my lifetime and after starting antidepressants my iq score dropped significantly in the processing speed area.

i really hope this can be reversed, and i plan to gradually get off the antidepressants. it feels like my brain is deteriorating, and it’s so frustrating.

190ifuv,Depression,2024-01-07,Well f*k me.,"My own parents threaten me to put me on street if I try or hurt anyone or sometimes its in self defense. They do  want to get rid of me so badly. They dont have any more tolerance to my suicide attempts anymore and think I was faking it. I dont fake it, I have proof of scars and injuries that I have on my body and they aren't pretty to look at. I was brought back to life when I was so close to over dose and dying on pills or alchohol. Now im a mess at age of 30. I blame myself everyday for being alive and still going with my life and felt horrible that I scared my poor cat for my anger outburst at people who's living with me. She didn't understand what is going on but she didn't get hurt by me. I never EVER hurt my babies...!! Its so wrong to hurt any animals during anger outburst. 

I hate how my life is now still stuck in the mud and can't get out of it. I tried everything to get my life back on track but instead I get bad lucks and horrible things. Im now thinking maybe im at fault for being alive... I just still want to die but can't do it right because im just pathetic person who can't do anything good in life... I will delete this post after an hour or so... dont worry im safe right now. Im  just venting this to help cope with things right after I got home from hospital stays.

190esww,Depression,2024-01-07,I really want to die but I can’t put my parents through the grief of losing me. I feel so trapped.,"I’ve been suffering from severe depression for almost 20 years now. I’m also disabled and chronically ill. I just really want to call it quits. I can’t handle being alive anymore when I know that my situation isn’t going to get any better. I’ve tried everything I can think of to try to improve my mental health but nothing has worked. This isn’t a ‘temporary problem’, it’s permanent. And don’t try to turn it around on me and say “Death is permanent too!” I know that. But I can’t take being alive anymore. I’m in so much physical and emotional pain and I want out.

The only reason why I haven’t made a serious suicide attempt is because I know firsthand how my parents will react. My mom’s best friend committed suicide a few years ago and I’ve never seen her that upset before in my life. She was inconsolable. Watching her go through the grieving process was so fucking difficult to watch because she was in so much pain. I can’t even imagine how much worse the pain would be for them when they lose their own daughter. 

I’m staying alive for my parents. As soon as they’re gone, I’ll finally be able to end my life."
190epp2,Depression,2024-01-07,I’m getting quite scared about how strong the urge is to just end it.,"I feel absolutely no hope for the future, the only thing keeping me going is seeing my nieces growing but even that feels me with fear because I worry about their well-being and the world they’re growing up in. I don’t want to do it anymore. 

I believe I have abandonment issues and attachment issues and something has peaked that recently with seeing an ex I thought had changed. If someone can not give a fuck about my feelings so easily and be so selfish, it makes me feel what’s the point in even having feelings for people and trying to find someone. That being said it’s not the be all and end all, as I have serious other concerns and worries about my health and the fact I’m unemployed.

It’s just when I’m alone and with my thoughts and feelings, I really want to end it. It feels like it would bring me comfort and I could die and wait for my aunty who is now in palliative care. I could also see my nan and my surrogate grandad. That is if there even is an afterlife. I don’t think therapy is going to help much as this feeling feels so deep set within me now. I really don’t see a point in anything. I’m 33, I have no job, I’ve ruined my life for a girl who’s a cunt that doesn’t give a fuck about anyone but herself, I have herpes caught from said girl, I have social anxiety issues and I still live at home. 

I’m not even feeling sorry for myself, I haven’t helped myself when I should have done, it’s just the last three years has been nothing but downhill. Now I’m genuinely scared where my mind is at, I feel like I’m going to end it eventually."

190bbob,Depression,2024-01-06,In a forest right now,"My plan is to get drunk and then go through with it. Hopefully I don't fuck this up. I just wanna post this as a final vent. Life is such bullshit. It's so fucking unnecessary. Why do people think that there is a point to it all? I just don't get it. Like yeah, you can pretend that there is a meaning or ""find your meaning"" as people would say, but that still just completely subjective. I didn't even ask to be here in the first place, and I'm supposed to be thankful to my parents for wanting kids for their selfish reasons? Fuck all of this honestly. I'm sick of the monotony of life. Humanity can go fuck itself."
1909g62,Depression,2024-01-06,Things that have helped me:,"Hey y'all, hope you're all doing well

I have dealt with depression and loneliness for a very long time and I thought it might be a good idea to share what helped me.

1. **Step Outside:** I know this is obvious, but spending time outside is so crucial. Take a short walk or explore your local area. The nature and fresh air can work wonders. Remember to stay safe
2. **Let the light in:** Many who suffer from depression find comfort in the dark. However, opening your curtains or blinds and letting in natural light can have a significant impact on your mood. Light is essential for our brains, and a lack of it can exacerbate feelings of loneliness.
3. **Establish Routine:** Creating a routine, even starting with small, achievable tasks, has been my most effective method. It provides a sense of structure and purpose. Begin with simple things like: Drinking water when you wake up, Cleaning clothes off the floor, Taking dirty dishes to the sink. Start small and find your flow.

Remember, the first step is the hardest and you are not alone in this journey. Feel free to share your methods and experiences.

and have an **amazing** day :) ❤️

18zzxd0,Depression,2024-01-06,I just want to die,"Everyday's the same. I wake up at 2pm in my depressing apartment. I just sit on my couch and cry all day. Sometimes I hurt myself too but I don't really have energy for that anymore either. I try to go to sleep at 11pm but I'm so restless I keep on crying til it's 5am or so. I usually cry myself to sleep. My eyes are so swollen. 
I'm quite a social person so I need human contact pretty often. Sometimes a friend visits but it's never enough. I just hate being alone with my thoughts. I have some friends but I fear I'll lose them all eventually. I don't really have the skills to make new friends if that happens. I think I'm not a very likeable person honestly. 
I have a dog which is at my parents' house atm. I miss him dearly but I can't go there + I don't think it's morally right to take him here. It's not his job to suffer here with me. 
I've been depressed almost all my life. I used to have some hopes and dreams when I was younger but now all I think of is death. I feel like a total failure. My family's so ashamed of me. I shouldn't exist. 
I also cannot get therapy because I'm ''too sick for that''. 
I'm only 21. I feel like a broken adult or a child who grew up too fast. I'm so lost. I'd love to have an adult to talk to. That would be amazing if I could be honest about my feelings with my parents but their solution to my problems is to simply get a job so that's not an option. 
I feel so unheard since my country wouldn't even help me.
I know my problems are mostly kinda dumb and worthless but the depression is real and it's getting unbearable. I cringe at myself so much when I'm trying to type this all out.
I tried to commit suicide a month ago but I clearly didn't succeed. Made me feel even more worthless because I can't even take my own life. Like jesus. 
There's nothing for me to live for. I'm a burden to everyone but I still can't even end my life. 
I wish I'd suddenly die from a natural cause or there would be an accident or something. 
I keep reading all of your stories here and I feel you all. Wish I could help"

18zuavw,Depression,2024-01-06,When the symptoms of your depression is triggered how does your body feel?,"I spoke to my psychiatrist over telemedicine and I cried. I’ve never cried in front of her of all our 5 years of knowing each other. I could tell she was really scared.

I said I feel cold.

How does your body feel when you are very upset?"
18zu9rf,Depression,2024-01-06,Sexual frustration is driving me towards suicide,"I'm 32 years old. Male. Straight. I have never had a girlfriend. Or sex. Or a date. Or a kiss. No joke. I have ZERO experience regarding dating. With 32 years on me! And I do want a girlfriend, or at least intimacy. I fear is completely late for me, though. That I'm completely late in the dating game. Women my age usually are single (or married) moms. I'm not interested in single mothers. I don't have the emotional maturity to deal with a family. I myself don't want to have children.
I suffer from Asperger Syndrome, which partially explains my very anti social behavior. I have no friends. Just family and co-workers. It's very difficult for me to interact with others. It stresses and exhausts me. I have a very hard time establishing any kind of affectionate links with people.
I have a very low self esteem, no confidence in myself, and a general dislike for life. I'm not happy. I've been taking anti depressant pills and going to therapy after therapy for years now. Most of my depression and suicidal thoughts stems from my sexual frustration. I have a deep-seated fear of what women might do to me: reject me, cheat on me, leave me, use me, falsely accuse me of abuse, etc. Since I nowadays lack friends, I don’t go out. Since I don't go out, I never meet any women. Meeting women the normal way is very complicated for me.
I tried Tinder, thrice. A few matches, but it didn’t work. It didn't lead to anything besides friendly chats.
In my desperation I tried to force the matter twice: I hired escorts. Didn’t work. I was so anxious and nervous about the fact I was going to do something completely new, with a complete stranger I knew nothing about, in a completely random place, etc. that as a result I couldn't get an erection, so nothing happened. I refuse to take viagra since I know very well everything works great at the biological level. My issue is psychological, not physical.
Is there someone (or do you know someone?) going through the same or similar hell? Did he/she get past that? How? And at what age and cost?"
18zseuc,Depression,2024-01-06,I'm not enough and i'm almost done,"All of my friends have girlfriends, I obviously don't. I wouldnt say that I am the most or least attractive in my friend group but i am definately the lonliest. I have had a gf before but she was honestly moving way to fast for me despite me asking her otherwise. I.e she asked me to father her kids and marry her after two weeks of dating (I'm 16). I'm really lonely and I feel like nobody really knows me (not even family) so I don't know if I actually want a girlfriend or if I want someone that I can be honest to and someone who knows me, not the fake me that everyone knows. I feel so isolated and left behind, but what if it should be this way? I'm not good enough for the girl that i have a crush on. nowhere near good enough. Maybe I'm not good enough for anyone. but I still like her, she's funny and really smart. I hate myself."

This past month has been very confusing because I have stopped enjoying almost everything, I have started feeling this numb empty feeling inside me, even though I at times feel happy or entertained, this hopelessness feeling has been knawing at me, I have started feeling like i hate everything, i don't want to live but i am nowhere near s01c1dal, i don't wish to die,  i find s01c1de as a very serious topic, I need to clarify i am far from it. I just don't see a point in anything anymore. I hate myself and I hate my life even though everything is perfect, I have a loving family, friends, and generally don't have a stressful life, except for some past traumatic events that I am almost over, and my ADHD that I have just started medicating, I have a great life so why am I like this? I feel ungrateful."
18zo01g,Depression,2024-01-06,There is no inner beauty in me,"I've been depressed to a depth I've never felt before.

Around the middle of December, a week and a half before Christmas, the most promising relationship I've ever been in ended. I wasted my time developing strong feelings for someone emotionally unavailable.

I went to my dad's house for Christmas, and being in my hometown with my dad reminded me every waking hour of my parents' failed marriage, my dad's choice in a wife, and how that all affected me well into my adult life.

I got back into town and found the girl who left me is dating a new guy. She wasn't emotionally unavailable - she was just emotionally unavailable for *me*.

On New Year's Eve, I went to a friend's party. I was the only guy who none of the women there even wanted to have a conversation with, let alone dance with. I also overheard talk that a good portion of my friends are moving away after their current lease cycles end in July.

I later learned that I'm not actually as well-liked as I thought I was. I was explicitly asked not to come over to a friend's house today, and when I asked another friend who *was* invited if they think I'm annoying (a suspicion I've had for months now), he confirmed that yes, they do find me annoying. This blindsided me because we had spent so much time together and see each other so regularly, I really thought I was liked and welcomed.

AND I'm about to turn 30 in a week, which comes with its own set of feelings that tie into all of the above.

Now I'm thinking about where I went wrong. My constant inner struggle for meaning, acceptance, and purpose in life left me completely unrelatable to society at large. Nothing about my personality, identity, or lifestyle makes sense. At best, I'm a walking curio, no different from a circus freak. At worst, I'm an alien who has no place on this earth and no reason to be amongst human beings."
18zhakz,Depression,2024-01-05,I'm not depressed. I can't be. I just can't sleep and i cry all night every night. It's not good.,"I do not know what's happening to me. My life is okay. Nothing that can make me unhappy. Yet I've been crying at nights. And so much crying. Ugly crying.

I noticed myself wanting to be left alone. I hate being alone but i also hate company of any sort. I don't know what's wrong. It cannot be as serious as depression...but this isn't normal. I need help.. I do remember the last time i was truly happy. And man it was 4 months ago. 

I just realised that i haven't felt happiness in 4 months. Everything is just a distraction from the emptiness i have within me. I don't know. I'll go to sleep now. Cried too much today. My cheeks are burning."
18ze5zo,Depression,2024-01-05,Trying to stay for my toddler,"I cant go on anymore and I've come up with a plan to kill myself. The only thing is that I have a 2 year old daughter, and I keep telling myself that she'd be okay, I know it would be hard for her at first but maybe she'd be okay in the long run? My ex (her dad) has family members who would be amazing at looking after her (my ex is in the military so he can't look after her full time). I know it's selfish but I've felt like this my whole life and tried to battle it but I just feel that I've reached the end and that as much as I love her more than anything I can't feel deal with the pain of life anymore"

18zawu5,Depression,2024-01-05,Am I the problem?,"I’m a 19M I’ve been sad for a while now and don’t get me wrong I’ve gone through my fair share of fucked up things but I can’t help but feel like it’s my fault I’m sad. Like my mindset, the way I see things. I have a fine life I have a roof and a car and friends and a loving girlfriend but yet everyday I wake up sad. Everyday I wake up and think why. I can’t move on from my past and I’m too afraid of the future to actually do anything about it. I’m weak and I put others before myself because I feel like I don’t deserve to be loved. So many people like and love me. I’m kind I’m caring I do what’s right but I still hate myself and my life. I’ve come to the conclusion that it’s my fault I’m depressed and I don’t even know if I want to get better. I hate the world and the way that it works. The way that you can work your whole life and still be virtually nothing. Is it worth it to keep going or am I just prolonging my inevitable sadness. I’ve always believed that I’ll never get better but maybe that’s exactly why I can’t. I used to think I was all alone and that made me even sadder but now I realize that neither my emotions nor my problems are unique. Now I see that we’re all the same. This should make me feel better but to me it only makes it worse. It makes me feel even more insignificant. The bottom line is I’m miserable and suffering. I’m barely surviving let alone living. If I died tomorrow the world would still rotate, the sun would rise and set. Nothing would change. I think that’s what I fear the most. It’s not the fact that I feel insignificant it’s the fact that I am."
18z6q4o,Depression,2024-01-05,I’m overwhelmingly depressed and quite honestly reaching the end of my rope.,"I’m going out on a limb here cause I don’t know what this will do to solve anything. I got out of a 5 year relationship last October. It was a tumultuous relationship and the break up even more so. We got kicked from our Apartment because she refused to help with rent, blamed me for it and was told by a mutual friend I was trying to sleep with her. We reconciled and lived separately all the while I’m pretty sure she was actively cheating on. The then ex mutual friend proceeded to call the cops on me during a conflict between me and the gf after I didn’t leave the car we had for the last 2 years(it was in her name). Went to jail, got out she hit me up saying she still loved me. Proceeded to dump me 
5 days before our anniversary and went to a party with ex friend “serving c*nt” and blocked me on everything. Reached out on Christmas so that she could see my son who had called her his step mom since he was 1 she brings another dude with her and conflict arises. Obviously. And she blamed me for it.
So a week and a half later, I can’t stop feeling so fucking depressed and alone. Like I wasted my time and like I’m a piece of shit because I’ve got no one. I alienated all my friends for this relationship and it blew up in my face and the people that are still around are just ignorant. I love very hard. I learned that when I was young. I don’t have all the tools to deal with my emotions and I have a family history of them being heavy. I feel like Sisyphus, pushing this boulder up hill only for it to keep falling back down. I’ve had the just general misfortune of always feeling or being the odd man out and for a while I didn’t feel that way. Now it’s all I feel. It’s overwhelming and I don’t really feel like anyone gives a shit. Like I’m drowning at a beach and everyone just stares. Atp, I want to not be here anymore or do anything for anyone. This feels like it’s not the place for me and I’m trying have a more better disposition but again. Sisyphus and the boulder."
18ywmq3,Depression,2024-01-05,"I think I'm depressed, but not in the way that I used to be","Hi everyone, sorry if this comes off as more of a rant than anything but I just need to get this all off my chest. Basically, as the title implies, I've struggle with bouts of depression for the last eight or so years. Granted, it's been nowhere near constant - in fact, there was a brief period where I would say it went away entirely - but I feel like its gradually coming back.

What strikes me as odd however, is that this is not thr type of depression I have dealt with in th past, in fact - it's almost the polar opposite. In my previous bouts of depression I was easily aggravated, prone to crying, and desperate for the validation of other people and stuck with a lingering sense that I'd never be good enough for anyone to want in their life. Now however, it has seemingly manifested as not wanting to be around anybody for the most part, a pretty noticeable lack of visible emotion and a complete depletion of my sex drive - completely different to my adolescence where I was desperate to lose my virginity to prove I could be worth something to someone (although, I'll attribute that in part to teenage hormones as well).

Whilst these are all pretty by-the-by symptoms of depression, what I find odd is that I don't necessarily feel sad, or aggravated or hopeless - in fact, I stick very much to a routine and enjoy doing certain stuff, I can get up and go to work or university without hassle but deep down, theres just a lingering feeling that I'd rather be left to my own devices and not have to speak to anyone. Theres also been a noticeable uptake in my drinking (nothing of concern for the most part, just usually at the local bar after work some nights) and it again, isn't a mechanism to mask anything, but it just makes me feel calm.

Again, sorry if this was kinda a nothing post but I'm just wondering, has anyone dealt with such a significant change in symptoms before? Or even similar symptoms?"
18ywkmw,Depression,2024-01-05,Struggling with mental health for a long time,"This is a long history, currently I’m 30(M) from EU country and I’ll finish my degree (BBA) next year.

I have struggling with anxiety and depression since high school (bullying for being gay mostly) since then but I have breaks (some years I was okay thats why I wanted to start a degree to get my goals) and now I’m quite depressed and with a lot of anxiety. Bullying destroyed my self-steem.

Even If I finish my degree I won’t land my target job (working for a FAANG or another tech company), non-target college, average grades, no experience (I have to aim to internship or junior positions) and thats my feeling in my entire life never is enough and/or mistakes were made and I can’t change it.

All my friends living their best lives (finishing PhD, getting married, meeting new people, hell even those that bully me they seem successful with their family and business). Basically the best you can do in your 20’s but I literally I did nothing. Even I think I had to do a different degree because corporate world is more structured (to start working at a large bank or at Google than say as nurse or physician) and I might not “fit” there even if is my professional dream.

Thats why even I have thinking a lot lately on suicide comes to my mind a lot because I won’t recover my years lost (my 20s), my professional career might never take off to start thats why I think a lot on suicide because I think there are little room to my goals even If I fix things from the past, those times never will return again. Or on how much impact had this on my self-steem I can’t have healthy relationships with another men :( I had my last boyfriend does 10 years old and I feel better alone.

I needed to write this somewhere because I love my family but mental health is not a thing in my family (is more of a taboo for them / hard to understand).

I agree that I’m bad and my last 4 years of endless educational and professional development led to me being completely alone.

I’m bad, ok.

18xyowr,Depression,2024-01-04,Debby Downer,"I’m so f*cking angry that my life is the way it is. I am either acting out because I’m upset, or I’m upset because I’ve been acting out. I think life has always been so, so for everybody. For most of us. I remember even prior to acting out, I felt like life was filled with a pretty darn near equal amount of negative and positive. I think that’s just sh*t. There’s no point in living if the bad cancels out the good. So I started trying to enjoy my life with drugs and alcohol. But even then, I see all kinds of people out there who are drinking daily, or smoking weed daily, and they’re not even close to being as depressed as me. I see other people laugh, not me. I think most people would eventually kill themselves living alone. I see other people in relationships, not me. I see other people with friends, not me. What I’m trying to say is that it feels like drugs and alcohol aren’t the issue here, because currently people that I refer to drink and smoke weed daily. My 1 friend (I lied, I actually have 1 friend) does all kinds of dabbling and so do his whole friend group. They all have relationships. I remember when I was in around 9th grade, I started to see my friends, who were also big pot smokers and drinkers, well I would see my friends making relationships. I think right now it’s been so long since I was in 9th grade, I’ve started to convince myself that I missed my shot at getting a relationship because I got into drugs. No… I remember all of us (my 9th grade friends and I) dabbling around, yet I’m the only one who didn’t thrive relationship wise. The fact that I was one of few who didn’t put themselves out there means one of two things, I’m a loser in spirit, or it’s a mental chemical thing that’s making me a loser. Either of those reasons piss me off. Cause if it’s a chemical thing, sh*t, life’s pointless… give me a pill. If it’s a spiritual thing… I’ll never go to church."

For some context i am 17 years old and ive struggled with suicidal thoughts since i was about 14. Multiple years of not speaking out to people and refusing to engage with therapists culminated in a failed (obvs lol) suicide attempt when i was 16 . Following on from that i have gone to therapy and found new interets and made new friends and obviously theyres ups and downs but right now i havent felt hopeless in months.

18xylmf,Depression,2024-01-04,Generally Struggling,"Hi guys,
I just need to vent, as I feel slightly embarrassed talking about this stuff with people I know.
About two years ago, I had to start living by myself due to a career change to teaching in a behavioural school. My life has declined since then. Moving town meant I lost contact with some of my closest friends, living alone has decimated me financially to the point that I had to start off taking a few loans out which the playbacks are still tough to pay back to this day.
Emotionally, I feel like I have reclused. My life is literally work and home, and I feel like the runt of my friendship group. Most of my friends are older than me and have either settled down with a family, got strong relationships, or seem to look down on me due to their higher earning jobs.
Physically, I hate myself. I have a chipped tooth from an epileptic seizure that I can't afford to fix. I'm balding and have grey hair at 29 and am constantly teased at work by kids and colleagues that I look closer to mid 40s. Slightly overweight too, I look pregnant. I hate it all, yet mentally cannot bring myself to actually deal with it.
I'm really struggling to try and keep everything under control. I can't sleep due to anxiety about my physical state, lack of relationships (single for 3 years), financial state and work worries (not relevant for the post).
I don't know where to start. I have a plan for the finances, and all should be sorted by June which is fine. But emotionally, physically and loneliness issues are the biggest struggle and I don't know how to handle them. Any advice at all?

TL/DR: I'm sad, lonely and feeling crappy, what do I do?"

18xyhjg,Depression,2024-01-04,positivity...,"I've been in a really dark place today. While breaking down, I heard one of my cats meow at the door. After finally calming down slightly, I checked and saw that he left a little toy mouse there.

I know it's absolutely silly and he likely just wanted to play, but it feels like he left a little gift for me to feel better. And I cried a lot. This is the cat that cuddles with me to sleep each night...

I feel awful when I think of leaving people and pets that really care about me behind, no matter how few they are. I had felt better for months, anyway.. I'm hoping I can find a semblance of that again today."
18xycz7,Depression,2024-01-03,It's the little things that still hurt,"My brother khs a few weeks ago. His service was this past weekend. At the end of the service, I just got up and left.  I was told what the plan was the night before. His best friend since kindergarten was going to take his ashes and drive him to the reception in his classic car.  I didn't want to see that.  I didn't want to see him drive off again. He left home when I was a kid. Just packed his shit and drove off in the middle of the night.  This felt the same.

And then today, I ran into my dad while I was at work. He asked me if I had seen the video that my brother's friend (same one) had sent to the group chat. ""No. I'm not a part of that"".  I never felt like my brother wanted me in his life. So, I stayed out of his. I tried reconnecting several times. But, he never did anything to stay connected.  And, the night before his service, his friend was talking about some things that he was texting on a group chat with his ex and some coworkers.  And then the video thing happened. . . .I didn't know anything about this group thing and it hurts again to feel left out. No one thought to include his little brother?!

But, then again. I've felt left out of a lot of things in my life. Including family affairs (medical issues where my parents had to go to the hospital and no one told me)."
18xy8zs,Depression,2024-01-03,I can’t feel/losing myself,"It's sad how I can't be my core self. I lose my self in my

anxiety and depression. What really hurts and gives no

hope is me not being able to feel. I want to have a gf. I

want to be able to do shit I really like. But I can't

because I can't feel. I really need help on. I want to feel

so bad. What are things I can take, or do?"
18xy8hr,Depression,2024-01-03,Incapable of productivity,"Just wondering if anyone else finds it impossible to be productive? Like everyday I wake up and it’s so hard to get out bed and get up even when I do for work I do the bare minimum and then I’m pulled back into my bed like a force of gravity, when I don’t have work I will just stay in bed all day and feel so incredibly guiltily, it’s so hard to do anything else, even self care things I should enjoy are impossible, even on the best of weeks I have at least one of two days where I will stay in bed all day.

I wonder if this is a depression thing or something else? What do other people do on their days off? Do they get up and get dressed and do hobbies and things, it honestly seems so foreign.

I guess I was hoping someone could relate I feel such immense guilt about this and no one in my life can relate to this it just makes me feel so incredibly lazy which maybe I just am."
18xy2rx,Depression,2024-01-03,Depression has cured my social anxiety,"It's funny, I used to feel so much dread and anxiety everyday going to work/school. Always trying to be nice to try to fit in and feel accepted, but I never did.

Often got picked last at gym glass, got made fun of by teachers and other classmates. Barely had any friends during that time. Got bullied and psychologically abused by girls in high-school because they knew how pathetic and desperate I was for love and attention.

Was never really a bright kid but somehow managed to get my bachelors degree even though most people in my class were 3 years younger than me. 

My whole life up until now has been utterly traumatic and shameful I never had any success with sports, carreer or romance.

Being unattractive just hurts when you are surrounded by attractive people every day.

For 3 years I tried my hardest to work a job in IT (which I originally studied for) but I ended up basically getting bullied away from my position and eventually fired because I had severe imposter syndrome and no confidence.

Currently at 27 my life feels like a total failure, I started doing basic logistics work because I don't even want to pursue my career anymore (which I studied 6 years for). 

I feel like I've reached my lowest point in life, like I can't even feel shit anymore. I think I also might of broke my own ego because I reached places of personal dissapointment I didn't even think were possible. However what I realized is that once you reach rock-bottom with your emotions its like it can't get any worse.

Somehow depression does give you a kind of superpower, ever since then I'm just unable to feel any kind of anxiety/shame/pain or whatsoever.

Feelings of anxiousness have completely left my body. Simply because if you have lost every bit of sensation that you once had, you have nothing to lose as well as nothing to fear.

I currently have no expectations / aspirations for the future but I'm done spending the rest of my life in a office.

I do think this world is still beautiful, therefore I'm currently just saving up some money to go travel and we'll see where that road takes me."
18xxysz,Depression,2024-01-03,How do you deal with inadequacy?,"I've always pretty much had self-esteem issues my whole life and it's getting to a point were I am wearing it outwards at work. I'm pretty much worthless skill wise and feel incapable of even learning the most basic things. If you told me to make coffee from a coffee maker I'd freeze and not know what to do. I've stopped applying for jobs because I doubt I'll get the position. Like I have zero confidence in myself at all. I know I shouldn't compare myself to others but I really feel like I am pathetic and honestly I look like shit and I'm getting okay with it because I just don't care anymore. I'm considering seeing a counselor but I'm very skeptical and don't really trust anyone really.  I just feel like everything's a business/money oriented and most people care about themselves. I've had health issues my whole life and it's gotten worse and at this point I'm kind of giving up. Never had a friend or dated and am mainly a loner. Parents are religious and they tell me to pray all the time, but I feel that ship sailed when I was 13. For those who were here before.. what helped you get out? I don't want to just be miserable my while life or else I'll just end it myself."

18xxu91,Depression,2024-01-03,I may commit suicide without having a reason.,"I'm 21, been depressed and suicidal a few years. It's getting worse. I've lost almost all my friends, gone from being a star student to dropping out the final year of high school and I can't hold down a job.

The problem is that my life on paper is practically perfect. I have a loving family, no issues with poverty and used to have a good social life. I had hobbies, aspirations, dreams and the resolve to work for them.

Idk what happened. My happiness just phased away. It became harder and harder to go out. The feeling of everything being pointless grew as my motivation and intrigue for life dissipated.

This past year I've mostly spent in my bed. Too tired to even watch TV. Most of the time I just lay here. Waiting for nothing. 

The doctors just gave me some antidepressants, hasn't been helping. I was also told I might have Me-fatigue but no following up even when I asked. 

My psychiatrist asked me why I was depressed. I answered honestly, I do not know. He said I can't be helped if I can't be honest. 

I don't understand. I don't know what to do. I can't go on like this. If you have any advice or information that could be of use, please help."
18xxu8j,Depression,2024-01-03,I never feel happy but hardly sad,Everyday I don’t really feel happy nor do I feel sad I have moments but my basic default setting is just nothing I don’t really want to do anything I’m 17 I vape I smoke weed I used to do other drugs but haven’t in about 3 months but tbh I was happier even when I was doing drugs like even when I was sober back then I don’t get why it’s just so shit now
18xxtqj,Depression,2024-01-03,Is it all really worth it.,"Recently joined university (21M) and met someone amazing (20F). Clicked at first contact. Being autistic, adhd, and bipolar for me this is rare. We were inseparable for the first few months of us going to uni.

 Progressed as friends and eventually started relaxing together in the student hub after classes watching movies, YouTube videos and became so comfortable around eachother she would often lay on me and be accepting of me, my scars and my body. 

Fast forward a little more when things are getting a little more serious. We both have admitted to having certain feelings but then disclosed she has a boyfriend and they’re planning on getting engaged. I can’t help but turn my feelings of and it’s leading me down my self destructive spiral and I can’t help it. I’ve started cutting, starving, and burning myself again with next to no exit in sight.

Is life really all that worth it. Is it all really worth this much torment because of my conditions. I thought I finally found someone who I could confide in but now with this new information I want to still be with them but physically can’t bring myself to talk to her about any of it."
18xxp4b,Depression,2024-01-03,I hate that people are guilting me into staying alive when I have wanted death for most of my life.,"Let me start by saying that I don't subscribe to the common beliefs most hold about death. It's not scary or all that sad to me (unless someone is killed violently against their will), and suicide seems like such a mercy to me. I *want* the cessation of all thought and sensation. I *want* to know if there's anything beyond this fucked realm of existence. But anytime I try to articulate these feelings to those I care about (and even professionals), I just get this dead-eyed stare and the greeting-card platitudes that most people get from others who don't understand them. It makes me feel angry, like the living are part of some kind of cult whose purpose is to force people to suffer. I want mercy. I want my fucking death. If the ones who say they love me *actually* loved me, they would let me die and not make such a big deal about it. My parents have other children they can project their hopes and dreams on. My friend(s) are all navigating their own adult lives, and most of them are thriving (which fills me with despair. I shouldn't hate that people around me are doing well, but I do. I'm only human, unfortunately). I want my death. I want my peace. I'm running out of reasons to defer."
18xxmz8,Depression,2024-01-03,Constant irritation,"Do many other people struggling with depression find that they are constantly irritated by everything around them? 

I’ve always somewhat been that person, have also struggled with depression since I can remember, but right now everything agitates me. Being around my nieces and nephew who I adore, is starting to become an issue as I loose patience even with them. I also work with preschoolers and find I am having less patience. Even having lunch with my mother and grand mother can cause me to take a benzo just so I can get through it. 

I am on amitryptaline and Lexapro which seemed to help a bit. Definitely makes me less teary (and less excited). But right now I feel like I’m on an endless cycle of PMS. I don’t know how to make things NOT annoy me?

I don’t know if this makes sense or if anyone knows of any way to help this but thought I’d have a ramble and put it out there."

18xx7wj,Depression,2024-01-03,I feel like I need to die.,"Hey guys, first time posting here. In earlier years I had the lingering desire to commit suicide but found various ways to understand that life isn't about feeling good all the time. I began to slowly enjoy the journey and dealt with the bumps in the road as they came. 

However, throughout this period it always felt like there was this dark shadow looming behind me just over my shoulder. I wouldn't exactly call it depression. It almost felt like this being or some kind of entity kind of signifying the inevitable. Like it's just saying ""we both know how this ends"" without actually saying anything. It doesn't feel like there's no point to anything or that my efforts are going to waste. It just feels like it'll still end in ""that"" way... As if it's not something I have a choice in. I just simply have to do it or something else will. Now I'm having thoughts of slowly distancing myself from everyone because I know that hurts alot less than if I disappear from their lives by death. Especially suicide. 

I'm growing tired of this thing behind my left shoulder, in the darkest corner of my room. Help?"

We don't have this concept here like you in USA but I am what you people would consider an inkel. Having had sjitty experiences in the past I got a lot of hatred towards myself and others around me. Recently got into a ship with this 28 year old who finally gave me a chance out of desperation of something else. I cannot be with her I never had anyone before and I cannot ever have someone. I have a bad self image that jo matter how much therapy I do it's always coming back this mentality , no matter how much gym and pills and telling myself I will be happy with her won't undo years of porn damage and recently alcohol. I will never see a woman in the same light I did 4 years ago. I know people hate incels but I kinda hate myself too , lol killing myself will save me from a life of loneliness because I know I will never be happy next to someone knowing I missed out on so many things. No way.  I cannot be with her because I cannot allow (fool) myself to trust her ,be with her. Fuck I am so frustrated and angry. As a message before sleep"

18xwr39,Depression,2024-01-03,I have to find someone to love me in 2024,"I have been single 8 years and this year it’s important that I try to find love. I can no longer be alone and watch my own back. I miss how it felt to be loved, kissed, thought about, worried about, missed,taken care of, complimented and showed off. I am beyond tired of being treated like shit by everyone around me. I know a lot of people feel and  say the same thing but I am genuinely living it every single day. People see as and easy lick period. I used to believe in humanity and that people were innately good, but even my own family showed me that’s a child way of thinking. I used to believe the black community could be helped or saved but they will drown you and snuff out ur light quicker and earlier than anyone else! I never met my father a day in my life, shocking right?? It’s the norm in my community, abandon and beat down your kids. 
It’s exhausting trying to succeed when ur alone, no one is there to celebrate, no one to go on trips with, no kids to miss me. It’s exhausting being alive alone. I can’t name the amount of people I helped out and the amount of times they gave me their ass to kiss. I am embarrassed and I feel stupid. I’m so quick to offer help but people are quicker to remind me they aren’t obligated to return the favor. This has caused me serious trust issues in relationships and everyday life. I’m always thinking someone is staring at me, talking about me, plotting on me. I’m super suspicious of people taking my things when they come to my house. Like literally hiding my own things. I haven’t been able to allow myself to date because I’m so damn angry and the worst part one one gives a shit. People will cut you deep then wash the blood right off their hands and forget. After rereading all this I prolly don’t need a lover, I need therapist lol"

I’ve been in college at my hometown for the past 2 years but it’s not working out and now my fam is making me move to a place that’s an ocean away from home. I’m talking about me having to transfer to a different college and then trying to get a job there. 

The problem is that I’m completely terrified of doing that. I’m so scared, my hands feel numb and I haven’t been able to eat or sleep properly the past months. I don’t want to live in a completely different place. I don’t want to deal with people. I don’t want to start over again. I’m exhausted of it. I’m afraid that I’d be spending so much money moving far away and then finding myself failing again. 

Even if moving might give me a bit more opportunity, I honestly don’t want it and it’s making me sick that I will have to move away.

18xw2dc,Depression,2024-01-03,any chance I can help my friend who has thought of unaliving themselves consider therapy?,"yo so I got a depressed af friend who had thoughts of deleting himself (rather not say outright) around christmas day and I'm super worried and he wont even consider therapy

I think its because previously in highschool he had therapy that sounded awful, to deal with his anger issues apparantly all they asked him to do was squeeze an ice cube?????

he has bad social anxiety and has been trying to connect with people he works with but he's had nothing so far, I've suggested that he needs to maybe pick up a hobby or go somewhere like a gaming cafe where he can meet more like minded people but he seems too anxious about it to actually do something like that? I've suggested that I go with him to one of these places but we haven't gotten round to it, hes pretty far away and his work is pretty stacked rn in terms of shifts so it has yet to happen

he has the money now so the only thing I can think to suggest is therapy, but he doesn't see the point in it considering past efforts with it.

he has convinced himself that his problems are unsolvable, because he was heavily abused as a kid and he's been trying to substantially connect with ppl at his work for years, but to no avail.

He thinks he's too smart for therapy? which I kinda get, he is extremely self aware of where his problems come from and how he could deal with them, and he works in a job that does require a lot of intelligence, but I think he needs someone who can properly reframe his issues in a way that helps him to take action? which is something I cant do."

That being said; work, bills, and paying for the necessities are all I can afford. Rent costs are astronomical, companies do not want to pay much of a livable wage and I feel that I’m in this endless cycle of living check to check. 
I’m losing patience for myself, I’m losing patience for the economy and I’m losing patience with work. 
I cant do this anymore, I want to get out of Texas so bad but can’t afford to even save money to do so.
 The idea of owning a house in any foreseeable future is non-existent, the idea of being able to afford having kids of my own is non-existent and the idea of having my own reliable new car is nonexistent.

(He used to live with us) in a small but comfortable apartment with a minimal rental cost. Before he also behaved irrationally but it was at the beginning, so I thought he had changed. now this despicable being. He verbally attacks my mother and asking her if she wants to leave the house that she should leave. do you know what that means? What kind of man treats a woman that way? and let alone a wife...

In short, all of this is my fault for keeping my mother and sister in this place, if I had decided to get ahead, possibly now I would have a better job and enough money to get us out of this hell.

I recently had a relapse where I thought about committing suicide, but now, I know there is no escape and I have to get my mother and sister out of this situation and give them lives they can enjoy.

The rents are expensive even for small apartments and they are in a bad and unsafe places. on the other hand, I lost my job a few days ago and I am unemployed

I don't know what to do, but God will provide and help us move forward.

I don't believe my therapist that I have depression, I stand there and think to myself what if I'm just pretending?

18xvdhx,Depression,2024-01-03,"Really, really struggling today. I feel like no one close to me understands.","I suffer with major alcohol use disorder and bipolar 2. Last summer I did a treatment center and that’s where I got diagnosed, but afterwards I went straight back to drinking thinking I could moderate.

Well that didn’t work so my husband and I decided to detox last week and stop drinking. The detox went well, I was good for about a day, then I absolutely plummeted into horrible depression. I’ve never experienced it to that level before so I thought I’d go back to drinking to get through the holidays. 

Fast forward to yesterday and I was able to detox again. The depression hit just as hard last night and has been going all day. I went to a doctor and all I can really do is not drink, take my meds, and just wait several weeks for it to get better. I just don’t see how that’s possible.

I’m just frustrated because I know my husband means well, but it’s been 1 week sober for him and he’s been completely fine. I on the other hand am terrified about being home alone (I don’t go back to work until next week).

I just don’t really feel like I have a support system and I don’t feel like I have anyone around me that knows what this feels like and can sympathize. 

I’m just tired of being told “just watch tv” or “read a book” or “crochet”. Do I like those things, yes. But that’s not just going to fix me. He feels like I’m not trying to do anything to help myself because I just lay in bed in silence.

I’m really tempted to drink just to get out of this misery. Even if it was just for tonight. 

Any advice?"
18xuswj,Depression,2024-01-03,Every day after work I try so hard to have a nice time,"And I just can’t make it happen 
At this point it just feels pathetic 
I keep cleaning my room and buying new activities and getting high and trying to find just the right lighting but I’ve been trying for months and I just can’t have a nice evening.
It’s partially the house I live in im sure. I can hear my mom and sister stomping around and screaming no matter how loud I turn up the music, my room has black mold and a stench I can’t get rid of, if I have to use the bathroom I’m confronted with an even worse level of filth.
I try To go out, get away from the house, but I only have one “friend” who is clearly getting tired of me
I think it’s been about a year since I last had a good time and I feel so deeply pathetic trying in vain every day to create a nice time"
18xurve,Depression,2024-01-03,How is it like being on antidepressants?,"Life is like a wave. When you go down, you feel bad. When it goes up, you are happy. Antidepressants just keep that wave flat. No ups, and downs. Is that a fair characterisation? It's what I've been told. 

My wave has been going down for a long time now, and I am just sick of it. The few ups I have are not worth the negative slope. I've been debating starting on antidepressants. Just to not feel anything. At least it'll get me out of bed in the morning. Maybe make life more tolerable. Can any of you give me your experience with antidepressants? Has it helped you? Do you recommend it. Why, or why not. "
18xur54,Depression,2024-01-03,Feeling like giving up,"My life sucks I have been sick for 3 weeks now and I ended up in the hospital. I’ve never been in a hospital before it’s pretty scary and it makes me go absolutely insane feeling so lonely, helpless and having nothing to do. Also I’m missing out on school and it’s almost the end of the semester so we have around 6 tests this week and 7 more next week and I’ll have to write them all next week when I come back. It makes me feel so lazy and useless cause I felt sick and couldn’t even study for any of my tests. All of this combined just makes me wanna die and I don’t really have anyone that’s close to talk to. I have social anxiety so making friends was always hard and I’m always the backup friend so no one reached out to talk to me other than two of my online friends which are really good but I wish some friend visited me. I don’t really know if this even makes much sense but for anyone reading this thank you."

18xuf17,Depression,2024-01-03,I’m on the verge of breaking down,I feel so useless. I’ve always been terrible at things or just average. Nothing special. I don’t have a passion for anything. I’ve been stuck for the past 8 years and I unintentionally sabotage myself. I don’t mean to do it I just do. I wish I could get help but I aged out my insurance and there’s no way in hell I can pay for anything without it. My relationships with my friends and family isn’t great either. They’ve given up on me. I don’t feel suicidal but I just wish I could die. I don’t want to burden anyone especially since it’s the New Year and everyone is optimistic but I just needed somewhere to vent.
18xudo9,Depression,2024-01-03,I know the reason im depressed,"This is honestly embarrassing for me to admit, I'm 16 years old right now and really struggling.  Throughout 4th-6th grade I felt like I didn't have any friends, I was lonely and I wanted attention.  I remember forcing myself to be sad every day at school, going out of my way to find things to be sad about because I wanted to feel like people cared about me.  I also hurt myself for attention too, and I regret it so much.  It's changed me so much as a person.  Now I have to deal with social anxiety, general anxiety, depression, etc.  it could have all been solved if I just hungout with friends more and I wasnt so petty and didnt overthink so much.  it just frustrates me so much to think about.  I wish things could've been different.  i'm trying as hard as I can to get over my anxieties and depression and it's just so hard.  I cant believe I did that as a kid, I have so much regrets and i dont know what to do about it"
18xuciu,Depression,2024-01-03,Is there any way out (other than the obvious)?,"It's been made very clear to me that I'm not important in anyone's lives and I'm fundamentally unlovable, broken and simply just a burden to the people around me and humanity in general. It's not something that's in my head, I've had it confirmed from various sources.


My question: What do I do now? How do I go on and do better? I don't want to be a burden, I don't want to be unlovable, I don't want to be someone that just complicates other people's lives. I'm alive at the moment and want to be someone that people miss when I'm not around, I want to be someone who people make time for the same way I make time for them, I want to make a positive contribution to people's lives and the world in general but everything I try is either rejected or backfires. Is there anything I can do to change this, other than the obvious? Is there any way to make my life not entirely worthless or is it a lost cause and I should just cut the losses and make it simpler for everyone?"
18xubhy,Depression,2024-01-03,I’m not doing that great…,"This is my first time posting here. I read people’s posts every day, multiple times a day and it breaks my heart reading some of your stories. I wish I could hug all of you. But the truth is, I’m struggling myself. I’m at a point in my life where my depression is at its worst. I have a hard time getting out of bed, brushing my teeth, taking a shower…basically everything I have to do to take care of myself. I used to be such a highly driven person, full of life. Always laughing and making jokes with friends and family. I had high hopes for myself and the biggest dreams with so much drive to fulfill them. Now I look in the mirror and see just a body…no soul. Did something cause me to be this way? Yes. And I only have myself to blame. 

I’m a 36F that is also a recovering opioid addict. I’ve been clean since December of 2021 and although I have my sobriety, everything else around me feels like it has gone to shit. You see, I’m a nurse that worked during COVID and unfortunately had a relapse. I was using for quite some time before a “friend” turned me in. That’s a whole other story in itself but irrelevant right now. I was lucky that I didn’t lose my license (just suspended for 8 months), but I lost myself in the process. I lost important people, my savings, accrued so much debt, my dignity etc. The thing is, I have the most amazing partner and friends that continue to be there for me but the truth is no one can fix me but myself. I think that’s the most frustrating thing is that I’m the only one that can take myself out of this funk but the depression is literally kicking my ass. I’m so overwhelmed with responsibilities that I have no idea how to handle everything. I just want to be normal again. I want the happy, funny, driven version of myself back because it’s so dark right now. 

Sorry for the long post. I just needed to let it out. I hope everyone in this group is having a better day &lt;3"

After 3 years and multiple weeks at rock bottom i finally feel happy. I realized how lucky i and we as humans are to experience different things in life. I want to live to do everything. I reccomend thinking like this. Realize how lucky you are, think about the beutiful things you can do. My will to live has solidified. I am happy to be alive. And you should be too."
18xuaul,Depression,2024-01-03,Everyday life is difficult for me,"  
The most everyday actions cost me a lot. Getting up in the morning, cooking, working. I force myself to do everything because I live alone and no one can do anything for me, but the truth is I would like to just let myself die. I don't do it out of love for my girlfriend and my family, I no longer care about myself enough to stay alive on my own. Plus I'm hypersensitive, the same people I love make me sensitive, and it's not even that they do anything wrong. I have a lot of anxiety about my future, I am not in a good economic situation and in three months I will change to a job that pays less, I have no choice for now but to take that job. Nothing better has come out for me. It is very exhausting to live like this. When I say these things to my girlfriend I feel ashamed, I'm afraid she'll leave me because of this, because it can't be easy for her either. I haven't had the courage to tell my family about how I feel. I don't want to worry them. At the same time, pretending I'm fine only adds to my exhaustion..."
18xu41b,Depression,2024-01-03,Caught myself holding a sharp object to my wrist,"On Christmas day, I was thinking about a random or insignificant thing, that I can't remember.

I feel as if I had an out of body experience where I knew what was happening but felt disconnected to it somehow. Next I know, I glance over, spot a box cutter, grabbed it and brought it to my wrist.

I have no idea what ""snapped"" me out of it but I'm glad it did.  Not because of the fear or shock of it (as I have desires to end it all), but because I don't want to have my family find me in that position/situation, DOA. 

Are my suicidal thoughts escalating? I've never attempted or hurt myself any way. I always felt like when I do it, I need to get it right and final. Am I reaching the point of not caring if they find me and how they will be affected by it? Have I reached the limit of being alive for others and not living nor have much desire to live for me? I am not sure how to feel about this."

I have never had a friend or even someone to go out. When I was at school/university I were just able to talk about school and exams, but I never saw anybody outside of lessons. I passed all my weekends alone with my parents in my room. Now I work (I studied engineering and I work as mechanical designer) but all my work mates are 50 years old so I don't have anything in common. I have never even talked to a girl. I feel so isolated from the world, I cry almost every night. I think I'm hopeless, I tried 3 times therapy but it was useless. I just would like someone to talk with, to receive a message from someone.  I don't have interests or hobby, I abandoned everything being alone all this time. I like just listening to rock music.

18xspsz,Depression,2024-01-03,Why have do I feel weak for expressing my own emotions or sharing traumatic experiences with my close friends?,"I have always felt very weak when I share things to anyone, this includes my closest friends. I have always struggled with it but trying to get over it has been extremely hard. I beat myself up for being dramatic or not trying enough when after I tell people things. I find that because I told someone else it makes it “less bad” because I’m not dealing with it alone. I have a close friend, and I know I shouldn’t compare myself to her, but she doesn’t really confide in other people. Since this is how I mostly am, and since I’ve learned to view this as the “toughest” or “strongest” thing you can do, I feel horrible. I feel that compared to her I am not “strong enough” or “tough enough.” I feel that I am being dramatic and that I need to suck it up. I know this is a horrible way to think, and that the reasons why she keeps to herself are similar to mine, but as I’ve tried to become more open to my close friends and actually ask for help, when I see that she is holding her own in makes me feel like a child, like I’m not tough enough. I know that is a horrible thing to think/to say. I just don’t understand why it’s so hard for me to work through this fear of being weak and sharing things from my life with others."
18xsfoh,Depression,2024-01-03,Experiencing fatigue and existential hollowness,"Over the past year i had been switched on and off of different anxiety and depression meds. Recently i am on a new one that has helped stopped suicidal thoughts and hopefully put me on the right track. Where i am struggling is with the fatigue and, what i call, being stuck in my head. 
In these moments where i feel stuck i think about small things to do to move forward but also my place where my life is currently at. At times it ranges from just my job to being a citizen of my country all the way to humanities place in the universe. The small things i think about keep me moving and maintaining my day to day, but they feel so pointless. 
I can't help but look at things and people and feel how small and petty what i do is. It's like i peeled a layer of depression off the weight on me revealing a new existential pointlessness. My place in the world and universe is so small that i feel i can't even enjoy happy memories from how fleeting it all is. 
I am tired all the time and the inner voice in my head has gotten so loud. I'm constantly shouting at myself that I'm barely a blink, working to make things that will last less than that, in an industry that's indifferent of its surroundings or affects on people or communities. 
I do think i am slowly getting better but i wasn't ready for a new vaster feeling of pointlessness. I don't know how to reconcile how meaningless everything still feels despite not wanting to die anymore"

Financially my family background is average but i am basically a burden on my parents but they still support me of course they say its their duty but obviously everyone understands about unemployment. I have been unemployed now for over 6months with no savings, i my lnternship i was working for free as it was unpaid. 
Fortunately i have good friends and parents who are always there to support me. But there are many of the things i dint told them. And i will mostly keep it to myself. I am a mess and i dont know what to do i am so scared of my future i know i wont take any wrong steps. 
Lastly, there is this girl that i like very much from my school and  its been like 7+ years i have no gut to talk to her i am so scared that i would fuck it up one or the other way. At this point i just want to talk to her but i am no good talking to girls.

I’m home and I’m still so troubled. I wake up and just cry all day long. I cry and I cry about seemingly nothing. I spend the day fantasizing about the end of my existence, and that’s about it. My life is meaningless. I am worth nothing. Why am I here and why am I like this?? Why is it that everyone else around me can tolerate life just a tad bit better than I can? Why do I crumble at the basic life stressors? Why do I feel this insane magnetic pull towards ending my life? What am I trying to escape?

I have like a tendency to bang/punch my head but I always assumed I was just being a bit silly since whenever I do that I'm like inconsolable or whatever. See, that was my thought process until I was in a very bad situation where everything was just so wrong and I started banging my head into the floor until I kinda lost my vision for a second (whoops) 

Yeah so the whole losing vision thing made me think ""Oh maybe this isn't just me being silly"" and I'm wondering if this is indicative of like a deeper issue. I mean, I don't think I'm depressed, I'm like chill most of the time, until I'm not y'know? "
18xs44y,Depression,2024-01-03,At a Crossroads,"Hello just feel like I need to write out my life and just get the darkness out of me. As I feel myself hung up on too much lately. 

Background/

I’m a 25 year old Canadian, grew up in the east coast of Canada in a single mother family with 3 boys. 

Call it unmotivated or lazy but my mother only did what was required as a parent food and shelter , she didn’t really try hard for us or work she was on “Welfare” that’s about it, For context  I knew Santa wasn’t real by about as early as I can remember in whatever childhood I had but was told I had to keep it a secret as I couldn’t ruin it for other children. 

Now growing up poor I always wanted things I couldn’t get that others had, nice clothes , new toys , gaming consoles etc. This forced me to just hurry up and want to work I started at 13 putting in about 20-28hrs a week as a dishwasher at one of the local restaurants in my small town. 

To my surprise, as soon as I started making money and buying things for myself suddenly, my mother told me we were struggling, and I had to help out with monthly costs. 

I only stayed at this job for about 4 months to turned 14 to move to a superstore grocery clerk and was treated much better. 

Fast forward a few years I’m now 17 I never had serious relationships. I never had sexual partners. I had very few close friends, but was Social enough at school that I was friendly with other kids, but not good friends with them.

 I’d like to think I wasn’t left out and people were pretty decent to me for example  always got invited to parties or whatever the majority of the outside of school events were, but I always never went as I was always strictly focussed on work. 

Now, on the positive side, I had made quite a name for myself at the grocery store at 17 I was a part-time full time assistant manager of the grocery department most weeks I would get 40 hours well in high school and there are even some weeks that because other kids had to go to sporting events or just didn’t wanna come into work that I could average 50 hours of work 10 hours of overtime, and I never complained about how much I was making keep in mind I have been paying more than half the bills for my mother and it’s just her and I living in the house at this point. 

Now fast forward to my 18th birthday. 

One of my coworkers who had spent over 32 years with this company had a great conversation and told me I would make a good lier at the organization. I don’t know what happened at that point it caused me to want to leave the town and look for something better so I applied to the Canadian military. 

The application process took about 8 months to get in and I did it, on the day, I swore I tried to ask my mother to come to it with me. She must’ve taken this personal as she refused to talk to me or come and support me on this day. I won’t give the exact date, but it took from the day I swear in to about three working weeks later when I started my basic training, still no contact with my mother since that day (at the time). 

Life in basic. 

Now I joined the military because I thought it was for a better cause it would create more structure in my life give me a way to get as far away from home as possible which was the most important factor of joining as possible ,build a career for me. Not many people in my town could say they have as a stable job.

Aside from catching an illness that almost killed me losing 67 pounds in seven weeks, but still making it through my basic and witnessing one suicide and two attempts I was proud of myself. I’d stop paying my mother’s things as she wasn’t talking to me I was about to go on to my trade training in Ontario and I had met one of my best friends who has done everything in the military with me aside from separate deployments.


Fast forward some more years about 6 to about now. 

At this point in my life, I have been deployed to Europe, I’ve completed dozens of exercise spending over 3.5 total years of field ops or deployment operation time aside from garrison life. 
 found a good lady put a ring on her, on better terms with my mother even flew her out for my wedding paid for her entire trip , had a newer car dog and a cat life’s going fast I feel worn down but had a is what it is mindset for what feels like forever. 


BUT NOW

Life feels empty. I’m constantly in my head if I want to stay in the military or not I now hate work as the politics have changed in a negative way that I do not support, i’ve realized it’s a boys club, and there’s so much favouritism and corruption and I must keep quiet in order to keep my job although I feel trapped I’m not confident in my battle buddies or my Troops in today’s military but I’m told I’m the only one feeling this way

My life outside of work feels shit most days  as I’m losing more control of all of my peace, don’t have much control over my own  expenses due to my previous problem. I feel suicidal but believe suicide is a cowards way out and I see all the reason I haven’t done it. My wife is in a hurry to buy a house and I just don’t think we are ready for it. Especially with me wanting to switch careers again.

We agreed we aren’t interested in children due to the state of the world and our views on modern parenting ,before marriage but deep down I feel like she wants them. I love her and she loves me at least I think but we are certainly finding that marriage life some what different.

I feel like I’m losing a grip on my year, my joy the good memories I have and I’m still young. 

I used to be so happy even at the worst times in my life now I’m so pessimistic about everything. 

I was thinking about trying antidepressants, but never been a medicine guy.  


So yeah that’s pretty much what’s in my head these days thank you for reading if you made it this far, it’s pretty bad that my new years resolution last year was just to finish it alive and it’s the same goal I set for myself this year.

Hope for better days."

I'm in therapy for depression so ig that's why I'm writing here I think I need advice.
My best friend of almost 5 years basically told me to go fuck myself because apparently my humor is weird im anti social and rude because I'm quiet.
Worst thing is all I could feel was emptiness. 
I wasn't sad
Angry
Or anything I just put down the phone and starred into the wall for 10m.
Next day at school ""feelt"" the exact same thing and just went on.
I feel terrible when I forget about this sometimes and I don't even know why.
It's just blurry and kinda scary 
It's like this with most things atm.
It's probably stupid but I'm actually stressing over being some sort of a sociopath which is ridiculous because I cry probably every opportunity I get. Dog videos. Letters from my gf ect. I can feel things is what I'm getting at. It's just rn everything just feels blurry.

I remember being able to enjoy hobbies to the fullest, without them making me hate myself more. I remember being able to smile without it being either bittersweet or fake. I remember crying when I was sad, because I remember when sadness was an event, something different. I remember when these feelings were the exception, not the rule.

I remember when I felt normal. But that's just so alien now. Apologies, pretty cliche ramble I just need somewhere to talk about this. In my family's monetary position we can't easily afford therapy, and when it comes to mental health issues everyone seems to brush the possibility off with me. I've got next to nobody who *really* listens, so- there's a few words to listen to. If you want. Do with them what you will."
18xrfvo,Depression,2024-01-03,Tired,"So am a 27 year old M and am tired of everything honestly, life has been hard and now it’s even harder because in order to avoid all the extra  stress I gathered for the last few months  I have shut down my emotions and good nature to just work so much to the point I don’t go home anymore not that it’s a safe space anyway. 
I found that work is the only thing that is  quieting my mind and so I keep doing it until I collapse which in turn adds to what I have piled up which did put me in the hospital just last week, I turned into an unsympathetic person who does not give a shit about other people. 
I just work and do whatever I have to do in order to advance in my career because of my newly strong beliefs that while money does not buy happiness, it does buy  freedom from the world’s expectations and will let me do what I want which will turn into happiness hence I decided to shut down emotionally due to all the damage I feel from it maybe until I get to my goal.
Thanks to anyone who reads this, I just had to get it off my chest"

18xr93y,Depression,2024-01-03,I don’t think I could ever tell my father my mental health problems. Even after a fucking hospital visit.,"If I try, it’s not going to end well. I know that because I tried multiple times in the past. Then I’ll think that I’m delusional and bratty. To him, my mental health problems is a product of my atheistic views. Also, I know people have it worse than me. Being told that makes me feel worse about being depressed. I don’t choose to be depressed or have panic attacks. It just happens. It bothers me that I can only tell my fucking mother about these problems, but not my dad. I can’t tell him “oh I’m having a panic attack”. On top of that, I cannot have mental health problems because I’m black. 

Thankfully there are people out there who actually listen. It sucks that it can’t be my own father. I don’t know if I can actually be open about these problems without being told I’m overreacting or that I’m wrong. Lying like this makes me sick sometimes, but what else could I do."

I self sabotage and hurt myself because I feel like it somewhat offsets the guilt and that I'm ridding the world of everything bad the more I hurt myself.

18xqw8k,Depression,2024-01-03,Extreme Anxiety and depression is tormenting me suddenly,"30/m from UK. Please see below:

I am someone who has had social anxiety my whole life as well as Hypothyroidism. My thyroid issue has generally been good through my life as I am carefully monitored with blood tests. Recently, My thyroid levels have shot up to high after taking 200mg of Levothyroxine for 3 months following my pharmacy’s advice. Now they want to bring it down to 75mg. Most of my life I’ve been taking 75mg to 100mg of Levothyroxine so I felt it was quite odd to be told to start 200mg.

Anxiety: This is bothering me the most. My anxiety has shot through the roof in the last week so much so I had to go to the Emergency room. They checked my blood pressure and confirmed it was high. They did an ECG but never gave me the results or didn’t feel the need to. All that doctor said was he thinks it’s my high thyroid levels and the sudden and dramatic change in Levothyroxine dose. He ended it saying he is not going to give me anything and that I’m going to have to wait it out out for a few weeks. My family doctor did a blood test just before all of this happened and confirmed my thyroid levels are high. Thus, she told me to take 75mg Levothyroxine rather than 200mg (I was taking 200 for the last 2-3 months) and that she will do another blood test to monitor levels. It is like I have someone else’s brain - I am getting very strange intrusive thoughts about suicide and calling myself a loser for living with my parents at 30. Before, I never thought about suicide or cared whether I am 30 and living with parents. I am thinking about how I haven’t saved up properly and that my life is over. Because of this anxiety, I am reading constant Reddit posts and YouTube videos about if I should worry about living with parents or not and I do see alot saying things like, “If I was living with my parents at 32 I would commit suicide” or “If you are living with your parents in your 30s you are a life failure” and I even forced myself to watch a video of Jimmy Kimmel putting down someone for living with their parents. 

Vision: My vision goes blurry (noticed when I am working) and that in turn is making it harder for me to focus or care about my work.

Tired/Insomnia: I am feeling very tired all the time. That said, I am not sleeping very well at all. In fact, I probably got 4-5 hours of sleep in the last two nights. 

Confusion: I occasionally feel disorientated and confused as if I’m living in a simulation. It is a very strange and unpleasant feeling. 

I feel like a junkie. I am constantly worrying about every single thing. How I envy older people because they are going to die sooner than me. I was on Xanax and Risperidone before and I was not thinking the way I am now. I want/am coming off all anxiety medication because I don’t want to keep taking them. It’s confusing what is causing my extreme levels of anxiety if it’s withdrawal from the two medicines or it’s because of Hyperthyroidism or the sudden significant change in Levothyroxine levels. 

Please any assistance would be much appreciated because I am genuinely crying inside. I don’t feel myself at all. I love my parents and brother a lot and they love me and have done everything for me and so I feel guilty feeling like this. I want to continue living with them because I am just happy with the support network. I don’t have hardly any friends and so living alone would really impact my mental health. I’m just torturing myself reading those Reddit posts or watching those YouTube videos because it just makes the problem worse.

How long will it take for my Hyperthyroidism to subside to normal? I have been taking 75mg for almost a week now."
18xqqr3,Depression,2024-01-03,I feel lost and unhappy.,"For as long as I can remember now I've left unhappy, I'm 22 years old and each time something happens in my life I feel like I feel less and less happy. For example when I was in school, I thought I'd be happy when I leave. I wasn't, then I thought I got a job I'd be happy, I wasn't, then last year I managed to get myself into an apprenticeship and I am more depressed than I've ever been, and I'm thinking I was happier at the retail job I had before, and I was unhappy then.

I just don't know when the cycle ends. Will I ever be happy? Will I ever find a job that doesn't make me feel like I'm being dragged along? It also worries me that my future goals will give me this awful feeling of wishing things stayed the same, like getting a house or having kids.

I don't feel like I'm good at anything, I have no hobbies I can realistically pursue as a career. I'm not clever or talented. I just know that I don't want to feel like this.

Does anyone have any advice for me?"

My husband is supportive but I feel that I don’t have him in this parenting phase by my side right from the day of delivery. He was always busy with his office work. Don’t found him having his priorities changed. I’m in my maternity leave right now but soon my leaves will be over and I don’t know how would I be able to manage everything. I sometimes miss my old times with him. I started to believe I have lost my husband after baby. I don’t know what to think and what to expect. I’m so sad and alone.

18xq4nm,Depression,2024-01-03,GOD PLEASE TAKE ME HOME! (back to normal),"THIS IS WORSE THAN DEPRESSION!!!How am I supposed to live like this?
 
DPDR/ANHEDONIA

I'm literally feeling like ""living death/zombie""


First of all I have never taken any drugs!

I got this 2 months ago because of extreme stress and anxiety. I had soo bad headaches (squzzing,tension,brain zaps,ice pick)

I have anxiety and depression for 6 years now. (21M)

Now Im Feeling like my nervous system is ""FRIED""
What the Fu*k is this? I feel STUCK! 

Symptoms I have:anhedonia, cant focus and concentrate, Im here but not here,life seems like a bad dream all the time, everything looks fake,night feels more empty and darker,cant feel ahappiness ""inside me"", even my emotions feels so fake...its hard to describe. 
I can only feel anger inside of me...I just wanna live.

Im 101% sure it is a brain damage...I didbCT scan, blood test, EEG, almost everything and everything was clear. But still thinking its a brain damage.

I got prescribed Seroxat(Paroxetine) and Xanax

Seroxat didnt help at all which is REALLY REALLY weird.
Xanax helped (for headaches) only.



Is there any type of pill/antidepressant, supplement which can help?"
18xpmfl,Depression,2024-01-03,"not sure if this is the right place, but just wanted to process some things..","i'm a teacher and my mental health has really sucked over Christmas break... it's almost like a two week break from the structure and routine has exposed what was there all along, or i'm just that desperate for the built-in accountability that ""work"" provides

been on Vyvanse for a few months now for ADD, which has helped a little bit in terms of getting 'unstuck' in my own thoughts and inaction... unfortunately, the Vyvanse has not done much for me in terms of the depression and anxiety, especially at home

went back to the doctor and the nurse practitioner gave me a sample of Trintellix to go along with the Vyvanse... i didn't think much of it or ask many questions, but after going home and researching the drug a little bit (possible side effects/interactions, PRICE, etc.) i'm not sure if it's the best option for me... currently no generic and the cost would be around $500 a month (i am not eligible for a Trintellix savings card)

called the doctor and left a message with the nurse who was going to share my concerns with the nurse practitioner... tempted to just go ahead and start the 21 day sample to at least get something in my system moving forward, but not sure if this is a good idea (guess i should ask the nurse... i just hate jumping through all the hoops and call menu options to get ahold of someone)

they did order a ""brain scan"" which i guess may give us a little more info regarding some of this? sounds intense (and expensive) but maybe it will be helpful

""masturbation addiction"" is also becoming somewhat of an issue for me, as i just want to feel good... it seems to provide a sort of low-hanging fruit, but typically i end up just feeling worse afterwards

i've been seeing multiple online therapists off and on for a while now, which has been somewhat helpful, but certainly not the ""quick fix"" i think i am hoping for (i know quick fixes are probably a pipe dream, i'm just concerned with the lack of progress i feel like i'm seeing)

my desire to engage in any kind of physical activity, exercise, etc. has also been at an all-time low, which i'm sure isn't helping... i don't even really want to play video games, which is usually a go-to coping mechanism, especially during dark days

about the only thing i kind of want to do that feels somewhat productive is write music and make songs (unfortunately, it's very difficult for me to separate this desire from my desire for acceptance and approval in the form of likes and views)

like i said, when i'm in the middle of the teaching grind i don't notice these symptoms as much, but seeing how strongly they have resurfaced over the break definitely makes me wonder if they were there all along and just hadn't been dealt with...

i have two fears moving forward:

1) i'm going to spend a bunch of money (that we don't have) turning over all these rocks trying to find problems and solutions, only to wake up with the same nagging depression and anxiety (and hundreds, if not thousands of dollars in medical bills that we can't afford)

2) i'll go back to school next week, get busy again, and move my mental health to the back burner, eventually leading  it to boil over in a way that could be far more damaging to myself and my family  


thanks for reading... i know requesting or giving ""clinical"" advice is against the rules, but if anyone has any suggestions or has experienced something similar, would love to hear your story! thanks"

18xpg9z,Depression,2024-01-03,My boyfriend told me he stays with me because he's scared I would harm myself if he left.,"I have been living with my boyfriend for a year now, dating 3 years. 

I have also been dealing with depression for about 5 years, but I have been doing better lately; stopped medications 9 months ago, therapy sessions are not weekly but monthly now, overall I felt that I was having good progress. I moved out of my country with him to pursue a better life, and Christmas was a good time as well (or so I thought.)

My family invited me over to visit them, but my boyfriend couldn't come (visa issues,) and they didn't bother inviting him either - they don't like him one bit. While I was away with my family (2 days only), they discussed with me that they weren't comfortable with the 'lack of formality' of our relationship... AKA living together without being married. 

They kept commenting on how disappointed they are that I'm living a more difficult life in another country while they could have helped me out in my home country. (I do not believe that, because when I was living with them I was doing so much worse; no stable job, no independence whatsoever.) 

Their comments got to me, and when I came back I was feeling very low in general. I talked with my boyfriend about how this makes me feel useless and just plain up a failure, I'm in my mid 20s and haven't done much besides graduating with a BA for an area with no job opportunities. 

He got upset and told me that he's tired of me being sad all the time, or just unhappy in general, that there's nothing else he feels he can say to make me feel better and that he's scared to leave me because he doesn't want me to hurt myself. He considered calling my parents yesterday to ask them to help me out instead because he doesn't know what to do anymore, and he doesn't see a future with me if I'm so unstable. 

He told me he wants me to get better, and that he loves me, but he feels like he can't help me. I was taken aback, to say the least, because I thought I had been doing so much better, and wasn't aware that he was feeling this way. It was in no way my intention to make him feel responsible for my mental health. 

I don't know what to do, he tells me he doesn't want to break up, but that I have to get better in order for us to be alright. I don't know if he's saying this because he legitimately wants us to be better as a couple, or just because he's afraid I'll do something bad - which I wouldn't, I have never attempted hurting myself or others, and I don't plan on starting now. not when I have progressed this much :(

I'm torn, I don't even know if I can move past the fact that he's been pitying me for a while and it's one of the reasons why he stays with me. ""Of course I love you too, but I'm worried for you.'' Loving me shouldn't be the \*second\* reason for staying with me I guess, I don't even know if I'm overthinking it way too much.

I don't think I am codependent; frankly speaking, I legit think he is the love of my life and he makes me want to be better, but I don't want to put someone on a pedestal if all I am to him is a depressed and sad GF who, in theory, could be so much more, but in practice is just that. I contacted my therapist already but I would appreciate some advice."
18xpdcv,Depression,2024-01-03,I'm extremely lonely and I don't know how to deal with it.,"I 22M was diagnosed with major depressive disorder as well as social anxiety disorder in august 2023 and ever since then my relationship with my family has been awful. My siblings are basically trying to act like I'm faking having a mental disorder for attention and refuse to talk to me. My mom won't contribute to any conversation we have anymore, she'll just remain silent the entire time so it's impossible to talk to her about anything now even just small talk has become impossible. My dad on the other hand takes every opportunity to lecture me and he just disregards everything I say. It's not like I haven't been trying to get better, I workout 2 to 3 hours every day, I've been reading and been doing me
ditation sessions daily to try to improve my outlook on life. I really just want to be happy but every time I reach out to my family I feel like shit and it's doing nothing for me.

Even if I decide to get toghether with my friends it just doesn't feel right anymore, we always enjoyed hanging out but now we rarely ever do and when we do it's usually just to play video games. I miss the days when we used to actually do things toghether. I don't even really enjoy gaming anymore, I just game because it's the only time I actually get to spend time with my friends but even that is becoming a rare occurrence.

I just feel so alone now, I'm living but just for myself there's nothing that I do that I actually enjoy. If I wasn't working out daily I probably would've killed myself by now, it's the only thing that distracts me from my thoughts and gives me something real to work towards. But it doesn't change anything, I'm trying to be a better person but what's the point if there's nobody in my life that I can actually spend time with. I'm sick of living for myself I just want to matter to someone and it's clear that the people in my life right now aren't the people I'm looking for. But I don't know how to find these people or if I even have anything to offer them if I find them. I just get so anxious when I'm around other people  and I don't know how to deal with that pressure. I feel like my depression and social anxiety feed into eachother and I have to break that cycle. I can minimize my anxiety and depression through my lifestyle but I can't move any further until I develop social skills. What do I need to do in order to do this?"

When all I have known in this thing called life is just me walking inside an endless tunnel with no escape to be found. 

When all I have experienced is dissapointment after dissapointment.

When the hard truth is that people are the worst. 

When others keep telling me it gets better is a big fat lie. It doesn’t.

When all celebrations in life such as new year, birthdays, christmas, meant nothing anymore to me. 

When I know the world is turning into a crazy one. Kindness will only get trampled over by  the greedy, selfish, and ignorant ones.

When I know for a fact that innocent people suffers way more than those who must be held accountable.

When the world is superficial and nothing real matters anymore.

I’m at my wits end. I genuinely think what could be worst thing in the after life than what I have experienced here? I wish I could trade life with those who deserves and needs it more, the ones who still have family or loved ones that cares about them. 

I can leave this world just fine. The world is just fine without me.

I’m not doing well at all and I find it so hard to go to school and no one knows I’m not doing well, I don’t want to talk to anyone about how I feel. 2023  peaked as the worst year as I lost a very big parental figure in my life and not even 2 weeks later, I lost my dog. I’m not coping well anymore but I just can’t bring myself to tell anyone. With a loss like mine people constantly asked me “how are u doing so well?” “If I was u I would be so sad”, but half the time I feel nothing and the other time I just feel so hopeless and sad I can’t stop crying.

18xny55,Depression,2024-01-03,I need help fr,So I've been dating this girl for around 2 years now and we've fought a couple times but the other night was so bad. I found she she sent a picture of her promise ring to her ex to make him jealous she also tried calling him a couple times. Obviously this makes me upset and yet she never gives true apologies it's actually starting to piss me off. I'm a very patient person and I just wanted to be happy with someone. She said her ex did her dirty and that I was the best boyfriend she's ever had so why the fuck is she still thinking about him🥲 can I get advice please lol?

So this extra time should be all a good thing right? No, I've fucked everything up that I could. I've never accomplished anything. I never helped anyone. I fucked up every single aspect of my life up to this point. I'm almost 32 and all I have to show for it is a list of people I've hurt. People that didn't deserve it. People that I loved, but was too selfish to walk away from before I did the damage I always do. People that I've even tricked into loving me. I have 3 kids now and I've ruined their lives even because I just kept going and trying to make something, anything of my life even though I knew I'd be here. Since I was a kid I've felt broken. I mean, I was beaten so much, I'd pray to god for my parents to to be taken. I mean, if they couldn't love me, maybe I really always have been just some thing that fucks up everything I touch. Now I've got a broken wife and broken relationships because I was I didn't just quit while I was ahead so to speak. I've always been too much of a coward to end it. But maybe 2024 is the year. Maybe ive just been trying to ignore the signs thatnits finally time. I always believed in fate because how could so many coincidences happen? I've met people in such specific circumstances that I can't truly believe it was an accident. But for some reason, I try to defy what I've felt was ""fate"" as that small child about being alone and meaning something to someone and I've got that list of people I've hurt because of it. So I guess I'm an idiot too. Some people just don't learn I guess. Well...hopefully this post gets lost in the ether too like the other ones. If you read this, sorry about that too."

18xmm3i,Depression,2024-01-03,What is wrong with me?,"
 Hello everyone, I hope your day is going great!

I'm making a post because I'm very concerned about my mental health. Last few months have been awful. I don't know what is wrong with me. I feel very unmotivated and down, I don't want to do anything and I'm completely changing as a person. I used to be more extrovert and very optimistic, and now I can't even start a conversation properly and I feel always very sad, for no reason. I feel very alone and rejected by people. They seem to avoid me. The thing is that I can't identify the problem. I'm very grateful for the life I have, and there doesn't seem to be any problems with it, but for some reason I'm like this. It seems to be getting much worse, but I just can't figure out what is causing this. 
 I must add that last year I promised myself I would change. I used to be very lazy and procrastinate all the time, and my grades were very average. So I decided to change that, and my grades are now very good and I was feeling better with myself, but now I'm getting back to what I used to be. 
 This is absolutely destroying me and today was probably my worst day ever.

TLDR: I (17M), feel very depressed even though I don't know what is causing it. Can't have conversations nor make friends because I'm becoming a boring and apathetic person. Becoming less and less expressive everyday."
18xmfr1,Depression,2024-01-03,Starting IOP for depression and anxiety,"I’ve seen so many posts talking about people’s opinions on Intensive Outpatient but i figured I would make my own because they were all pretty old. 
My doctor recommended IOP for me because I have essentially failed every class for my last 3 semesters of college, could not leave my bed etc. And also because I explained to him that the therapist I have been seeing for a long time never really helped with anything. I felt like we never got to the root cause of my illness, or at least anything meaningful. This may be my fault, which is partially why im worried about IOP. I was recommended this for my passive suicidal thoughts and severe social anxiety. 
My fear is that because I made almost 0 progress in several years of therapy, that I won’t be able to make anything out of the IOP program. On top of that, because of my crippling social anxiety, group therapy terrifies me, which is basically the whole program. I know exposure therapy is the best way to get over it but I’m a 22 y/o senior in college and I feel like a scared little kid and I hate it. 
I’m just worried that this 2 week program will be like my last 7 years of therapy and make my situation worse. 

Looking for advice, words of encouragement, I don’t really know - whatever input you may have. 

I’m scared and I don’t want to be."

It's gotten worse recently. I couldn't keep a job because I don't have motivation anymore. I don't work, I don't go out, I don't talk to girls, I just don't want to do anything. I feel so worthless and tired. Every morning, I think about ending it all.

18xm01r,Depression,2024-01-03,Feeling like I don't belong anywhere,"Hello everyone.

This is my first post on this thread, I guess I'm hoping to receive some support for what I'm about to share. 

I am a 26 year old male, currently living on my own in Italy (I am in fact, italian).

As the title suggests, I'm at the point of completely breaking, and I wouldn't really be able to articulate what exactly my issue is. I've been single for 10 months. A couple of weeks ago my ex girlfriend, who I broke up with, contacted me to tell me she has an STD and suggesting I should get tested, although she knew I take occasional sperm tests to check up on a condition I've been dealing with for years. These tests include checking for STDs and I had never had any until I was with her (and ofc I never cheated on her). I suspect she only did this out of spite, as she probably wanted to get back at me for ending our relationship. I have other elements to support this (which is only marginally relevant here), as the whole reason for me breaking up with her was her passivity and insecurities, which led to her (as she admitted herself) using me more for validation than actually loving me. She's tried to send signals and get my attention through social media for months, but I never indulged her until the messages she sent me.

Our relationship ended cause it became very one-sided, she wasn't giving me any insight and wasn't very stimulating a person. I was basically a father figure for her, as she later admitted, and no effort of mine to talk about these problems changed her behavior.

After the break up I was able to refocus on myself, finish my master's thesis and rediscover some of my passions (playing chess, studying history, watching movies, jogging), but lately it's been terribly negative. I contracted mononucleosis and it forced me to stay in bed for almost a month, two of my grandparents have passed away and my work has become stale and uninteresting. My dating life is abysmal. I have met several girls and gone on dates, but it seems I can't create any connections with anyone. I tried hooking up with one girl, but I didn't like it at all, as I struggle a lot with intimacy and connecting sexually and this felt just embarassing. 

I don't really know who I am anymore. I'm losing drive to do anything, I'm losing interest in doing the things I liked. I got back on dating apps, but I am struggling to find anything meaningful or interesting  to say to anyone I match with. As guys are usually supposed to initiate things, this is a considerable problem if I wanna get to know anyone.

I long for physical affection, but also feel heartbroken knowing my ex partner already found someone else, despite not wanting to go back with her. It just sucks that someone who's acting so childishly and had almost never anything interesting to say (I don't say this out of hatred, she was basically a doormat) can find someone, while I can't.

I am stuck reminiscing about a past I'm glad I moved away from, and can't find any motivation or optimism about my future.

I'm giving therapy a try, but so far (I'm 4 sessions in) I'm not feeling any different.

Have you ever been in a similar spot? Do things get better?"
18xlwjz,Depression,2024-01-03,Proof I’m invisible and a loser,"Got a few invites for new year’s and was going to go to the party a friend of a friend was hosting, since he usually hosts NYE and other ‘fireworks holidays’ lol since he has a good view of where they usually set them off.

He texted again morning of the party with more details. The friends I know him through couldn’t make it this year because they were sick, but I know him and the other people going well enough that it didn’t change my plans. 

He lives close by, so I walked over and buzzed (condo, can’t use the elevator without being buzzed in)…he didn’t answer. Buzzed again…still no answer. Not unusual for him, he’s bad at keeping his phone on him, but usually our mutual friends are already at the party so I can just call them to get him to check his phone. So I texted him to let me know when he saw the message and I’d try buzzing again, waited maybe 5 mins and left to hang out on my couch instead because I wasn’t feeling it, and didn’t want to go to a different party either by that point. 20 mins after I sent my message he texts back apologizing and explaining that someone he travelled with recently tested positive for covid so he had to cancel a couple hours ago, but forgot to text and fell asleep on the couch.

I’m assuming since he ‘cancelled’ the party that means he did in fact tell SOME people that it was cancelled, but forgot to tell me. Which really plays into all my childhood wounds of being invisible and unimportant and a total loser from when I was basically an outcast for a few years in elementary school and also just feeling invisible and unseen in my family since always.

I have massive feelings about this incident now, and I know it probably seems really dramatic to be so hurt by it but I feel pretty confident in my assumption that I was the only one forgotten, and feel so much freaking shame and also anger. 

Honestly don’t know the point of this post, I just feel so hurt by it it’s insane so I needed to get it out. Thanks for reading if you made it this far lol."
18xlwi3,Depression,2024-01-03,I don’t see the road ahead.,"
I (21M) have been struggling with depression for a long while. Its not just depression I did get diagnosed with mixed personality disorder and occasionally being psychotic. I might also be autistic and it is planned for me to take a test for it. In 2023 I have spent 3 months in a theraputic center and after a failed suicide attempt in the summer 3 weeks in a psych ward. I have a psychiatrist and a psychologist. But honestly its just feels like running in circles. I have been on and off different theraphies in the past 5 years, also a bunch of meds. I had my fist suicidal thoughts at the age of like 15. The one attempt I mentioned is my first serious attempt. I took like 5000 mgs of kventiax, for those who know what that is. It induced a lot of pain and when I woke up in the middle of the night I couldn’t stand or walk, so I had to crawl to the kitchen for water. I slept for like 18 hours, when I woke up I couldn’t see clearly but the next day I was all fine. The thing is, there is not a day that passes where I didn’t wish to have died there. Here comes the big issue, I realized that for the past like 5 years I have been only planning my death, plans on how to kill myself from plan A to Z. I never planned to be alive at this point. I basically feel like a reverse ghost, I am here in body but nothing else. I do have an ~80% full box of sleeping pills, I think that should work, but I am afraid of waking up again. Also, I do have a girlfriend, and I cannot do that to her. She is sweet and I love her a lot, but I am thinking of leaving and just letting myself fall. Because she is basically the last line of defense. Also I do fear that the attempt fails again, maybe having greater consequences than the last and I really don’t want to go the psych ward. I live in Hungary, it is really not a good country to go into the psych ward in. Still I think it is pretty much over for me, maybe I will last a year or two but not much more than that. I did start an online course for digital drawing and also I have made a pretty cool board game which is really close to being finished so I should soon contact a publisher. But I just don’t care that much anymore, there is nothing in this life which I would choose over just not existing and I have no clue how to go forward."

Dreams of a secure marriage, a dependable car, a sanctuary to call home – all meticulously planned and saved for. Then, in a cruel twist of fate, it vanished. Every cent, meticulously earned, swallowed by a heartless scam, leaving behind a gaping void where hope once resided.

For context I'm 25, no friends, still live at home with parents, I only leave my house to work, as a delivery driver which pays shit, most mornings I just wake up wishing I was dead and thoughts of wishing I never existed, or to be erased from everyone's memory so I could go. 

I don't know how to socialize, I'm shy, awkward, anxious, I have no energy for anything or really enjoy hobbies that I used to. 

And even though I have no energy or feel like doing anything I still do, at home, with a stationary bike at home though. But when I hit a pretty big mark a month ago I just felt nothing, I woke up sad that day and it didn't make me feel any better. 

And I still play videogames even though I don't enjoy them, they only distract me. 

Shits been bad since highschool, the few friends I had I felt like they only invited me to hang out because I was funny and they could male fun of my appearance. I never hung out 1 on 1 with anyone people would call me awkward. 

I've been trying to learn programming too but in the last year I felt like I did too little, only made 4 projects when I should be putting more time into it. 

I don't feel like fit in either, I'm the total opposite of most people in my country, i don't like going clubbing, the type of music that's played here, like basic culture stuff I dislike

She was oppressed and controlled by her family, not being allowed to have any friends, was starved, and was to be married off to some 40 year old man. When her father and brothers found out she was talking to me, they took her phone away, beat her, broke both her arms and cracked her skull against the wall. I found out from her cousin that she died in hospital. And since there is no law in Iraq against domestic violence and police there don’t deal with family affairs they got away with it. Mentally broke me and I don’t know if I’m ever recover. Then her cousin who was talking to me over text at the time also got found out by the family and they strangled her as well.

18xjlrd,Depression,2024-01-03,Does nagging even help?,"
TLDR: Parents are nagging and making me feel even more overwhelmed than I make myself. Does anyone relate? How have y'all dealt with this, what helps you and what doesn't?

I'm sick of my parents always trying to give me advice and pointing out my problems. I'm an extreme overthinker so I know best all my bad habits and behaviour patterns and I'm my worst critic, it's always annoying and maddening that they feel the need to comment on everything. I also get easily triggered by them constantly knocking my door, the tone and cadence of their voice when nagging, the noise in the house when everyone is home etc.

I have huge mental barriers when it comes to starting and continuing tasks, hence I don't meet deadlines, skip school etc which are almost like a reflex as I can't find an effective way around my mental block. Right now, my resting state is apathy (I do care, but I'm mentally exhausted) so my usual executive dysfunction looks even more like laziness. I stay up late, can't wake up, procrastinate, space out, pick my scalp, skip showers, delay meals or skip if I slept too much, lock my door because I'm used to isolating myself and it's the only way I can have my privacy... 

Which leads to my parents constantly knocking my door, checking on my school assignments, reminding me to eat, telling me what to do - And they get upset when I don't follow their instructions immediately. I get accountability and it's good for keeping me on track sometimes, but most times I'm in a constant low mood and it worsens my anxiety and rumination. My brain doesn't even follow my own will to get the necessary things done day to day, so it feels shitty to have other people try to force my will. I much prefer doing things by my own fucked up schedule (when I feel like it) because it's my only way of having control.

Most of the time it just feels like them taking out their frustrations on me, and expressing their disappointment in me, saying their I-told-you-so's. Especially after they argue with each other or get upset for some other reason during the day, they just spread the negativity to me or instead of self-regulating in healthy ways because they never were taught or learnt (I am truly the product of my upbringing).

However like I said, this doesn't help as I'm already hyper-aware of myself. The only way I can describe the physical and mental impact of my depression is that I'm tired, so my parents take it as a reason to double down on their nagging about my self-destructive behaviour. They are concerned, frustrated that I keep falling back on old habits, it looks to them that I don't want to change for the better, they don't like to leave me alone for too long (I do get worse when I isolate myself too much)... I get it but come on, when can I ever catch a break?

I can't change overnight and it has felt from the start of me finally seeing mental health services (with them as my financial support) as if my treatment is controlled by their own perceptions and goals, not mine as the patient."
18xjekk,Depression,2024-01-03,"every time I cry, I get the urge to kill myself.","I don’t know if this is common, I certainly don’t want it to be, but I think I’d feel better knowing that this isn’t as insane as I feel like it is.

I don’t cry as often as I used to, normally I remain pretty numb, but when I cry my thoughts honestly scare me. I don’t want to bring this up in therapy, but I also don’t want to feel this way anymore."

I now have a new S.O and they are the best. But I'm afraid if I dont talk/text them, they'll leave me to.. Like everyone else. I can't handle the thought of losing them too.. idk what to do anymore, but I don't want to kms because I want to die. I want to kms because of the pain. The thoughts.. All of my horrible hypersexual thoughts. The really nasty ones. Ones that if I say them I would get put in a correctional facility. 
Its killing me and I'm just sitting here and taking it.
I'm a coward because I can't handle my own being. My own body. 
I've suffered as much as all the abuse people in their 40s have suffered. 
I am 14 and suffering.
I am 14 and dying.
I am 14 and a coward.
I am 14 and hypersexual.
I'm 14 and I am going to kill myself.
I am 14."
18xiu1h,Depression,2024-01-03,Struggling to focus &amp; divorce,"I’m struggling to read a book more than 1-3 mins. 

Some background:
I’m going through a divorce which is expected to take another 4-6 months to finalize the separation agreement. I often find myself talking out loud similar to what I’d say to someone else (for example my ex) about any topic that could be on my mind. For example, I might talk about why she should accept my offer as it’s fair etc. 

I’m concerned if this is anxiety, depression, a combination of the two or maybe something else completely such as bipolar disorder. 

I will discuss the same with my family doctor next week but thought of posting it here for feedback and thoughts as it’s concerning me quite a bit"

They are angry about it because they cannot understand that my brain is malfucioned. It seems that the only logical decisions is to end my life. its totally sad that I have reached that status in my life that I do say such things.

18xhxrq,Depression,2024-01-03,The Gumball Machine.,"(Notes: I've been having trouble sleeping a lot lately because I can't ever seem to quiet my mind, so I decided I would try to put it to good use. So I've been doing some creative writing a bit. I wrote this as a way to try and describe how I've been feeling lately. Maybe a few people will relate, so I'm posting on here as well.) 

Imagine if you will, a gumball machine. Close your eyes and picture a memory of one. 

Maybe you are a kid, You're holding your mom's hand at the grocery store. You ask for a gumball. She says reluctantly that ""if you don't act up in the store, maybe she'll buy you one.""
Of course, she knows that you chewing loudly on the gumball in the back of the car will bother her to no end. The popping of the bubble will probably upset her migraine. But the popping of the bubble, the smacking, and chewing sounds she hates will bother her significantly less than you whining for the rest of the day about how she didn't buy you a gumball.
So she reluctantly agrees. Of course, you only think about your side of this story, though. How when you were 8, your mom bought you a gumball.
How that day you blew a bubble the size of your head; and how when it popped, it covered your whole face. Your poor mother, the same one who begrudgingly bought it for you had to spend an hour picking gum out of your hair. Oh, how you bragged about it to your friends at school the next day, who of course didn't believe you. 
Seems like a fallacy that one could even blow a bubble that big, when you are 8. An urban myth.
The Excalibur of 8 year old tales on the playground.

Now imagine for a second a gumball machine filled with broken pieces of glass. Maybe the glass is from another's gumball machine.
Maybe it came from a broken window. Could be broken plates and drinking glasses. Regardless though; Who would fill a gumball machine with broken glass? When I think of a gumball machine, though, this is what I think.
*It isn't inherently a wrong answer.* You could fill a gumball machine with broken glass, but again. Who would? Say a person decided to put in a quarter and turned the rusty handle. The spindel inside cranks and below drops a few pieces of broken glass. You grab your reward and of course the glass pierces your skin. You cut your hands and wonder ""why did I just pay a quarter for this?""
You throw away the broken glass and mumble on about your day, but now your hands hurt. Unbeknownst to you after you walk away, the gumball machine fills more with broken glass. Awaiting for the next person to come along and put in a quarter. 
It would take a special type of person to take out all that glass and replace it with gumballs. Of course, just like the urban myth of the ""bubble the size of my head,"" that too seems like a fallacy. 
It is more likely that many will walk by and see the gumball machine of broken glass and just wonder, ""Why?"" And move on with their days. 
Of course, like the person who fills the gumball machines with gumballs, who filled this one with broken glass?
Was it always there? You can't seem to recall it ever being filled with glass. Somehow, it just appeared, and over the years, somebody filled it. 

You don't intend to be abbrassive, but somehow it's all you know. Maybe you wish you could be filled with anything else, but of course, that would require somebody being willing to help you pull out all the broken glass. You, of course, can't do it on your own, for you'd draw too much blood in the process, which would fill it more. The idea of what happens when it's full terrifies you. So the gumball machine that's filled with broken glass awaits for somebody just curious enough to put in another another quarter."
18xhg5j,Depression,2024-01-03,I'd finally made it out and the worst Christmas of my life has put me right back here.,"I was in such a happy place for quite a while and then in the space of a few weeks its all fallen apart and im at the lowest ive ever felt.

My girlfriend cheated on me twice. Once with an ex and once with a guy she met on a night out.

I was a complete idiot for not breaking it off immediately but I was madly in love with her and because she was the one who came clean to me and said she deeply loved me and wanted to work on it I gave her a second chance (stupid I know now).

Anyway this lasted a couple of weeks and she seemed to be really trying up till just before Xmas when I questioned some of her sketchy behaviour/actions. She had started spending time with a guy she kept referring to as her oldest friend when in reality she'd only ever previously brought him up twice as a childhood crush. She reluctantly told me she had stopped overnight in the same bed (but ""nothing happened"" im assured). I then caught her in a lie about her being on a night out and she called me paranoid (even though it was justified since she was lying) and she then broke up with me in the early hours of Christmas morning by text. When I quickly rang her up to ask her wtf the first thing I heard was that guys voice.

When trying to find some understanding from what the hell had been happening from her the following day she called me every name under the sun, was cruel and nasty and took shots at my self esteem for no reason. I realised I've let her treat me like a doormat.

We met through work and she lives 3 hours drive away so this all had to be done over videocall.

I just don't understand how she'd tricked me into thinking she was this lovely person or how she could treat me like that. I'd never been anything but loving and caring and empathetic with her.

I was then stuck by myself practically alone for a week after Xmas except for some messages from friends and some interactions with family. All the while she is out partying with her friends and other guys. I went a bit mad and drank myself stupid most nights.

The one light at the tunnel was that I have this amazing group of friends who were coming back from visiting family in time for NYE to have a great party.

I then missed this party due to food poisoning from a dodgy kebab I had on the 30th. 

I won't get chance to see many friends for a while now. I'm by myself all alone while she is out drinking and partying every night having the time of her life and I've been left here to rot in this pit.

I've just turned 30 and it's so much harder to meet new people and catch up with friends. Bumble and tinder are awful.

I'm not a religious person but I feel like the universe is out to get me right now and I don't see things getting any better anytime soon.

I don't know what I've done to deserve any of this."
18xhdex,Depression,2024-01-03,Just laying in bed crying again,"Nothing to add, just hating life."
18xhcqa,Depression,2024-01-03,I want to let the intrusive thoughts win,I've been laying here thinking about the fact that everyone is asleep. I've been thinking about whether or not I still have a bottle of antidepressants laying around from the last time I went to therapy to get some. I thought I flushed everything down the toilet the last time I felt like this but I'm not too sure. Just run myself a bath and slip under the water. Finally slip away from here.

18xh2fl,Depression,2024-01-03,Why do I feel nostalgic for the times I was really depressed?,"I have my days still at times, but I think I’ve finally somehow gotten through my depression. I kinda just snapped out of it one day after being extremely depressed for 7 years. I’m not sure what triggered it besides getting older. I woke up one day and it’s like a switch was flipped. I consider myself very very lucky. I wish that would happen for everyone suffering. When people with depression ask me for advice I genuinely have no idea what to say because I did nothing to make anything better, I just continued pushing on in life taking it day by day.

But for some reason I miss it from time to time. The lack of energy or will to move a finger and just rotting away in bed all day. Being numb and blank inside. Not a day going by where I wasn’t thinking about dying and just wishing I would because I was too tired to be a human every single day and wanted to sleep forever. The occasional despair and torment clawing at my ribs from the inside. Not eating for days, sometimes weeks, almost a whole month because it brought me comfort, felt nice, and gave me a physical reason to be empty inside. Being alone with all of this.

It was strangely comforting, like a thick heavy quilt. Or a fluffy raincloud wrapped around my body. I’m not sure why I miss it because at the time I felt like I was in literal hell."
18xh1il,Depression,2024-01-03,I can’t go back,"I can’t go back to my school. My entire friend group hates me. I have nowhere to go. They won’t even explain why. I don’t want to be alone. I don’t want to be separated from my phone. I have a social media/internet addiction (I’m talking 20+ hours of screen time per day on average) and the thought of having to leave my devices is terrifying. If I go back, I’ll have to be alone. I told my mother I was joking when I said it but if she sends me back I might have to consider suicide again because I would genuinely rather die than be there. I’ve been assaulted so many times at school and I see the people who hurt me every single day. She should understand, she’s been assaulted, but it was never by anyone close to her. I was groped on a school trip by a guy in the year below that I see once a week at best. I was abused by my ex friend in my year. How can she make me go back after everything? I’ll do the work at home, I don’t care, I just want to be away from an entire school of people who hate me and put me in danger. Everyone else makes friends so easily but I hate everyone in my school, I know for a fact half my classmates are going to end up as future offenders, and because I live so close to school I feel scared to leave my house sometimes. I don’t know if there’s a way out for me. I don’t know if I’m even going to make it to the end of this month alive. I just want to be free of this all. Dying gets more appealing every day. My best friend is the main thing keeping me here and he lives in another country. If I have to go back to school I’ll kill myself. I feel like my body is giving out because no matter how long I sleep, I feel tired, I barely have an appetite anymore, and every part of me is in constant pain."

I’m currently in my last year of high school and grades and studying seem to be ok but I can’t help to somehow feel lost. Lately I’ve been not so much sad but I definitely haven’t been happy either the normal things that I enjoy in life don’t seem to feel the same way anymore such is as things as hanging out with my mates or even going to watch the football with my old man. And my future doesn’t seem to exit me anymore like it used to. It’s even to the point we’re I’ve started effected people around me snapping at them for no apparent reason whatsoever over just a simple conversation or a task they’ve asked of me and most the time. i just come home from school and lock myself in my room sticking my headphones in listening to music not socialising or nothing and shrug it of and go on about the next day week or month but I can’t help to think that I hate it. I thought about reaching out for help but I feel like there’s more important to be taken care of other than me and that I’d be feeling like I’m being selfish.

18xgs6j,Depression,2024-01-03,Sleepless thoughts,"Throughout the day I have a lot of highs and I don't notice my stress, anxiety or sadness. It really hits me when I'm laying in bed and the world is quiet. I put on my head phones to drown out the quietness. As I lay here my mind beginning going on an endless loop of thoughts I don't want to have. Why am I depressed ? Why am I stressed ? Why am I anxious? I'm depressed cause I don't feel like I'm living life with purpose that I'm just going through the day to day and I'm just surviving. It's like I wake up and just do what I have to do in order to get to the next day so I can do it endlessly. Why am I stressed ? I feel like I have so much to accomplish but I don't even know what I want to accomplish anymore. I set these goals for myself and I achieve them and then I'm left without anything. I try to fill my day with so many things to feel like I'm doing something productive but at the end of the day I'm always left with the question of what did I actually do ? Why am I anxious ? I guess this ties into my stress, I don't feel like I'm good enough for myself. I do all the things and I should be proud that I'm doing them but they don't ever feel enough. I could save the world and I'd feel like it wasn't enough. When I feel these emotions, I feel like I'm being crushed, I can't breathe, my heart begins to race and I begin to wonder what am I actually doing with my life. I hate that I have these thoughts cause I know I've done so much with my life. I've beaten generational toxicity. I'm the first to graduate high school , first to go to college , first to serve in the military . I am financial stable, I have a great credit score, I have everything I've ever wanted and more. I'm healthy, physically fit and have friends. I'm literally the black golden sheep of my family. All my younger family members look up to me and talk to me about everything in their life and go to me for all and any advice. I'm the person who I needed when I was growing up and to them I'm who they need. I just don't understand why I feel the way I do. It's beginning to make me turn into someone I never wanted to be. I'm starting to see the world as this ugly disgusting place, I don't want to interact with people anymore, I just stay in my room unless I'm working out or know if I do something it'll make someone else happy. I'm starting to push people away or purposefully saying things I know will hurt them so they leave me alone. I told them all that I'm going through a lot and I don't actually dislike them. I'm tired but I can't sleep. I lay awake at night and end up falling asleep for 4 hour and waking up and repeating it all daily. I just want to see the light at the end of this tunnel. I just want to be happy."

that doesn’t even get me started on gym and lunch, these classes have been my bane since day 1, sophomore year had came back from covid tried re connecting with an old friend and then he called me grotesque and that i was weird and no one likes me and how everyone who did like me was weird, (saw one of my “friends” with him and the friend that funneled him info) lunch didn’t have many friends in either, junior year had the same “friend” in gym class and not mr popular so cant really go with others

 junior year lunch is what i have ptsd over, that shit was the worst thing i put my self through on a daily basis ever. to set the story later sophomore year i had inevitably became “cool” with the group that went against me, however the group was so large of stoners the only people with a vendetta against me was those two and i assumed they dropped it as petty high school bullshit but nope got kicked out by that same bullshit person. luckily i had a friend that i played games with to sit with, this kid is the most popular in the school, d1 offers, has it all and wants to talk to me, but anyways he invited me to sit at his table and it was probably a pity move. Entire table was 7-8 kids i heard in passing through stories or something. now i wasn’t the most popular person but not one person tried to talk to me as a person outside my one friend everyone else was for some form of entertainment, so it was either shut up all lunch and feel like a lost or  get poked at for 30 seconds and feel like shit.

this year has to be the weirdest. now before this year (senior) i was 250lbs sophomore year. I dropped down to 160 in september, and the people treat me better but it’s not the end all be all that they think. anyways lunch this year is everyone other day at the same table with people i somewhat know with a close friend sitting every other day. its like losing the weight made me more of a target for teasing by these two kids, it makes me feel like im under a microscope and that everything i do will affect what little standing i have with them and ruin my image in their head.

i didnt even talk about gym i have it with no friends and one like semi friends. not the most athletic fucked up a few times in kickball and hesrd this group of three people saying “he can’t kick can’t run can’t catch what can he do” about me. like what am i supposed to do look weird and confront him, get in a meaningless fight senior year? i just walked by and didn’t say shit like a coward.


i just hate the way that place makes me feel, what’s wrong with me that people don’t like, it shouldn’t be this way i didn’t want this my life feels over and i’m not a legal adult yet. skipping makes me feel like a 5 year old in a bad way but god i don’t wanna go"

A new depressive episode started when I moved out when i was 19YO to another city, alone. i had no friends nor family member in the city. It was too dark for a teen to handle, i managed by cutting and focusing on my work. my family never cared about me anyway but deep down i always worked too hard to prove to them that i deserve their love yet never got any. 

I started to see a psychiatric few years later, diagnosed with major depression, bipolar and most recently borderline personality disorder + ADHD. it was tough to go through all of this literally alone with no friends or family to share my struggles with. 

my family only asked me for proof of life once in a while and my brothers and sisters asked me for money often because im the only one who works. my dad recently retired. i used to give them, i gave my sister my car which i paid for with my own money. 

my dad asked me to take a loan worth half a million when i first started my job and i was still on probation, it shuttered me that he reached out not to congratulate me but to ask me for money. 

last month, i decided to cut ties with all of them including my brothers and sisters. no one cares anyway but i thought maybe they would for once reach out out of empathy at least. i sound pathetic i know but in a society which values family a lot, i have none. 

its so hard for me to socialize, my mental illness affects my social abilities. all what i have is reading and hoping to die asap or else i will do it next year and end my life for real"

I have so many regrets and I hate myself. I've been depressed for most of my life. Now I kind of just feel done, life has no meaning. I have cancer too and I kinda don't even want to treat it.

18xf736,Depression,2024-01-03,grief or loneliness? this is so embarrassing but,"
this year ive lost my family, lost my house, lost my pets, lost my job, and it just feels like so fucking much to loose in a year. right now i feel the lowest i ever have. i dont know what to do. a walk isnt helping, journaling isnt helping, nothing is making this pain less severe.
i just dont know how to deal with all of this. i am no contact with my family and staying with my partner right now, but i feel homeless. like having your home stripped from you-being forced to leave is so... i dont have a word for it but it feels like being naked and cold and slightly wet and uncomfortable but its a mental feeling. its also a physical feeling i can feel it in my chest. 
when i look up what to do with unbearable loneliness or grief it says to play with your pet, but ive also lost all three of my cats. one passed away from kidney issues and this was devastating because he was my soulmate in a cat. the other two we have, we are trying to find a foster for right now but theres 3000 people ahead of us in line in my state on several different websites and shelters and i fear that very soon we will just have to adopt them out because what else am i supposed to do? theyre at my old apartment until i cant find something to do with them... the one that im being evicted from. i feel like my next breath is on a time crunch. im am so fucking tired.
i just want to talk to my mom orr my therapist or something but my therapist stopped reaching out to me (sounds about right its free from the state because i have a severe mental illness and state provided therapy is actually useless) and going no contact with my family was the best choice but the hole that sits in me 24/7 is never filled and absolutely yearns for a mother who loves and a father who is gentle. 
sometimes it just gets to be too much and i dont know what to do.

i want to go back to the old house (a house that truly never existed)"
18xf6rc,Depression,2024-01-03,I feel so lost.,"I am 32 and the most depressed I have ever been in my life. I am trying to get divorced, but I have to wait until around April or May, and I don’t know what to do after getting divorced. I live in Okinawa; I was a Marine and met my wife here, so I stayed here. We have been together for 6 years and have a 2-month year old together. I am waiting until around April because then I can apply for permanent residency and stay here even after being divorced but the problem is she will try to keep my daughter and never let me see her again, I know because she has threatened to do so. I don’t want to go to America and never see my daughter again and I don’t want to take my daughter and never let her see her again. Even so I do not where to live since I give her 90% of my paycheck for bills and the family. I only play my video game and watch my daughter since she does not go to daycare and I am still wrong. I provide the most money for the family and gladly give it, but I am still the bad guy and every single thing I do is wrong. She is always calling me names and disrespecting me. I just took her, her daughter, our daughter and myself to a nice fancy dinner for new years and the next morning her sister calls my phone and I give it to her and after they hang up, she is on my phone looking through it even though she knows I don’t want her on it because she will get mad about the simplest things. I had to change my phone password, so she stopped getting on it. I’m not allowed to have any friends. She gets mad when I talk to people, I have been friends with for over 10 years. She will see that I added someone new on my FB and ask me 100 questions about who that person is even if it is a guy! I was taking anti-depressants and did not tell her until I finally got fed up with her questions and months later told her it was for the first time it was for depression and that I was very depressed. Her response was “Oh that’s nice, I wish I could take some pills”. Just everything is wrong. I am one of the nicest people in the world, but I am in the worst position in my life. I just want to be happy and have a happy family. I’m sorry if this post is all over the place.. "

18xeygu,Depression,2024-01-03,Relapsing,"Been awhile since I've posted here. 

I was doing fine. I moved, started a new life, got into a relationship. Everything is good and I was happy. I was well enough to get off medication, I finally got diagnosed with ADHD and it made my depression go away. 

But these few days, I don't know but I feel sad for no reason. It's like how I felt before. 

It could've started when my partners brother told me I can d*e in their house (there's a chandelier in my partners room) because right after he told me that, I started having thoughts. 

He doesn't know that I had survived attempts. But he said it as a  ""joke"". I am unsure if he could be the cause of it, or that my depression is coming back for no reason."
18xeya9,Depression,2024-01-03,"In three-year long depressive episode, with no access to support","I've (30s) been in this same depressive ""episode"" I guess, since 2020. Before that, I would only get episodes for several months at a time but having access to friends and other means of support would gradually pull me out of them.

In 2020, an abusive parent did something that jeopardized my ability to live in the country I grew up in. I spent my whole life there so all my resources were there, and I was doing decently until then. I no longer felt safe living there while associated with her, so I had to leave - I got a job overseas for a year, but was also overworked to the point where my health was at risk, and given that I don't meet the requirements to live and work in the country I call home (honestly, fuck this whole system), I had to go to the country I have citizenship in but have never lived in before and don't know how anything works. And here, I've been struggling to find work, struggling to find a way out, and it feels like I'm drowning in quicksand. Needless to say, my mental health has deteriorated in the 10 months I've been here. After three years of ongoing trauma (and retraumatization) and not being able to access support or resources, not to mention not being able to meet my own needs for survival... I've been in a dark place.

I'm struggling to answer my friends when they ask how I am because... that's a lot to put on them and I can't sugarcoat how I'm doing either when all I want to do is end it all because that's the only solution I can see right now. Friends want to help but realistically I don't know how they can, especially given I'm in another country.

Three years of ongoing depression and trauma is a lot. I feel it's altered the way my brain works and also the way my body works. I've been feeling so incredibly weak, and the fact that I can only afford one meal most days definitely contributes to it (been this way for months). I don't really feel safe going out so I stay inside most of the time. I've been missing my life and the person that I was who, despite depression, managed to survive and build relationships and do things they enjoy. That I can't do right now, that I haven't been able to do for the last three years because I've been fighting to survive and I'm running on empty right now. I'm exhausted just going to buy food or taking a shower.

Has anyone experienced prolonged depressive episodes in similar circumstances? How do you manage to take care of yourself? How do you make it out of this?"
190bz4l,Depression,2024-01-06,I have absolutely nobody.,"Normally I don't ever talk about myself online but here we go. I'll type everything thats going through my mind without any filters and in no particular order.

I am a 20 year old male, nevermind a girlfriend, I never even flirted with someone. I am unironically scared of woman because I have been accused of being a pervert by my female classmates, 17/21 of them before puberty. Long story short, they lied because they didn't like me, after 12 years one of them came up to me and apologized. I see these happy couples online and irl; believe me, I do want to be loved and love back, but when I look at any woman I feel nothing. I seriously can not understand the concept of ""Love at first sight"", how people start flirting, how people manage to fall in love. Even if I could overcome these fears, I think the answer would be a ""Eww"".

If we pass from relationships to friendships; Do I have friends? Yes. Can I talk to them when I have a problem? No. Do they ever invite me to anywhere despite talking about where to go and what to do right in front of me? No. Even if Im in a ""friend group"" at an event or somehow, do I feel like I'm not actually a part of that group and more like I am tailing them? Yes. I really do not understand why though, I generally smile and laugh a lot, joke a lot, make everyone laugh in the group, never have any fight with everyone, but it is this way.

Everysingle day I just rot in my room, alone, nobody would hear or care over my dead body. I saw some posts like ""I don't want to kms, I just want to stop existing."", I disagree with those, I really want to kms because I hate my face, my head, my body, my mind, everything about it. When I look at myself in the mirror I see a disgusting animal that I want dead. Because this animal; is ugly, failed as a student, failed as a son, failed as everything, worthless idiot. 

I'll keep the talk about my Family short, they are awful, I'm the middle child of 3, I got beat up regularly by both my older brother and my dad, I went to school with bruises etc. on my face regularly and lied about it to people asking. I honestly wouldn't care if any of my family members died, I wouldn't even attend their funeral.

I am studying dentistry right now, my dad is a doctor, my mother is a doctor, my older brother is a doctor and they all graduated from the same university, I wanted to be a doctor aswell from that university aswell, but failed. So I was the first failure of my family aswell. Upon this, I heard sentences like ""I wish X was my daughter instead of you"" ""You aren't even worth the food I am buying you."" etc.

Everyday, about 12-13 times (I counted once because I wondered how many times I was thinking about it) I think of ending it all. I don't know why I haven't yet, but I think this is it. I have no hope."
18xexb9,Depression,2024-01-03,Please God help me!,"Even though i grew up in a catholic family I have never been religious. I haven't been to church in 9 years. But I'm in so deep in my depression it hurts to live. I have a great and supportive family, I have a great career, I have 2 daughters (8 &amp; 1), different mums and I'm separated from both. My 8 year old lives 6 hours away and I only see her on school holidays. My 1 year lives with my ex and I only see her a couple times a week. I hate that I don't live with any of my daughters. I separated with her mum 5 months ago and I'm still heartbroken from that. We used to live close by to my 8 year old but when we broke up my ex moved back to our home town. So I had to rent my house out and move back with my mum and i'm 30 years old. I am trying to keep moving and be strong for my daughter's. But I don't find happiness in anything, my anxiety is getting really bad and I feel so lonely. I feel like a failure, a shit person, a shit father, a shit son, a shit brother, just a shit human being. I'm think about suicide everyday, throughout the day and my method is easily accessible through my job. I'm in so much pain that I'm desperate for help."
18xeuvy,Depression,2024-01-03,I miss when life was easy,"I miss when I had hope and some element of happiness. I didn't even realize it. Back when I'd come home from playing outside or going to school, hop on YouTube and watch Mario plushy videos. Or maybe I'd check out some random GTA mythbusting video. Everything was new, interesting, and cool. I had the best time of my life playing video games after school with friends online and by myself.

It was all SO simple. No adult responsibilities. Now, I have to deal with mental illness, high stress, work, family, and struggle. I cook for myself, clean things myself, take care of my cat, and pay like 10 different bills. All while being on the spectrum, depressed, and socially phobic. Needless to say, my life is very painful now."
18y3bkz,Depression,2024-01-04,is that a depression?? please help me,"About two weeks ago, I lost passion for everything, my family, friends, studying, and even my girlfriend. I lost all feelings for everything. I feel as if I am insensitive and empty inside. I did not feel sad or happy, if anything, literally. (The first time this situation happened to me.) The day my brother died, I literally had the exact same feeling. I don’t know what to do or how to go back to how I was and feel everything again."
18xeir0,Depression,2024-01-03,Lost everything,"Life defeated me. I was madly in love with someone it was an online long distance relationship but still I loved her with all my heart. Many people say it wouldn't be painful and that it was just online. The way she made me feel I never got it and I'll never have it. 10 months... she was with me for 10 months. When she was with me I had everything coming to me.... every sort of happiness. I passed the exams even though I didn't performed good, my parents bought me a gaming laptop all of a sudden which I wanted since childhood, I got placed into a job easily being the first one in my department to get placed. After 10 months, she made herself distant from me. Only after a month later she told me that she met an old friend and is in love with him. I tried to convince her to stay for a month but didn't worked it. That shit broke me already and during that my training was going on. I couldn't concentrate properly but slowly I kept my shit together and did good. I had the semesters in my college last month, I tried but I couldn't focus on it properly and I did average and poor in some subjects. I don't know if I'll get away from arrears. I finally started hanging out and tried to keep my mind off her. I did my interview after the training just to get rejected. I knew I didn't did good right away but I tried. I really gave my best and failed. Everything's snatched away from me. From the job, I was dreaming about buying a 400cc bike, my parents were thinking about paying the loans. Everything's gone now. I lost everything...
My life sucks!"
18xegyx,Depression,2024-01-03,Depression due to chronic discomfort in testicle after orchiopexy,"I got testicular torsion in January 2021 , right testicle removed and left testicle is fixed with permanent stitches.

3 point non absorbable sutures.
After surgery I felt there is something wrong.
So 3 month after surgery I went to my urologist again.
He tells me that sutures take 6 months to recover.
So after 6 months again went to urologist for uncomfortable in remaining left testicle due to non absorbable sutures.

Doctor again ignores me.

After 1 year I again go to my urologist related to my complaint.
He said it's all psychological.
But I said I feel so much discomfort in stitches of remaining left testicle.
I can't even walk due to this discomfort.
Last year I got varicocele grade 1 in remaining left testicle.
But doctor said it does not cause this level of discomfort.
Even I having discomfort just after the orchiopexy surgery.


Then I go to more than 5 urologist.
Everyone said it's psychological.

But it's not..not.not.
I am feeling discomfort it's no joke.
It's been 3 years.

It's all due to permanent stitches which I can feel by touching testicle.
I am telling them but they are Not  believing in me.


This is my point.But the problem may be something else.
May be I having cpps which causing discomfort..

Due to this pain I tried suicide attempt many times.

Pain makes me cry everyday 

Any suggestions for my problem.

190dogx,Depression,2024-01-06,I think I have depression? What now?,"I've been struggling on and off the past few years with what I think might be depression. I really starting noticing it during the pandemic, when I was isolated in my apartment with only my pet to keep my company and spending my days stressed to the max working in a hospital. I was noticing all the ""typical"" signs of depression and then I began having ?panic attacks on the way to and from work and lots of intrusive thoughts about ending my own life.  Took a new job thinking that might help, but the new job was in a different city.  Things got even worse. My mental health was at an all time low. Ended up calling a help line a couple times and got into a 6 week emergency therapy through my Employee Assistance Program at work.  Also tried seeing a therapist on my own dime, but it quickly became too expensive and I felt as though I wasn't getting much out of therapy.  I've been searching for a family doctor since moving 2 years ago since I also have another health issue that I should be followed for, without any success. 

I'm back to feeling ""down"". Its impossible to get out of bed. I've called out of work way too often. Eating is a chore. I feel like I'm living in a fog. Like I'm being weighed down, or trying to move through molasses. Everything just takes way too much energy. The move has made my financial situation worse. I still have yet to find new friends in the city. And my thoughts seem to spiral. So many intrusive thoughts of self-harm or taking my own life. I'm afraid to be alone with my own thoughts. I don't know where to start with getting help.

18xe66q,Depression,2024-01-03,How to tell my family I’m fairly certain I’m depressed,"For months now, I think since Septemberish, I’ve been going to rough a pretty deep depression. I’ve done self harm, and have considered suicide on several occasions. This has been caused by loneliness and bullying. For example, yesterday I almost made a friend, we had a bunch of the same interests, and we were getting along real well. At one point they said “they started going crazy when they started cutting.” We were talking about a game at the time and that was probably what they were referring to, even if you can’t cut in the game, I told them I had cut myself once before too, and that I now had to go eat dinner. They blocked me after that, and I broke down. I don’t know why but after that I spammed their messages asking to just talk about it, saying that I thought they meant something else when they said cutting. Eventually I stopped, but I cried myself to sleep because of it. I still don’t know why it sucked that much that time specifically. Anyways back on topic, I have yet to tell my family or anyone I know that I’ve been going through some stuff for a couple months now, because I’m scared that I’m overreacting. Like what if we go to a doctor, and I find out I’m not depressed, my parents will think I’m weird, or at least I will. I want to talk to a therapist, but again, what if I’m just sad, and we talk about nothing at the sessions, and my parents just waste their money!? All this ads up to me asking how to ask my parents to talk to someone? Like see a psychiatrist."

Im so very happy for my partners best friend but at the same time I feel terrible about myself yet another job thats passed me by and I stay at Walmart of all places. I want to change my thinking to be less negative but every time I think about how I fail at every turn Im so hoping to succeed or have an opportunity I feel broken and worthless. My partner recently expressed how she hates this part of me- my inability to be positive. I am 26 and shes 23, I try to be positive and happy but when you’re barely making money at a place where theres almost no critical thinking from your peers the job runs you down and my intestinal diseases make it difficult to attend the job in general, so the feelings of worthlessness are so high because if you aren’t successful or making good money in the eyes of capitalism you aren’t worth anything. I used to have a therapist but I cant afford one now with my own insurance, my father barely speaks to me and hasnt said I love you in years, my mother is either trying to help almost too much or cussing me out for being a failure and claiming she will repo my car or home. I am feeling so worthless and if I even say I ignore your job now because hearing you and all your friends work together makes me sad she gets slightly bummed when I dont mean it towards her. I guess just any advice on how to not hate yourself constantly."

It was kind of funny to win the award for having such a good Spirit but it made me realize that people around me have no clue that I am struggling and that I am able to still do a lot of things at work while feeling brainless (although I'd say the actual work that I do is suffering, it's not at the level it used to be due to lack of focus).

as someone who has severe alcohol use disorder, I've started drinking again. It's been years and multiple treatment attempts. I've been asked to go to treatment again, despite trying to get better on my own.

I keep getting asked why I do it. Why do I drink even though the chaos in my life has subsided? Why when things are going okay?

I finally realized the answer. I do not believe I deserve a happy and content life. I am slowly trying to kill myself because I do not believe I deserve to live.

I have been asked multiple times recently what I am doing with my life. I am in my early 30s with a birthday coming up. I have been asked what I've done with it-- what I am doing with it. 

I am trying to survive. That is not an answer I am happy with. What others are happy with. I want to thrive and to live. I just haven't been able to.

I know what I have to do to combat my depression (drinking problem aside). I just can't bring myself to do it.

Does anyone else feel the same?"
18wwke7,Depression,2024-01-02,I wonder what I'm doing here.,"I'm here because I think I've been the lowest I've been in 10 years. 

One thing set me off: being too complacent, a tattletale, and eventually losing a friend. The latter of which was my fault.

But from then on, I've just been on a downward spiral. I don't even know myself anymore.

11 years ago, I was on a tangent about how I felt like I wouldn't live much longer. I didn't have any actual suicidal tendencies or plans, just that I'm dwelling and dwelling on the things that make me imperfect or flawed or not right. 

The people I spoke with for advice say that it's fine and not to think about it. 

I'm worried that I worried someone because I couldn't keep it together. 

I'm actually feeling lonely and depressed. The first time I've ever been in 10-11 years and I'm afraid. 

I've been physically sick for about 3 days. But I've been mentally incapacitated for over a week, crying in a corner, trying not to show. 

Sometimes, I think, I just feel so numb. 

It's a fog and then again I'm afraid. I wish I stayed away. Away from people, from making friends.

I started thinking that maybe the newfound friends I've made in 10 years was a mistake. Maybe they don't know me well enough to be disgusted. 

Maybe the people who avoided me in college, in highschool were right. 

Whether it's ADHD or something else, I've always known there was something wrong about me. And I'm scared to be found out. 

People say I'm smart and capable, but what does that matter? 

What am I doing here? I just want to say things I've never said to anyone. I just want to hold on to whatever form of sanity and reason there is left in me. And think. 

I caught the flu. Glad to hear none of the friends I've been around seems to have caught it. I think i had allergies but that coupled with a low mental state has caused my immune system to weaken. 

I'm glad I'm no longer waking up from crying. 

I deserve to cry though. I deserve to suffer. 

Putting myself in someone else's shoes, if I'd have known what they've heard or thought. 6 weeks they've been indifferent to me and I didn't notice. Chucked it up to ""you're busy, I get it."" 

Totally oblivious to the fact that other people were talking too. And I've become one of them. 

Yea, what was wrong with me? 

How can i even see a therapist with everything that i want to say but can't? 

I'm the worst person i know. I'm dying inside, aren't i?"
18wtatz,Depression,2024-01-02,How do you make yourself eat?,"I haven’t been eating very much lately because I’ve been in such a weird/bad spot. I know that eating more is one huge thing I can do to make myself feel better, but I just can’t make myself do it. Like it feels like I’m really full all the time, like if I eat I’ll get sick. What have you tried to wean yourself back into eating?"
18xduc9,Depression,2024-01-03,"Journaling, day one","Today I’ve been feeling really anxious, and I think it’s partially because of all the feelings I’ve been feeling as of late. I was given a long break from work, and today was my day back, but I’m not really sure how to describe it. Maybe it was because the one coworker I think of as a good friend didn’t really interact with me like she usually would, things felt kind of distant. She laughed and talked with the rest though? Maybe I’m just overthinking it. 

After work, I hung out with my mom and her husband and his daughter, and I’m not sure whether I should have gone at all. I’m not close with my mom’s husband at all, there was just never a connection, but I’m responsible for that. I never showed interest in having a connection with him when I was younger, and I distanced myself from him because of both anxiety and stubbornness and other reasons. 

I think what’s been hardest for me to grasp is that my mom and I’s connection is not the same. She’s always been my bestest friend, we would do a lot of things together, but now her and her husband are attached at the hip. If she decides to sit with me, she’s then encouraged to sit beside him instead. I’ve noted that he’s very clingy, and can get jealous about stuff like that. Basically, hanging out with them, I always feel like a third or fourth wheel. But I’m 19 now, It’s not like I’m a child, and I’m happy for her happiness with him.. as a woman that got out of a very toxic relationship with my cheating dad. 

Once I got home, I slept and then cried for a bit. I think the thing that finally pushed me over was someone telling me (online) that my voice pissed them off, and that I should just shut up. It feels like the deterioration of my mental health is getting worse day by day, and I’ve started to contemplate suicide more often. I try not to think about it, to remind myself that it gets worse before it gets better, and that it isn’t worth it. But everyday, my mind runs right back to the thought, and it’s terrifying.."

I got fired from my job a few months ago, started a new one, became pregnant, and been working long hours.   I'm not getting along with my coworker and I fought with the baby daddy today and well, I'm so stressed I can't breathe or think properly .  

I know it's my fault as the baby daddy says, I just need to fix myself, I'm just fighting with him because I'm bored and don't take responsibility.  And the coworker talks behind my back in Spanish, complains I don't communicate and that it's an issue . 

I tried my usual hobbies which I find pleasurable, such as reading or going on a long drive but I feel like a balloon deflated.  Nothing brings me joy.  I tried crocheting but couldn't focus long enough .

18xqwjn,Depression,2024-01-03,"struggling with hypersomnia, any tips that helped you?","pretty much what the title states. I'm sleeping 14-18 hours a day because I'm so depressed I just don't get out of bed. I don't really wake up either, I just sleep. My body is so used to this schedule that I'm heavily tired when I try to sleep less. It's messing up my diet since I wake up so late I just cook wathever I have at home and skip most meals. I don't want to be negative because I truly want to get out of this and hope I do sometime soon, but life's hit me hard lately and there's nothing I feel like doing anymore. I go to a therapist and have been on antidepressants for 5 years now.

Have any of you tried melatonin? I know it sometimes helps falling asleep, but I don't know if it'll help me sleep less? maybe in a way where I feel truly rested.


Any other tips are welcomed, I don't know what can help me."

18x77h2,Depression,2024-01-03,Hello.,"Hello, I am a 15-year-old girl who has been diagnosed with depression, social anxiety, and Anger issues, it's the perfect mix for a 15-year-old who used to be picked on in middle school... Anyway, let's move on to what's bothering me, Ever since I was enlisted into a mental hospital for about a month because I did some “dumb shit” those are my words, not anyone else I am about to mention. 

Moving on... I voluntarily went there after something had happened early in the morning, I didn't want to go to school... I didn't have the energy and I hated my new school, the air, and the kids made me extremely anxious. Everyone around me was either hitting a vape or popping a tic tac... I'm so serious, I caught someone hit a vape in the middle of class..- but that isn't important. That day I was feeling rather exhausted.. (It all happened on Oct 5 but I don't know what day it was, just the date. ) I was mentally tired as usual like any other day, when I wake up I sometimes don't get out of bed immediately, and that used to be something my mom hated about me... I wouldn't get up til everyone else had gone in the bathroom because I felt like I needed more energy. 

(before I continue I want to give you some facts about my mom. My mother suffers from breast cancer and she is really patient with me, I believe she was diagnosed somewhere around 2019-2020) 

That day I think my mom was annoyed by the fact that wouldn't get up after everyone had finished using the bathroom and I was still in bed. My mom ended up throwing stuff that was on my Drawer/Desser onto the floor in one swing. Which I didn't expect since she always complained about her body being heavy... Though back then I was just too exhausted that I ended up cursing her out and telling her to get the f* out of my room. My stepdad heard me from downstairs and came running upstairs... Looking back I find that part funny how he didn't run upstairs when he heard the London Bridge crashing... But honestly, I'm not surprised. We didn't have a very good relationship anyway... And I'm sure he was aware of the fact as much as I was.

Anyways let me continue. He started to yell at me and call me shit like Fatass, little shit. You know... and I'm very insecure about my weight to this day so I replied... With “Shut your bitch-ass up, you can't be saying that shit when you're a deadbeat dad and you didn't finish the 7th grade.” I guess it was true because he went off. 😂

My mom started to defend me, but then I was angry with her too. I went into my mom's room and started to rummage through her pill bag looking for my anxiety pills... She got them before I got them and when I told her to give me them, she didn't. So... Being a 14-year-old teenage girl then... I went downstairs, opened the knife drawer, and held it against my neck. I started to threaten her with the fact that I would slit my throat right in front if she didn't give me them. 


(reading this part makes me think that my life is a movie and I'm nothing but an antagonist in someone else's world. )😂

I'm so unmotivated that I don't even wanna type it all out. I broke down and my stepdad took the knife from me, I went upstairs locked myself in my room, and started to choke myself with a wire, until my mom unlocked my door with a key and told me to get dressed. 😂😂🙏 

I did exactly that and we left! MENTAL HOSPITAL HERE I COME!! yeah anyway, I was enlisted in a mental hospital for a month.😂😂😂🙏 I'm adding laughing emojis but I'm crying right now. 


Let's time-skip to now and I'm going to make this brief. 
I go to a sped school now😂😂🙏 and I have a therapist that I don't talk to about my feelings because humans make me uncomfortable 😂😂🙏 

I'm supposed to be taking my braids out but I'm not. I'm writing this bullshit😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂

And I want to die.😂😂 someone pls send me some Barbiturates /j I want to die. /j 🙏😂😂😂😂🙏🙏 I'm so serious!/srs 🙏😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂"
18xdnzb,Depression,2024-01-03,"Ex fwb destroyed me mentally, cant stop thinking about them","M22 -  I have written this post about 3 times now and keep resetting it so here's The third time. I feel like my relationships always crumble. I used to have a friends with benefits relationship with a girl in college that I knew for about 3 years and we were together for about 6 monthshe had a boyfriend a year befoe. I asked her out on a date and then I confessed that I really liked her and she said let's be friends with benefits because she wasn't ready for a relationship. I thought that we would eventually become boyfriend and girlfriend but I was sadly mistaken. after a while I lost feelings for her because when we went to get free theme park tickets she left me for 2 random people she met at the event. After this I resented her quite heavily and we took a break for about 2 months but before the break she was being very distant because I was putting so much into the relationship and she didn't want that much effort and put into it. She asked if I wanted to end the friends of benefits if I couldn't handle it but I kept going with it because I thought that she would love me. Eventually near the end post nut clarity kicked in and I could I thought that I didn't love her anymore so why be with somebody if you don't love them enough to possibly risk having a pregnancy. I'd eventually tried to make Amend's multiple times but cancel each time because I couldn't handle it and eventually I blocked her because I could not stop thinking about her at all times and needed to remove her from my  Sight line. Fast forward a year and now she has blocked me instead and she appears to be with someone else and they seem very happy. I however am stuck trying to find someone that actually loves me and every relationship I attempt to get into I am ghosted without a response. When I was with my friends and benefits everything felt comfortable and nice to have that intimate connection with but she didn't love me and  We didn't connect. I still think about her all the time though almost daily because of how I feel I hurt her in the end by not waiting for her or not taking her feelings into account when it felt like she didn't have any feelings towards me or she didn't care to cherish me the way I wanted to be cherished. Maybe it was selfish to put myself first but the head space that I was in because of this relationship destroyed me I couldn't think of anything else it was only about her and I couldn't think of myself at all in this relationship. But thinking about how happy she is now breaks my heart because I cared so much about her. Maybe that's just the kind of person she is  To ditch me for random people that she just met 20 minutes ago. I'm still struggling to find some sort of intimate Connection with someone because of these insecurities that I have that are preventing me from opening up to someone or Something Else that could be deeper rooted. I just wanted to get other people's thoughts on this because I don't feel like I can be open with people around me, or that people will reject me for this flaw."
18wr8g7,Depression,2024-01-02,Feeling hopeless after depression returned in full force,"So, some history with my battle with depression. Pretty much all my life I've been struggling with it in some way shape or form. My first suicide attempt was back in grade 5 (about 10 y/o). It wasn't until 2017 that I sought help for it and was diagnosed with clinical depression and anxiety after I found out my ex was cheating on me. I was put on various medications through the years until we settled on max dose bupropion and free counselling. This was my treatment until late 2022. My life took an upswing during this time. I got a great job, was making good money, even got out of homelessness. Things were looking great, and my counsellor dismissed me due to being in a better mindset. My prescription ran out and my family doctor denied me a refill (up to this point the counsellor had a doctor prescribe me my medication) as she isn't a fan of medication treatments for depression. I was fine for a bit, but things started to get worse.

During the good times I started to have a loneliness feeling start to grow. I live with my wife and our 3 cats and dog. My wife kinda has an opposite schedule from me, so during her work week I don't see her too much. I kinda have no friends (complicated situation with online friends) and the loneliness from that started to twist in my mind. I was dealing with it, but it was doing some damage. Fast forward to September 2023 and I learned that great job I had was getting cut due to budget cut backs. Since I am the new guy, my job is being cut Q1 2024 (still have it atm). This hurt, like really hurt. I started applying and looking for a new job, but nothing comes close to what this job was providing. As the months went on things got worse and worse for my mental state. I just had 10 days off for the holidays, and during that time my depression consumed me. I wasn't able to have any enjoyment, the holidays didn't even feel like holidays, I thought constantly about work, and suicidal thoughts returned.

I feel like I can never not struggle in life. It's getting to the point where I wonder what is the point of the struggle? If I am always going to struggle, and never be firm on my feet should I even continue? I'm tired, this morning when I was getting ready for work as I've been doing for 14 months, I was miserable. This time last year I was impartial when getting ready for work. I wasn't happy or excited, but I wasn't angry or miserable. It was a means to an end, and I accepted that. Now, I can't even enjoy 10 days off cause I know I have to return to work after them, and now I wonder what is even the point if I will still be struggling. I feel like my job lured me in to thinking I've made it, just to rip it away from me to leave me worse off than prior. Again I feel like if my wife wasn't in my life I may of went for attempt number 4 at just ending it all.

Also, not sure if this is tied to the depression returning, but I have had an increase in nightmares. Pretty much what used to be a rare occurrence, now happens at least once a week and leads to terrible sleep. I've also been getting sick more often. Back in November I had a cold that lasted 3 weeks, just to be better for about a week, then got another cold. Not sure if these have anything to do with my depression kicking things up a notch.

Sorry for the ranty post. I am at work at the moment, and my mind is a mess. Just wanted to pour out my feelings a bit. Calling my doctor on my lunch to attempt to schedule an appointment to get help again."

The baby is now with my partners parents but I don’t want to see him or be in his life. I know that sounds really bad but you don’t know why or how I feel. I feel so useless and used. I want to get rid of my partner but I don’t know how to because my uncle I love lives in a different state and my partner doesn’t talk to his parents so he wouldn’t move back there. I care too much sometimes but because of everything that’s happened in my life I feel like death is the only way out. I don’t like myself at all. I hate myself. I don’t have friends or anything and I’m trying hard to find a job again but no luck. And seeing my partner going out and working makes me jealous and feel left out because I’ve never met any of his friends. I don’t feel loved and grow up in foster care moving home to home so I feel out of place in life. 2022 was such a good year I was modelling and let celebrities but now after isolating I feel so anxious and scared so idk if I could even have that job again.

Everyday is getting hard and I am trying and trying and trying to sleep at night to keep a normal schedule to eat three meals a day but it does not work. Can't explain how I feel because sometimes I feel like it's not valid and sometimes I feel like it doesn't make sense that I just fall apart. I don't understand why this happens to me and I don't understand how to change it. I sit there for hours on end thinking and when I'm working I sit and I think about how I can get better. One of my co-workers I can tell struggles with the same thing because they ask me when I'm not okay they can tell. It pains me that they notice that easily. The last thing I want to do is have someone know what is wrong with me, I hate having people see how broken I feel. I wish there was something I could do without doing something stupid to make myself feel better. I almost lost a friend a couple weeks ago to suicide and if it wasn't for me she wouldn't be here.

18xcncq,Depression,2024-01-03,I’am in a spiral between life and death,"I don't know the direction of my life, everything worries me, I feel like I'm in a vacuum. Sometimes I think about what I will do if one of my relatives dies, but I feel like if one of them dies, I will die too. In primary school, my teachers secretly told my family that I should go to a psychologist. I went to a psychologist many times for reasons like this, for reasons I couldn't understand. I even got therapy once, sometimes I questioned myself, but I was in a great depression. I was living in Turkey 6-7 months ago, but then I moved and now I'm in America. Sometimes I miss my friends, relatives and the old environment I lived in, but I know that my friends here care more about me than my old friends. To be honest. If necessary, I am 14-15 years old and I am going to the 8th grade of secondary school. Sometimes life seems very good, but then all my joy goes away because of stupid things. For example; I know that I kill myself after playing computer games or looking at my phone because I damage my eyesight and wear glasses while doing these. I can't make my own decisions, I ask everything to others, I don't have self-confidence, sometimes I feel like crying in vain. Everything feels fake, no one wants my well-being except my family. In fact, last year when I was in Turkey in the 7th grade, the school garden was empty and school had not started yet, so I was wandering around idly while waiting for my friends and I saw a rope on the ground. I was in deep depression at that time (I was like Ddlc sayori (lol)) I tied the rope to a tree and tried to hang myself. Top 5 The second worked but the rope broke… I'm in love with a guy at school, but he's playing with me, my friends say he's changed me and they're right because I'm stuck to computer games that I don't like because of him, I do it just to get his attention, but sometimes he tells me that he has a girlfriend, but I'm sure it's not real, and by the way, I scratched a lot on my arm last year, they all represented the sadness in my life, sometimes I feel sorry for myself and I say this; what happened to the cute little girl who always smiles, now she's grown up and she's thinking about things like that, but why?"

Ive joked about it and beat around the bush but I hav never truly had a conversation with anyone about what im fighting with every day. now I know this post won't reach anyone and im not looking for anyone to reach out or ask me about my feelings. 

I would say my first sewer slide thought I had would have been my junior year of high school. It would slowly become worse when I found myself in a crisis center in my senior year. I of course lied for every single question they asked me because I wanted to be anywhere else than there and I knew that if I answered their questions correctly, the sooner I could leave. 

I'm now 21 and I can honestly say that I couldn't care less if im living or shooting hoops with Kobe right now. I feel like everything holding me together mentally collapsed two years ago when I watched my s/o die right in front of me. I was meeting them at our neighbors house because our dogs had gotten out and they had them at their place. (they lived 10 miles away)  I was following behind my s/o in my car when I realized that they were driving well over 100 mph and as I was calling them to sow down they missed the corner and was ejected out of the windshield and and rolled over by their suv. I still hear my s/o's father and brother screaming as I was sitting in the passenger seat of the sheriffs truck having a massive anxiety attack. 

ever since then I haven't been happy, sad, angry, or emotional. I just feel empty... I've ended up hurting myself but not physically. With feeling all this emptiness, I've lost every friend that I had, my family rarely talks to me anymore, I can't talk to anyone about anything because nothing interest me and or I just dint want to put the effort in. im sorry, this is an extremely long post and if you've made it this far....

I got stood up by all 3 therapists that told me that ""had availability"" on my first appointment with them SEPERATELY, no calls back, no communication. I need the weekly visits so bad. My friend who has the same insurance told me she's never been able to get a weekly therapist either, and was stuck with a ""temporary one"" that she saw every 3 weeks indefinitely.   


I feel like I'm going insane. I **BADLY** need regular therapy. I just got out of an incredibly harrowing home environment.

I (37f) have been living with mental illness for a very long time. I have been diagnosed with Depression, an anxiety disorder, stress. I also have PTSD and suspected DID. I am on two antidepressant medications too, this will become relevant.

Recently my wife and my roommate moved a significant distance from where we were living. Myself and my wife both drive but our roommate does not so when we moved she had no way of getting to work so had to quit. She tried and struggled to get work, down here. I later find out that the last day at her old job that someone put a gun in her face and tried to rob her.

So for 5 months we paid our roommates bills and rent putting my wife and myself in dire straights financially. My wife works everyday and I have to too just to make ends meet which my roommate who now has a job only works part time.

Because of this and the stress I have not been in a good way and my mental health is through the floor. Unfortunately it has been coming out as frustrations directed at my roommate. This coupled with her experience with the robbery she told us she would be checking inpatient to a crisis center so she could get better. I want her to get better I truly do. I miss my friend and I miss having fun with her.

However I can’t stop feeling the anger. About two years prior I had a breakdown due to a job I couldn’t do any more. I wanted to check in to a facility back then but realized that I have responsibilities. She also has responsibilities too, and I feel like we’re having to pick them up again while she gets therapy. I’m jealous that she gets to get better and I’ve needed to go inpatient for so long. I hate feeling so damn numb all the time, being expected to be everyone’s shoulder to cry on.

I ended up having an self harm session where I slashed my legs about 30 times, I haven’t self harmed since 2007. I am ashamed, I’m guilty and I am angry. I don’t know what to do. Part of me wonders if I should stop taking my psych meds just so I’ll get bad and I can get committed, so it really isn’t my choice because I have to hold everyone and everything together. I just can’t stop feeling like this.

I want my friend to come out a better person but I need to heal too.

TLDR, friend causes significant stress causing me to self harm and wanting to check into a crisis center."
18xcp5n,Depression,2024-01-03,I feel terrible,"I haven’t really felt myself the past couple of days or maybe I just stopped pretending to be ok. I feel very lost and empty. I just want this year to be better. It’s sounds so cliche but I honestly feel dead inside.

18xce7d,Depression,2024-01-03,I only need myself,"I'm beginning to envision a life with just myself. Out in the vast forest or country. Alone. Maybe I would just drink all day. Who knows? But I know now all I need is myself. All I need is myself. And I don't give a shit. I hope society hates me. I hope you all downvote me into oblivion. I hope I'm alone forever. Fuck people. Not you personally, I don't mean that I am better than you or you are worse than me, but I have found the greatest happiness lies being ""spiritually"" independent. I'm not a spiritual or religious person, and I do not believe myself to be better than anyone else. I believe that all humans, yes, ALL humans are just okay. No human is bad or good. Absolutely NO human. Im so done caring about what other people think and comparing my thoughts and feelings to other people's thoughts and feelings. Maybe it's just the alcohol, but I feel so free right now. So inpenitrable. I accept my death, even though I am scared of it. I don't think I will ever be completely unafraid of death, but right now im at peace. I'm 17. I've been depressed since I was 7. I think my parents divorce at age 7 sort of triggered my genetic depression granted from my birth mom and idk what the fuck was wrong with my birth dad, but it was something. I'll tell you that. 10 years of painful life. life in the painful pages. all i need is me. fuck my family. fuck people. but im sure you're actually really nice. nobody is as bad or good as you think they are. everyone's just okay. including me. im just like everybody else. And fuck if i dont realize that yet. fuck if i haven't learned yet."
18xcbm3,Depression,2024-01-03,does severe depression cause hypersalivation (drooling) ?,"For years,when i was a pre-teen/teenager i had severe depression that led to psychomotor retardation,which like makes you slow/kinda like having a light form of mental disability,yk because of brain damage.Basically,i was overwhelmed with anxiety and depression,and it was like i wasnt able to think clearly or at all,i felt retarded in other words. It also affected my movements and muscle control. I noticed also that i developed hypersalivation,I was drooling...I was feeling wet around one of the corners of my mouth and i had to wipe it with my finger,it didnt even show,it was just a constant,daily feeling of wetness.But there were some instances where i would open my mouth to talk and actually drool...that happend thankfully only 3 times,but that was embarassing enough,not in public though...

I still experience that feeling of wetness ,i think that it persisted out of my fear of hypersalivation.Currently,Im still a teenager but unmedicated because my parents dont believe at all that i could possibly have depression,even though i have shown signs and even attempted to kill myself many times,i was even physically and verbally abused for it. My depression has been totally better though.This feels embarrasing to post but i felt the need to.Has anyone else experienced this drooling problem? If so,what did you do to treat it?"

18xc3hj,Depression,2024-01-03,cutting marks,"i discovered cutting when i was 12yo now 28. i dont recall how i did but i was going through a very dark period. 
bullied at school, home and literally everywhere. my mum beating me up constantly while i was pushing myself to prove to her im worthy. i hated myself and wanted to end my suffering by committing. i never felt worthy of living, never, not even now. 
i used to cut myself all the time, deep cuts and sometimes i would faint to find myself still alive. i used to wear long shirts and hoodies to cover my arms yet sometimes they bled through. 
cutting felt like a relief pressure valve, it somehow calmed me to see blood and feel in control, thats the only thing i could do as a child until it became a coping mechanism. 
i feel like i was have the choice to cut to cope. my arm is covered with scars, i worry that people at work or real life might one day report me to the authorities. 
as im writing this, im admiring my arms and wishing for a sharp object/razor to cut to calm my noon demons."

I have checked all the boxes of western civilization's definition of a happy life, and yet... I am less and less excited to do anything as the days go by. As I'm aging, as I see my parents and my family age and deteriorate every year, I feel less and less happy. I'm simply not motivated anymore. The idea of getting a higher and higher paying job and paying bills doesn't really excite me. Honestly, nothing really excite me anymore 

I'm just hoping to create something beautiful before I gracefully off myself in a few years. A beautiful EP, photography, beautiful paintings or artistic expression, or a book or two to describe my state of mind."

I want to cry and let it all out. I lay in bed and the tears never come and I just feel so damn bad about so many things and at the end of the day I’m just so burnt out from faking being okay. I feel so uneasy and like I’ll never be good enough or enough for anything. I’ve been self destructive lately and I’m pushing people away the only way I know how and that’s just overwhelm them and hurt them in ways I know I can. This just makes it worst cause I don’t want to do these things but the thoughts in my head take over. They ask me why I do it. I’m currently fighting one thought non stop and if I lose then it’s game over. Please someone tell me when it actually gets better or changes

I live at home again with my family and I can not see anyway to move out as I know no one to be my roommates and single apartments cost ridiculous amounts of money. I always thought things would just work out cause they have to that's how life has worked up until now but every passing day I realize so many things in my life are not and will never be how I need them to be. I genuinely see no way out. I think about dying a lot and i have thought every day for the last month that I should commit myself to the psych ward but I hear they often make you feel worse than help you feel better. Honestly I think the easiest thing to do is just unalive myself because I see no way of getting help otherwise and finding a way to live a happy life

18xbaiy,Depression,2024-01-03,Disappointing my parents has made me felt suicidal,Ever since I was little I have felt pressure to make my parents proud. I’m 24 and still live with them due to money issues and college. My whole life I have refrained from doing anything that would make them unhappy. I never had a social life. Focused only on school. Competed in multiple competitions and won a few. In 2023 my dad called me lazy and kicked me out of the house. After I worked two years for him in a meat department and worked insane hours while going to school. I have missed opportunities learning because of this. That moment he called me lazy I wanted to kill myself. My biggest fear is failure. I eventually came home because my grandpa was diagnosed with cancer. Ever since then anything I do makes me feel suicidal. If I slightly feel like a loser or a failure I want to die. Today my dad said I can’t do anything right. I attempted to kill myself. I started to cut my wrist. I didn’t go deep enough to actually do anything. I’ve been crying hysterically and my parents don’t care. They think I’m being over dramatic. I honestly think they would be happier without me. Everything I have accomplished is never good enough for them. I got deans list all of college when they thought I wasn’t smart enough for college. I got a job in my field of study that works insane hours. I have given them money when I can. I am not good enough for them. I never will be. I can’t do anything right. I don’t think I’m going to actually kill myself. I’m so afraid of death. But I can’t stand disappointing my parents. I feel like I’ve wasted so much of my life trying to make them happy
190elr0,Depression,2024-01-07,How to stop feeling ashamed and like life is passing me by?,"I'm about to be 21. I'm behind. Not terribly, considering I'm 21, but behind enough that's it's a constant nagging concern at the front of my mind, even though the whole reason I'm behind is because I'm severely depressed and have no motivation to do anything and don't get pleasure from hardly anything.

Don't get me wrong, I'm trying, but it feels like I'm not trying hard enough and I'm always beating myself over the head for it. Bad days become horrible days because now not only am I depressed but I got nothing done today and feel even worse. I know that comparing myself to neurotypicals isn't fair but... how disabled am I? How much of it is just in my head? There are days I feel physically crippled I'm so depressed and yet some part of me keeps saying that it's all in my head and that I need to stop being a pussy and tough it out."
1902gak,Depression,2024-01-06,I keep dreaming of Ex's leaving me so i need to rant,"Im having vivid dreams, and in every single one i keep dreaming of am ex and they either end up cheating on me or ridiculing me. I end up feeling so low and usually i can handle ot but this one i just had took my soul away. It was so real, it felt like an alternate world. She came to me after i had the ability to lucid dream, and at that point when i saw her all i could do was roll with it.

The dream went like this

I was arriving back to my friends house after a jam session. Saw her in the window talking to his family. Decided to try and get back to my house instead since it is down the street. She spots me. Tries to come after me and i tell her to go away.

I then cut somehow to a fancy restaurant, i have been here 3 times in the dream, and this time i have a fancy suit and im talking to the receptionist. Then i feel someone put their arms around my waste and squeeze me tight. I try to ignore it because i know who it is, thinking i can dream ot out of existence but for some reason at that moment i forgot i was dreaming again. The receptionist gets angry with me, i decide to look around me and see my ex again. I tell her to get off me, to go away, that she isnt welcome anymore.

It works, she left. So i go to a seat, across from me are twins and to the side are nice women id want to talk to. (I know this isnt how it works but my dream was weird) i can do mothing but stare at how beautiful these women are, but i do nothing. They are told these arent their seats by a waiter, they leave. The twins im front of me somehow multiply into dozens and fill those seats and only seem to talk with each other.

This is when she appears again, in place of one of the twins. Dont know if she was always there, dont know if she just arrived, but she was there. For some reason i decide to talk with her, mostly about our past but the rest i cant remember. And there is this guy in another suit beside me talking to the twins. He starts talking with her for some reason at this momwnt i feel like a prisoner in my own body. She then starts doing sexual acts with him and when i see it happen the whole restaurant does and they start looking at her and me. I lean on close to her as she is on top of the guy next to me and i tell her ""this is why you are nothing to me"" and i get up an attempt to punch the guy. And i wake up.

I know it was a dream now but it felt so real, and i left put most details but i couldnt remember them. This ex, i dated in highschool for a few months. She did end up cheating on me, not once, not twice, not thrice, but every time she saw someone she couldnt resist herself it seems. I hardly think about her now so i don't know why she suddenly apeared to me in my dream but i tend to dream a lot about my exs now. And i wake up feeling like shit. This takes the cake. I looked her up online and she seems to be doing much netter than me in life. I cant help but judge myself too, judge that i let it get to me so much.

What can i do? What can i learn? Can someone help me out here? I am too lost mentally to really do it myself."
18zqd2s,Depression,2024-01-06,"I told my parents I was depressed, and they told me to pray (I'm an atheist)","I finally gathered up the courage to reach out and tell the people I trust the most (my parents) that I've been suffering from depression for the past few months.

I told them I've never had so many thoughts of killing myself in my life, and they just kind of brushed it over and told me to pray. I'm an atheist, so this was a huge blow to me. It's like they're telling me to pray to the air, and that ""God"" will cure my depression. 

Long story short, sometimes you're better off not telling anyone, because telling people won't make things better."
18y399x,Depression,2024-01-04,No one even likes me,"I'm so sure that my whole fucking life has been cursed. All throughout school I was constantly bullied and picked on online and even when I did not even talk to or bother anyone. I didn't even get an actual friend until high school who I met online and of course I had to ruin the relationship because I asked him if he thought of me the same His and our relationship was very close which I had thought and after a month since I asked him that he continued acting like he liked me in the same way despite him avoiding it every time I asked and so then he found another girl to talk to and ignored me completely which I stopped talking to him since it hurt me too much. I found out later which I assume he has always talked bad about me because his friends literally act like I'm the worst person to ever happen to him. (I literally cried because of him for a month and it took me a whole year to get over him while it only took him a couple of days). 

I do have one person that I consider a friend now but we don't talk very often and I feel like he's gotten a girlfriend since I texted him and it's been like 4 hours and he has not texted me back (he's been online and I know bc he posts on his instagram story). I am so fucking lonely and I hate it. To make matters worse, I texted my dad happy new years (my parents are divorced) and he saw it but didn't wish me one back. My parents relationship is very complicated and well my dad isn't in my life at all. I barely even see him once a year if I'm lucky and he has never even helped my mom out or sent us money.

I can't even make friends if I want to. Not even online and when I do, people just end up finding me annoying or they just talk to me when they have no one else to talk to. I hate my life so much I wish I was another person"
18xb8iq,Depression,2024-01-03,I feel empty,"I am a native french speaker so sorry if my English is not correct

There is a lot of things that i usually love that just doesn't feel the same anymore. I write a lot and i don't know it's just seem pointless, like everything I do someone else does it better or just nothing is really worth it even tho my heart tells me to continue and to pursue my dreams I somehow just abandoned. I have this weird habit to sob once in two month or once a month because It relieves some pressure on my heart. I truly don't know what to do I struggle everyday since i am 16-17 with this and I'm 20 now. I guess i have to talk to someone about this but when i tried it wasn't feeling like it was helping me in any ways. 

Sorry for the chaotic form of my message is my first time here and i don't really master this language ! 

But yeah i really want to know what you guys think, do you have any advice because I'm truly lost, I don't know i should do and I feel that i reached my limit.

18xaov6,Depression,2024-01-03,Idk,"Depression is exhausting. Every moment of the day feels like a daunting task. It's as if you're constantly grappling with your inner demons. You find yourself trapped in a turbulent ocean with no sight of land, struggling to keep your head above water. Each passing second becomes a battle, fighting against the relentless current that threatens to pull you under. Sometimes, you wonder if it might be wiser to surrender, to let the ocean take you, as at least then you might find peace. After all, what's the point of fighting a hurricane when there's no shore in sight? What am I even fighting for? These thoughts tug at my mind, wavering between the futile struggle and the possibility of letting go."
18xal7f,Depression,2024-01-03,"I feel like suicide is my only option, because I feel like I can't succeed under my current conditions in life","I am 22M, and basically my life has been going downhill for a while now, but it really started to all go to shit when my dad died back in March 2022.

For context, I've always been miserable living at home, and while my dad wasn't perfect and had his flaws, it's my mom that is the toxic one. For years I've had to deal with physical, verbal, and emotional abuse from her. Basically, when I graduated high school, I just wanted to get the fuck out of the house and I thought to myself, what is my best option? I thought about going into the military, but I didn't like the mandatory 6 year commitment. I thought about going to a university and staying in a dorm, but with covid and it being expensive, I figured it wasn't a good idea. My dad always wanted me to go to community college for 2 years as he could afford it and then transfer to a university for the last 2 years. I figured, if I can just put up with them (more than anything my mom) for 2 years, then I'll get to go to college and I'll be away from them, which is what I wanted more than anything in the world. Throughout these 2 years at community college, I got good grades, but I was absolutely miserable living at home and having to deal with my mom. 

Fast forward to my dad's death, and life just starts to lose all of its happiness and joy. Having to deal with my dad's death and my mom's behavior has been so stressful. Also, since my dad died, I'm really the only family she has left and now she acts all nice and kind and loving, because I'm ""all she has left"". I ended up going to college, and so far it's been a pretty shitty experience due to my dad's death. I had to commute from home my first semester. My grades are shit and my therapist has diagnosed me with depression. I decided that enough was enough and I dropped out this semester because I couldnt handle it and my mom wasn't happy about it. I've had to deal with so much of her shit since my dad died, including her threatening to kill herself and putting the blame on me and guilt tripping me. 

College has never been a big goal for me, and I only saw it as a way to get away from my mom. I have goals that I want to accomplish in life, but I feel so depressed all the time, I can't even get out of bed. I'm going to start taking antidepressants soon, but I still want something to change in my life. I only have an associates degree. I have no skills in anything for a job, and I don't even know the first thing about being independent and moving out. I feel very lonely all the time and I just can't go through life alone anymore. I want to just get away from everything and start over. I want to disappear somewhere and start a new life. My ultimate fantasy right now is I wish I had a girlfriend that I could move in with and that will take care of me and help me get my life together. I just feel like I need someone to motivate me in life, because I can no longer motivate myself. I have hobbies, interests, goals, but I can't enjoy any of it due to my depression. I just want things to get better but I don't know how. I dont want people to tell me to ""just hang in there"". I don't know what to do to improve my life, which is what frustrates me. If I don't know what to do to improve my situation and if I can't succeed in life or accomplish my goals, and if I'm just gonna be stuck like this, I'd rather just kill myself. Because life isn't worth living like this. I really don't know what to do, and I need advice."

18xaiur,Depression,2024-01-03,trying my best,It's been over a year since I posted on here. My life has been a steady progress with going back college I been doing better than I did when I first started. Work has been going well and got a new car last summer while making new friends along the process. But sometimes I sit in my room think about if I'm worthy of peoples attention or if I am good enough in general. Theres times I think that maybe I'm a disappointment to my parents since it's taking me 6 years to get my associates and I don't have a girlfriend yet at 23. I still trying my best every day is just that it's always hard to compare myself to others and think my life is a total failure. 
18xa89z,Depression,2024-01-03,Please read,"I am so stumped and defeated. I need advice. I go to so many doctors appointments and get so many tests and they all come back pretty much normal. I got back on depression medicine after being able to not be on it for years and was able to go through the worst time in my life without the assistance of medicine and just therapy. I will give you guys a timeline. 

October - It started in October with a ear infection, it was incredibly mild. I was dizzy, brain fog, tired and just didn’t feel well but the dizziness made me anxious. Finished the antibiotics. Symptoms persisted with ear fullness but no pain, I felt like I couldn’t focus. 
Went to urgent care, ER , vestibular physical therapist, ophthalmologist, primary care physician. 

November- ALL symptoms still persisted but my anxiety got worse, everyday I was dizzy. Nothing I did made it better. I was drained and felt like this for a month. I got another round of antibiotics for the ear infection that I still had. I felt like I was in a constant state of fight or flight. It was hard to move and hard to do things because of the dizziness. 
I was so worn out about trying to find out what was wrong and nobody could find anything so it started messing with my mental health bad. 
Went to ER 2x, urgent care, vestibular physical therapist. 

December- this is where things really started to ramp up. Dizziness continued (of course), anxiety, couldn’t focus, incredibly tired, lack of motivation, no longer felt like eating as much. I laid on the couch and cried for days because every doctor I went to made me feel like it was all in my head and all I wanted to do was feel normal again. I finally and reluctantly decided to get on Wellbutrin and buspar (I was on it a couple years prior) and still kept having symptoms but the mental symptoms like intrusive thoughts and sadness really dulled down which helped. But I was still tired. 
Then one day the dizziness calmed down significantly to the point where I barely notice it when for months it was all I thought about. However the other symptoms continue. 
Went to primary doctor 2x, ENT, audiologist, physical therapy, chiropractor, psychiatrist. 

I am so beyond at a loss for where else to turn. It’s obvious the symptoms are not all in my head but it does wear on me mentally because I have yet to find answers. I’m trying any doctor that I can and I’m not looking for any sympathy I just need advice, help any type of information that could point me in the right direction.

18xa61u,Depression,2024-01-03,Breaking out of location-induced depressive habits/cycles,"I spent winter vacation 2 states away at my sister's house and had every intention of coming back from the break feeling renewed and more at peace with myself. I always seem to make progress with myself when I am at other people's houses -- with food, exercise, and routines in general.

However, once I come back to my house I fall right back into these same old depressive habits of not doing anything. It's like my room is a black hole, swallowing all motivation the second I enter. Over the last couple of years this is the place I would spend doing drugs and isolating myself so I am not surprised this is what my brain may be defaulting to while I am in this room. Does anyone have any tips on breaking out of this??

 I guess the most apparent thing would be to spend less time in my room. However, I live with 4 room mates in a house and the common areas are not always the most comfortable thing for me.?? Ugh idk, feeling kind of helpless right now. Winter definitely doesn't help, I absolutely hate the cold and the dark ))): "

190cshs,Depression,2024-01-06,"I've tried to be the best daughter possible to my mom and today after asking her if she wants food she told me she wants me to die in hell , please someone read this","My parents fought, I am 29 years old, I should know how to detach myself from these problems, or even better, I should not be in this house anymore. But I am and I do everything possible to be my mom's companionship since she doesn't have that from my dad. I act like her therapist, she tells me all the saddest things a daughter can possibly listen to, and I can't ask her to stop or else she'll say that I am am awful daughter for not letting her vent w the only person that is still by her side. She does a lot for the entire family but my dad and her have always had a extremely toxic relationship and the issue here is that my mom hates the fact that her kids still love our dad. Today i spent the entire day out w my boyfriend and came home to find out that she'd been literally locked in her room the entire day and I sent her a message asking her if she wants food and she said that she wants all of us to die in hell , and told me that she hates everything she built in life and that we are the disgrace in her life and god is punishing her w us. All I did was ask her if she wanted food, all I did in this woman's life was be her fucking shadow , I spend 29 years of my life , putting aside all of my needs to try to make her life more tolerable, Instead of growing up and enjoying my youth, I wasted it by being always by her side like a shadow, for her to vent about how miserable her life is, but just because I can't possibly hate my dad and the entire population of this world, now I deserve to be dead. Even with her saying this to me, next time I see her, I won't be allowed to be angry at her, i walk around the house without ever being able to say what I truly think BC the environment at home is always terrible so I don't want to make it worse... I heard my mom say she wouldn't care anymore If my sister got RAPED , just BC one day she decided to go out w her friends instead of staying home after my mom had an argument w my dad. And I had to stay quiet after hearing such a disgusting statement.  I don't know when my breaking point will be, I don't know how much longer I'll be able to tolerate this. She managed to keep me completely dependent of her and there's an awful co dependent feeling I have w her. And even tho there's all of this I do love her but the fact that I am the only person from the house that still tries to speak to her, and she has the audacity to write that to me? I'd love to actually die, and write down very large writing on a wall ""I DID THIS FOR YOU! I HOPE YOU'RE HAPPY NOW""  she had a very bad relationship w my dad and that always makes me feel bad for her but she's starting to look more like a villain than the victim nowadays."

The only thing I have going for me is that sometimes I’m likeable by people around me and have weird charisma. 

I’m so sick of hospitals, medications, mostly beds, being online because what else can I do being stuck here. I’m stuck here and I’m not allowed to go anywhere while life is bustling around me and people supposedly love me a lot.

I know I will have to leave this place soon and I just don’t know where to start, so much of our money is tied up together. Living here I know I can’t even afford another place to live with all the current responsibilities. We’ve been together for a hole and have been living together for little over 2 years now. It’s just to a point where everyday is just so unbearable and no one seems to be happy, everything is a fight. Therapist says I’m responding to everything through this lens that’s clouding everything and affecting everything about me.

I wish I could just change that lens but it doesn’t seem possible and it doesn’t seem possible in time. We’re still trying to nail down my meds, have been on meds for a few years but hit a point where they weren’t providing enough of a benefit. I don’t want to be like this. I wish I could just not be but that’s not possible and I’m trying to talk to the people I need to (therapists/psychiatrists) but nothing is moving fast enough for where this relationship is at. I just don’t know what to do. I just don’t know how not to only view out of the current/only lens I have. I’m really trying and taking the meds I need to but nothing seems to be working in time or quick enough for my partner.

I’m 23 and depression runs in my family but it’s getting to the point where I hate everything, nothing brings me excitement (except for alcohol) and I lost interest in most of my past hobbies. I’m in school right now trying to finish my degree that’s been taking me 6 years to do. I don’t know what I want to do in life, have no motivation and basically have 2 friends that I barely see. The funny part is I don’t know why. I had a great child hood growing up, friends, parents, sports etc  but when I turned 17-18 something happened in high school that triggered my depression. After that I became depressed but I still could function and stuff actually brought me joy. But now it’s getting to the point of hopelessness. I would never unaliv myself but I pretty much think about it every other day. I just need advice because I don’t even know where to start. Oh also I’m a virgin and have never been in a serious relationship. Is this depression because of what happened to me in high school (trauma) or do I m feel this way  cause depression runs in my family ?

This is just a lost of the few bad things that have happened to me over the past 2 years

- mom diagnosed with cancer

- friend back home died in a fire 

- someone in my residence hall physically assaulted me and nobody believed me and administration refused action 

- family got evicted 

- family got evicted again

- dad promised to help paying my housing fees then stopped mid semester so I was forced to work 2 jobs on top of school as it was too late to take out loans 

- delt with a terrible boyfriend who bullied and SAed me

- terrible falling out with a friend group leaving me woth no friends at all for months (related to the physical assault)

- had a boss who was money laundering, refused to pay me, and harrased me

- got another job instead, which I absolutely hate

- therapist trend me away and accused me of fakeing depression

- rejected from every single academic and extracurricular activity I've tried for except one

And this is just the past 2 years. I mean I could go on and on. Meanwhile, I could list on one hand the number of good things that have happened to me my *entire life*
 
Therapy doesn't help, every therapist I've had has tried to just give me a more ""positive"" outlook but that doesn't change the actual reality of my life, which is shit. Drugs don't help. Nothing helps. Everyone says it will get better but with every year my life just keeps getting worse and worse. I'm sick of fighting tooth and nail for nothing. It feels like a joke. It feels like I'm being punished for a crime I didn't commit. Why not give up? Why not quit my job and live on my mom's couch? How would that be any worse than trying and failing over and over?

Im a recovering addict, sober for 6 years now, and finally making decent money and can live a healthy life with my financial freedom due to not having a significant other, kids, or animals. I've also knocked out all my debt (60k over 4 years), and have a decently recovering score. 687 from 430, 6 years ago.

I've recently taken a very well paying job in a new city halfway across the country away from everything and everyone I know. 

I needed a big change or I felt I was going to fall into the same distructive patterns. 

But here I am. Making almost 100k/yr, and still depressed. I have no desire to spend my money. I've honestly given more out than I have spent on myself just because it feels more rewarding to help others than materialistic stuff to keep me content momentarily.

I am about to move into an apartment after living in an Airbnb/my truck for the past few months, but honestly I might just keep living in my truck. I don't have any desire to purchase furniture for some reason. I'm content with the space I have in my SUV, I just really wanted an apartment so I can rinse off and cook better meals. But idk...

18x8wbo,Depression,2024-01-03,I am tired.,"I have been invisible my whole life. Only there if someone else needs me to be there. My parents neglected me. All of my ""friends"" materialize when they need something from me, but I never get calls for going for coffee, or doing fun nights out. When I text people to initiate things I get left on read. I'm a hard worker and people know this, so they will exploit that. But I can't find friends. My partner puts everything before me. My needs are always last. People never remember my birthday. I'm just a shadow and I've been one my whole life. 

I've tried to make friends. I really have. People just look from the person on my left to the person on my right and never look at me. I feel empty. Like a ghost. And I really feel like no one would miss me. This phenomenon that has persisted my entire life (I'm in my late 30s now) has made me not believe in  a god. This god people try to preach about a god who loves everyone and wants the best for everyone, so why hasn't anyone in my life ever given a fuck about me? Why would a loving god make someone like me and force me to live a life like this? How can I ever believe in something like that? Even my therapist dumped me. He said I ""graduated."" I'm still depressed and painfully lonely. How the fuck have I graduated? 

I try to be kind. I listen to people when they talk. I read and keep up on current events so I can hold thoughtful conversations with people. I maintain my personal hygiene. I'm helpful. I smell good. I brush my teeth. I smile when it's appropriate, and laugh when it's appropriate. I don't want the spotlight. I just want a friend. In a world of almost 8 billion people how can someone be so lonely? How am I supposed to beat depression alone? How do you make friends? What am I doing wrong? Because I'm not good for myself alone. I don't want the depression to win. But how do I keep doing this when every day is a tomb?"
18x8u9x,Depression,2024-01-03,You dont want to feel anything?,"This post is rather not so much about me but i had heard people say they wish to not feel anything at all rather than be depresed, and as a person who is completely devoid of any emotions for the past 3 years, i can tell you how it feels

Imagine this:


People love you, you cant love back

Everybody around you is happy, you arent

Your at a funeral and everybody is crying and sad, you arent, at best your bored

Sad or depresed people still can find a spark and get better, you cant

You get your dream thing and achive you life goals, so what, that is no longer sepical for you

You get a new iphone or a ps5 or a damn tesla, you feel nothing, its meaningless

You cant enjoy anything at all, life is bland, you  will never get that good feeling again

Thinking about using drugs? 
No, that dosent work, can make u hyper or halucinate but not feel anything at all

Its your bithday and u got like 20 warm presents from your family, your not happy at all but have to pretend you are

You literally cant enjoy anything at all, ur unable to feel anything but empty 

That is full numbness, what i expirience right now and sure, you cant get sad or angry either but after some time u get so miserable that it makes you throw your life away because you no longer care about anything, its basically death sentance, u live but still watch days just pass by until you die 

Im not here to say that being depresed is better but think before saying that you wish cant feel anything and try to focus on being happy instead because after that point,theres probably no going back because you wont care if your numb anymore"

I really began to notice that adults in the workplace don't behave significantly different than they do when they were in, say, middle school.

Over the next few years until now (I'm 35); I also began to notice how immature many of the older adults in my family are.

I remember my brother (he's over 16 years older than me) once telling me that his mind hasn't changed since he was about 13 years old and that he's been able to take care of himself since then. I, too, feel as if my mind hasn't changed all that much since I was 13--but I wouldn't necessarily say that I was capable of taking care of myself at that age.

Our mother (77 years old) and my father (aged 62) are also remarkably immature for their age--as are many of their siblings--as is my grandmother."

By living with my girlfriend, I've realized that she is dead set on becoming something in this world, proving people who doubt her wrong and just living her best life. I feel like I am the exact opposite in a sense.
I feel as though I see the world for what it is... Society and Religion control us all in a perpetual never ending cycle. 

How long am I supposed to keep up this facade?
Is my whole life purpose is just to experience the things everyone else experiences and (pretend to) be happy and satisfied? 

What actual reason do most of the people on this earth live for? Simply because it's the only thing to do and the alternative is grim. I can't believe in religions because of this also. We believe in gods simply because we don't like the thought of living for nothing.

I think that it's mainly my perception of the world that upsets me to this point. For some reason I can't just fall in line and become a functioning member of society.

TW - Anxiety, depression and there is another TW for a paragraph later on that refers to suicide but there is a warning before it is mentioned.

My Story:
Okay, I've thought for a while and am not sure exactly where to start. But I decided I should start at when I began high-school (as I live in the UK this is at age 11 in year 7) this is because it's around the time it began to further my anxiety which inevitably resulted in my depression.

My anxiety has always been present in my life, ever since I was very little, but it never caused too much disruption as I would go everywhere with my mother and this would make me feel okay. However, when I got to high-school things obviously became a bit different. This was the time where I was supposed to let go a bit and hang out with friends. But the idea of hanging out with people outside of school was always quite scary for me to do alone, so I would only ever talk to people in school. Which means that after it was time to go home this is where these relationships would end. This is because at the time I didn't have any social media, because that too made me anxious to use, so I didn't really have a way to communicate with them.

I'm now going to skip ahead two years to year 9, or around the age of 13. This is of course where lockdown begun. Now during the first lockdown I still did not have any social media, so during this time I would spend every day like the last. I would wake up, do school work, watch youtube, fall asleep, and then repeat. This really ruined me. I used to be quite in touch with my emotions, but after the first lockdown I moved them somewhere else. I became so out of touch with my emotions that I was unable to have physical contact with members of family, because it made me uncomfortable. I was unable to tell people that I loved them, including my mother, since that too made me severely uncomfortable, and I no longer wanted to be around people as much as it tired me out. Constantly pushing my emotions down would be extremely hard and I would hold in crying until I knew for certain I was alone. This resulted in anger replacing every other emotion when I was around family. 

TW paragraph - lightly mentions suicide:

I'm now going to skip to my final year of high-school (year 11, aged 16) to try and keep this a bit shorter as it's already quite long. By this time I had finally gotten social media and was somewhat close with some people from school, but still did not go outside for anything, apart from to go to school and that was literally it. My depression had worsened by this point from always hearing about what fun other people would seem to have without me, don't get me wrong my friends were great, and would always invite me to things even though I would repeatedly turn them down. Around this time I had begun to think of stuff like ending things, to this day I have never tried. But I had this habit of when I would wake up I wrapped my cover and pillows around my face and would lie there for a while hoping that my air would cut out and I'd sort of just not wake up.

Now I'm going to move on to the present day as I'm now in college (year 12, aged 16). I had zero of my friends from high-school move to my college, so I currently know nobody. As a result of my own stupidity I now have no friends. This is due to not going out, I have lost contact with everyone from high-school already and am completely alone. I don't speak to people anymore apart from a good morning occasionally to my family and that's it. I am truly by myself. Every single day is the same and when I don't have college I lie in bed watching youtube and sleeping. I feel so sick of repeating the same thing over and over again and all I look forward to is my rather interesting and unique dreams and get sad on the days I don't have any. Whenever I've tried to pick up a hobby I'm just not good at it and get bored and go back to sleep. This is my life story and I doubt anything will ever change. As to not worry people I must confirm that I would never try to end things I just plan on living my boring and mundane life out until my inevitable end. If you've read this far I must say well done I wrote more then I expected. Thanks for reading - 🙃"

I’ve always been the person that when people said smile, I smiled. I made people laugh at my jokes. I watched others be happy. I watched from the outside. Always. I’m 52 and I’m still sad. I’m still looking for hope. That joy. That smile."

18zioy9,Depression,2024-01-05,i feel like such an outlier,"i have no job, barely any friends, all of my existing friends do drugs and drink while i don't. i don't have my future planned out and my classes are absolutely destroying my self esteem right now. it feels like everyone around me has their shit figured out and im just there. i kind of wish i got into a car accident or smth and just died, i don't want to try suicide again because im too much of a pussy."
18x74cy,Depression,2024-01-03,Anxiety,"When i smoke weed i would compare the level of anxiety and negative feelings that i experience to the maximum amount that I could possibly experience. It feels like I've just murdered somebody and their children were the witnesses lol... 

The worst part is that I've smoked weed almost every day since I was 15 and ill be 28 this monday.. I just like having some semblance of control over how I feel I guess. I have struggled with chronic depression from a very early age. 

I have fought against the odds and ""made it"" as a chef, i make almost 100k for a 40 hour work week in the food service industry and have always excelled and been a leader in this industry my entire adult life. I have a house with a pool in a good neighborhood in california. I have friends, family, a very supportive girlfriend, several great relationships, and I consider myself academically as well as physically gifted. I just want to feel good about myself. But I don't. I often wish for death. There's nothing I want to accomplish. Nothing I do feels good. I am NEVER having a good time even for a second. I fight for my life to get out of bed every morning, yet I've never even called out of work or missed a single thing in life, but I just do it because I couldn't possibly handle making things worse.. it's not that I'm not doing what I want. Damn near every aspect of my life is the result of successfully accomplishing exactly what I've set out to do after much thought.

For a 2 year bought I tried several medications through a psychiatrist, resulting in me swearing off medical help - it didn't help at all and we basically tried everything. I even quit smoking weed as well as drinking all together (which I don't do a lot) 

I've gone to the gym for months at a time, I've gone to college, I've always eaten healthy; my doctor described my blood work as ""basically off the charts healthy"" 

I dont know what the fuck to do. I could quit smoking weed I guess, I've done that many times and it didn't help. The worst things ever got was 3 months dead sober when I drove myself to a mental hospital only to leave, I wasn't a danger to myself or others, I wasn't delusional, the suffering would have been impossible to explain, i cried in the parking lot and i left.. 

I've began making peace with my entire life being a wash. This is not a desirable experience. I am not suicidal, I see zero point. I'm just gonna suffer - life feels extremely short anyways as the years just fly by. 

My mom my grandma and my sister all have/had bipolar, I apparently don't have bipolar (according to psychiatrists) as I am ALWAYS depressed. 

What a rip off."
18x6q5n,Depression,2024-01-03,I'm lost,"I feel like I'm just wading through life. I have no immediate or long term goals. I don't even know if I should have any. I've been told that taking it one day at a time is OK but is it really OK to live day to day? Is it OK to not have a plan? I've often felt that I should establish some means to distract myself but that's only half the battle.

Forgive me for overthinking. It's a vice of mine. What really mean to say is I'm looking for direction in life. I currently have no friends who live nearby so things often get lonely for me. People will say I need a hobby. Some might say I should seek professional help.

18x6jeh,Depression,2024-01-03,No hope,"TW: mention SA

As I reflect on 2023, I feel no hope for 2024.

In 4 days, it would be a year of me being 5150'd. I was there for a week, in a facility that had absolutely 0 care for anyone inside.
A month later, I would attempt to gain a restraining order on the person that basically sent me into a panic qttack that led to the 5150. They were harassing my mother and I and although the order was denied, it stopped them from contacting us.

During the spring, I spent a good amount of my time with a FWB that I had known for 2 years. He was facing homelessness and I considered him a friend. I didn't want to see him go through that and would give him care packages when I can. He was able to get his own place, which I was happy for him. Then he just stopped wanting to hang out.
I got into a relationship with someone that I cared about. It didn't work out the last time because they moved away for work and we had to split. I don't even know if that was the truth but I'll never know. He broke up with me, saying he was hesitant on getting back together and thought that being with me would help his mental health. When it didn't, he just broke up with me and is now pursuing the person he originally wanted.
A few days after, I decided to hit up the FWB I hung out with. Why? I don't know. I felt lost, and wanted someone to be around. He knew what happened. He knew I didn't want to have sex. I told him I didn't want to have sex and just wanted some company because I was so sad. He eventually started to have sex with me until I began crying uncontrollably because I thought of my ex. Once I eventually calmed down, he started having sex with me again. I froze. He would reposition me however he wanted, until he wanted to flip me over. I left to use the bathroom then packed my stuff to leave. He was still there, naked, as if he expected to continue having sex.


After being 5150'd, it was then I realized I was alone. I am grateful for my siblings that are around my age, as they are the only people I live for. My parents are awful. My dad saying I have shit in my brain. My mom constantly watching and listening for everything I do. My friends kept themselves at a distance for me. I continued to help them plan things like their birthday. I spent mine alone, with no one wanting to plan things. Bought my own cake. To celebrate being 26, I felt, and still, feel like a loser.

I work with a vulnerable population, but with inconsistent hours (clients cancellations, my poor mental health sending me to a panic attack before a session leading me to cancel it), make it so difficult for me to save money to try and move out. I love my job but, because of how my mental health has been all throughout 2023, it feels like I'm doing such a poor job at work. I'm waiting to get fired at this point because I don't think I deserve to still be here.

I have a therapist that I see 1x (sometimes 2x) a week. I'm on meds for my mental health. But it feels so pointless.

I numb these painful things with weed. I don't even have a desire to want to use weed anymore either. I don't have much hope for myself. I want to end it all, that it nearly becomes an everyday prayer for me to wish my life would be taken away. I'm too scared to do it myself.

If you managed to read all this, I apologize for being a downer. These thoughts are constantly running through my brain the entire end of the year until now."
18x6izq,Depression,2024-01-03,It just gets worse,"Been struggling with depression for 22 years now. Now at the age of 30 it's harder than ever to keep looking ahead. I've used my connections with others as a motivation to keep going, telling myself I don't want to hurt the people that care about me. Well, now I've been living for my dog the last 3 years, he's been my everything, but he's a senior dog now and genuinely scared for when he's gone. All dreams have been taken away, even the small ones most take for granted. The people I've cared most for have died in my very arms. I've lived a trauma filled life that most wouldn't believe, so it's made it hard to connect with new people. Hard to tell your story when it's mostly negative and uncomfortable. I've done everything that's said to do. Therapy, inpatient care, medication, reaching out, I've even made groups while I was still in school, physical and social programs outside of mental health... Tried everything since I was a teen. The universe seems to just keep telling me to fuck off. I'm beyond tired at this point. The future looms ominously, the past refuses to let go, and the present offers few gifts."

If I think about it, it still makes me cry to this day. My hair keeps falling a ton… my heart breaks a little every time I looked down at my brush. Have any of you gone through this?? Did you over come?? 
So far, what I have been doing is using rosemary oil and jojoba oil. I also wash my hair every 3-4 days."
190akmh,Depression,2024-01-06,I have been feeling really suicidal lately and I don’t know what to do.,"I am a Muslim and I usually feel really happy with my religion and I love doing research and learning more. I researched Islam for 4 years then reverted 2 years ago. And I thought I was smart. 

I got into working out and Marcial arts. And I felt really happy. 
My mental health sickness went away and I recovered from the pain I got from my dad abusing me and my mom . 

But recently it’s all come back. 

I started getting anti Islamic content showing up on my recommendations on YouTube. At frist I tried to argue with it (and I almost always won) but then I started having painic attacks and bad dreams thinking Islam might not be true.

(I’m going to be brutally honest here) 
I started using Porn and drugs as a comping mechanism. My whole world has destroyed. 

I’ve delt with wrose pain on paper. But something about this is eating me from the inside. 

Even when I’m with my family (who I used to enjoy watching movies with and chatting with) all I can think about is killing my self. I can’t talk to anyone about it so I’m using this old account

190660o,Depression,2024-01-06,I'm really lonely,"I don't know if this is the best place to post this, but this problem has put me in a really depressed state of mind. I've literally had no human interaction for the past five days, minimal interaction. 

Here's what happened:

&amp;#x200B;

I returned to college in late December for the next semester. My roommate and I had fought before leaving for our winter vacations, and had kind of sorted the issue out. It was basically related to abusive words and all. If she uses them, then so will I.  
  
Anyways, I thought things would be okay this semester and we guys, we have a group of seven girls, all decided on an outing two days before my birthday. But on the day of the outing, I realized that she had drifted further from me. Let me give a brief introduction of all the girls in the group:  
  
1. Roomie: loves to eat, basically jumps ship to whoever treats her nicely. Gets over excited too quickly.   
2. A gossip girl: loves to poke her nose into other peoples business. Roomie and she got close.  
3. A neighbouring room girl: she and roomie together are a nightmare. she's weird  
other 3 are okay.  
  
So bascially, the next day(sunday), I was kinda down after realizing that she and I aren't closer any more. I had my birthday on New Year's day :( trust me, my birthday has always sucked. My roomie didn't talk to me on the day before my bday, but then, at midnight, when we all clicking pictures,she said she wanted to be next to me in each picture, and shoved her way there. Then, she went back to talking with gossip girl. I was determined to make atleast this a happy birthday, but that didn't happen. In the morning, my other roomie(let's call her dancer, she dances really well), was out with her other friends. She had plans with them.   
  
No one asked me what I wanted to do on my bday, they were busy in their own circle, and I was part of atleast one circle, and yet felt so lonely. Still, I dressed up and went outside with a friend of mine. But, my mood had soured. At night, they were all busy in their phones, not paying attention to me.   
  
Tuesday(the next day after my bday), I was really upset that they'd all drifted apart from me. It sucks when you feel lonely even in a circle of 7 people. It sucks when you feel lonely when you are surrounded by 20 other girls who you talk to, but you don't really care for you.   
  
As an instinctive self defence mechanism, I stopped talking to everyone, before I'd even realized. And you know what,no one even asked me why I wasn't talking, why the usually talkative me was silent. It's been five days, and no one has tried to make an effort to even ask what's wrong. It's like they don't even care about my existence, except for when I have to treat them.   
  
Because you know what? They all asked me for a treat 2 days ago. All the 20 girls did, they asked me for a treat, and not for why am I so down these days. Fine, I gave them all the treat. I had to, it's not like I don't go to the treats others give. And then, it was again like I didn't exist.  
  
Currently, they are outside my room, deciding what to do on the day of our fest, it's nearly 3 weeks away from now. None of them deigned to ask me to join them. Life sucks. It's my first year at college, and yeah, look at how it's going.   
  
My bday sucked, again. I don't know why I expected this year to be different. There hasn't been a single bday when I didn't cry since the past 9 years, and no, I'm not talking about tears of happiness. I'm not talking to them again, and yet I'm so lonely. I can't immerse myself in my books and kdramas 24/7. I too need someone physically present to talk to. I just hate my life currently. If humans are like this, I'd rather drown myself in a fictional world.   
  
So here I am, writing this to all of you sitting in my room, alone. I just give up!"
18zvjhw,Depression,2024-01-06,"If I didn't have a child, I would kill myself.","I'm at a deep low. Like. Probably lowest I've been in a good awhile. This time of year (health insurance season) always makes me this way. Chronically ill but make too much for government assistance yet make way too little to be able to afford outside insurance. 

I feel like a burden to every single person I know. I feel like if I didn't exist, peoples lives would definitely improve. Nobody would be worried about me. Nobody would wonder about me. Nobody would give a fuck. 

There's a pit in my stomach and my throat that let's me know I'm on the edge and that I want to say fuck all and just end it. I'd be better off if I did. But I don't want to leave my child motherless. Times are really really tough right now and he's the only thing keeping me going. And it sucks because he could have a much better woman as his mother yet he's stuck with me. A fat, ugly, lazy, disgusting, good for nothing low life who has accomplished nothing. I can't even physically work anymore. 

I'm hoping for better days, but I doubt they'll come."
18x6chg,Depression,2024-01-03,Long term depression,Hello everyone. I’ve popped in and out of this subreddit for years. Never posted or commented. Figured I’d start out this year with some openness. I’ve been struggling with anxiety and depression for as long as I can remember. Seems to be getting worse the older I get. Regardless if things are good in my life my mind will zero in on something negative and create a sense of doom. I just recently got out of a relationship with a girl I’m still very in love with. Definitely doesn’t help my mental state. I would not call myself suicidal but I’m definitely not pro being alive either. I honestly don’t know what the point of this post is. A cry for help or just a way to vent? I have nobody to talk to. Most of my family is dead and the one close friend I had passed away last year. I hate going to work but also hate being home. Maybe it’s time to turn to medication? I also have a track record of sabotaging myself. Almost like I’m so used to being miserable that that’s all I deserve. Don’t really know what to expect when I hit post but I’m definitely open to some conversation and opinions on what I can do to maybe break this cycle.

18x5y9e,Depression,2024-01-03,I just want to be invisible,"I don't want anyone to see me, Nd I don't want to see anyone. 

Safe at home away. 

I don't want to burden anyone. 

Go to work, smile, small talk. Do my job go home. Don't annoy anyone. Keep myself to my self. Don't take a pack lunch, or bank card. ""What are you having for lunch?"" Sit in my car and vape. No bank card so can't buy food. Don't eat. 

Spent a few days at my boyfriends. Couldn't eat, feel shit about myself, don't eat. Didn't eat. I passed out. I wanted him to care but he didn't. Why would he. I'm a burden. Hide medication. I don't want to be that woman with mental health issues he dispises. Don't be a burden.

Bed rot, vape, don't eat. I'm fat and ugly. The bigger I am the more in the way I am.

Someone's walking past me, don't make eye contact look down and walk on the curb. Stay invisible and unnoticed. 

See my friends once a month or two. (We all love in different cities). Have a laugh have a drink have a dance. Everythings going good i can't complain. Make jokes act silly, scran take away at the end of the night. Go home, bed rot don't eat the next day. 

My mum brings me snacks and treats. Say thank you and appreciate her spoiling me. Put in the freezer don't eat I'm too fat. Vape and nap.

Eat enough in front of people so they don't suspect anything. Don't eat the next day. 

Shower and brush my teeth, do my self care. Try my best to crack on my mask. No one will notice a thing. Stay invisible and unquestionable.

18x5xxq,Depression,2024-01-03,I feel stupid,"I genuinely feel so stupid for feeling the anxiety and possible depression I do. And I said possible because I’m not diagnosed with anything but it feels that way. I cry most days, I feel stress in my chest, and I generally am always tired or miserable. I feel stupid bc it’s mostly from school. I take a lot of APs and they’re so much work and I put so much pressure on myself. I’m currently top of my class and I really want that title but achieving that continues to be painful. I also have regular issues I guess with insecurity, I’m a hypochondriac, and I feel depressed in large groups because I see people happy around me and it makes me sad that I’m not. Looking on all these things I just can’t help but feel dumb. There are other people in my classes who are not suffering to the same extent as me bc I’m prolly just being dramatic. And at the same time there are people who suffer worse than me for worse things and then I feel bad for feeling depressed bc my life is good generally speaking. On paper I should be happy, but I’m not. I don’t know what to do."

I’m not mentally ready for the semester, all I do is work and take care of my baby. I have a lot of pressure on me to graduate but I don’t even think I’m capable of doing so. Everyday I wake up I want to just lay in bed and cry I feel so lost and alone. I’m trying to be grateful for everything I have and push forward but somedays I don’t even want to be here. I also struggle with obesity and have a plethora of health conditions that I should be in the hospital for but I have to work and provide for my family. I feel ashamed when I look at myself and I’ve tried taking  small steps to better my health like cutting out juice and drinking tea and water and I try not to eat after 6pm.

Failed every goddamn class my first college year, GPA only BARELY saved by dropping 2 of the three. My fucking scholarship is on the line because of my chronic failure. If I wasn’t such a goddamn lazy leech on society…whatever. And it’s not like the degree will even help. Even with a good paying job I’m still heavily dependent on people due to life circumstances.

18ztxnp,Depression,2024-01-06,advice on cancelling socialization,"Hey, so I've been going through an awful depressive episode and I'm currently altering my medications. Over the holidays I returned to my home city for 3ish weeks and that is where my high school friends are. At first, I agreed to plans and the day of I felt awful and needed to cancel, I did this 3 times. 

After 3 times of this happening my friend called me out on it. Though it wasn't from a case of concern on why it was happening rather it was more of an attack towards me. I know it is completely justified to be upset with me for this but also note that the things I cancelled have been group activities that continue just without me. I got called lazy and they asked me why I was being so emo.... awkward. I didnt really want to respond to that. I just used the classic tired excuse. 

This brought me a lot of guilt and my friends used it as ammunition to try and convince me to go to social events and that I was being a bad friend. I am scared to see them as everytime I talk to them/show up I get called out on it and it immediately makes me feel worse. I am very irritable lately and saying something/doing something can set me off (I don't usually snap I just usually stop talking)

Anyways to get to the point here,

My friend was also ""depressed"" but could still be social and I am dramatic.them about why it was hard for me and the change in medications impacting me physically. They had plans today and two of my friends came to me telling me that 

1. My friend was also ""depressed"" but could still be social and I am just dramatic.
2. My other friend is upset with me because when she ghosted me during the summer I got upset with her so I am a hypocrite. (This story is really complicated and much more layered but I believe I was in the right)

The friend who is upset with me was supposed to see me + two others tomorrow, she might be cancelling though. I don't know how to react if she starts going off on me

How do you guys explain to friends how this impacts you socially? Honestly, I just want to break down...

I would be honest about how I feel but they have been pretty judgy about it before and I would rather be vague so it doesn't turn to gossip. Thanks for any advice!

18ztvte,Depression,2024-01-06,I think I gave up several days ago,"I posted here yesterday, I'm not sure why. I went from sleeping through the morning, afternoon, and evening to not sleeping at all. I've been up since Thursday morning maybe, or maybe it was since Wednesday. I have a hard time keeping track of the days. 

I zone out playing a relaxing game but I know I'm only playing to keep myself busy and prevent the desire to just roll over and sleep. I haven't eaten in a day or so. I've had a few sips of water with my meds yesterday. I haven't showered since Saturday/Sunday. I've been in the same clothes all week. I have given up in as many ways as I can and I don't know. I'm not sure I want things to get better. 

This feels like the only way to undo myself. I don't think I mind that it's going to take awhile. I feel done with life and 2 weeks away from my 37th birthday, I just want out. I don't want to do this another year. I'm over it all. I think I've had all I can stomach or rationalize away as ""just how life is."" I don't want to do this anymore. 

I spent some time earlier this week trying to figure out how to hang myself but I eventually kind of moved on from the thought when I didn't feel confident that I'd be able to tie it in the right way to pass out before asphyxiation. Every way feels like such a gamble that my anxiety and self-doubt just force me to give up on the notion of actively taking my life because I feel like I won't get it right and/or I wind up in a condition or state where I can't do ANYTHING about anything anymore. It's like I can't win. I don't want to do this anymore and I shouldn't have to."

18zq195,Depression,2024-01-06,Huh,"Howdy y’all, just looking for some quick advice

So I’m 24, and have had “chronic” depression since I was born.  I thought and planned out killing my self when I was 6 years old.  

It hurts,  a deep, deep pain,  I cannot even cry anymore.  I will say,  I will never take my own life,  never,  I cannot do that to my mother.  But,  looking at my weapons and wet dreaming about a 7.62 to the brain is getting really old.  

I’m physically attractive, I have a good heart,  I lay down myself to help others,  I have a house, pets, I have a future (although it is really hard to see). 

I think it’s time to accept that this is chronic,  it might be a part of me.  Guys,  how do I keep going?  My family needs me… I’m the only one who will change the course of my blood line, the only one who can.  My family line will die or continue because of me,  I can’t falter.

How do I keep going when I’ve had suicidal ideation since 6 years old?  How do I keep going when I’m disgusted at my past sins?  How do I forgive myself?  Will I ever look at my handgun and not imagine shooting myself with it?  I’ll be here until I die naturally, but Lord, I want to be happy while I’m here. 

TLDR:  this might’ve been a rant, idk, but anything anyone adds; thanks."

18zn8aq,Depression,2024-01-06,extreme self loathing caused by my weight and body,"never wanted to resort to ranting on reddit but it feels like i have no one to really talk to so ill just do this. sorry if this doesn't go here by the way.

i cannot stand my body at all. I hate myself to extreme lengths because of it. ive never been comfortable in it and i never will be. for the past few years I've been super health conscious, working out near everyday, tracking calories and staying in a deficit, eating better in general. ive made some progress, definitely, have gone from 230lb to 125lb. but its just not enough. i still feel and look so fucking fat and gross and i cant stand it. 

my stomach and back has been holding onto so much fat I don't know what to do. I start to cry every time i look in a mirror at this point. and then people, especially my parents, say i look extremely thin and worry cuz of it but they don't know what i see and what I actually look like and i don't know what to do anymore. doesn't help I fucking hate everything else about me and my appearance too. i thought losing weight would make me feel better, but no. Not at all. im still fucking dysgenic. every single thing about me and my body is wrong. 

Not asking for advice or sympathy or anything. i just wanted to dump my thoughts somewhere. hope everyone else is doing well this time of year"
18zlwn5,Depression,2024-01-06,wow it’s hard,"Man nowadays I feel like I’ve got no control over things, like I drive to random places at random times just to try and kinda take some control back or at least that’s why I believe I do it. I’m stuck in a boring degree I have no interest in and with that comes the avalanche of responsibilities that just come and relentlessly assault my mind, and now they the holidays came I believed that a break would visit too but I still find myself experiencing the same shit, but hey at least I’m with family rn until I have to leave again in a week or so. Still I’m unsatisfied with how it’s going rn, shit would be different if I wasn’t so awkward with things, like people, my flatmates, and everything. Always trying to appear cool or something, it’s so sad.
ig we’ll see how it goes because I don’t know people"
18zlm4w,Depression,2024-01-05,My brother said I did this to myself,"I’ve been suffering with anxiety and depression for a couple years now and as a fact have become noticeably less energetic and more lethargic. I’ve shared my experiences with my brother and recently even shared about my self harm thoughts in the hope that he understands my life. Most days I have zero energy to do anything, I work 9-5 to hold down a job, cook at times if I can but other than that I’m usually on my phone scrolling mindlessly. I’ve been fighting with my brother for the last two days since he’s been saying I don’t get enough exercise and always stay home and don’t put efforts to get over my depression. I’ve been in therapy for almost 1.5 years, it’s helped me get out of my head a little but I haven’t been on medication since I’m skeptical. Today I was trying to communicate to my brother that some days I hardly have energy to get out of my bed or make food or worse, eat food that’s already home and he said I did this to myself. That I was not born with it and I did this to myself because I don’t follow clean diet and exercise regularly.

It sucks to share these details with someone close only for them to have it throw it back in your face saying “you did this to yourself”"
18zlirc,Depression,2024-01-05,These are my thoughts about Life and why I'm depressed (TRIGGER),"The reciprocity of people's actions appear to be rooted in self-interest, forming the basis for human interactions. Human behavior, driven by evolutionary tendencies, can be perceived as hypergamic, with desires often focused on what seems unattainable. Sexuality is influenced by context, fantasy, and socialization for women, while most men experience a strong primal urge to just have sex with weak levels of success. Evolution, indifferent to the romantic aspects of life, prioritizes optimal replication. Belief in true love and soulmates serves as protective narratives against the harsh realities of existence. Soulmates, considered rare, emerge from a complex interplay of conditioning and preferences. Human behavior, including morality and empathy, can be psychologically explained, serving societal stability. All the thoughts that run through our heads are predetermined electrical nerve impulses that come to our consciousness with a delay. Everything we see, smell, hear and feel are signals from an apparent ultimate reality that are processed into impressions in our brain. People all talk about the good in people, but they still hurt their fellow human beings when they can take advantage of it. Morality and empathy are there so that we don't all kill each other, they make us feel guilty in order to keep society in check. People suffer terribly from mental illness, kill themselves and go crazy. People talk about how we should find meaning in everything, but we are only products of our neural networks and brain chemistry and are determined to choose something specific. And despite the high probability that it all makes no sense, we don't know what happens after death, perhaps there is something even worse waiting there?"

18zkxoe,Depression,2024-01-05,Depressed over love life.,"Hi, I'm 24. Some year and a half ago I broke up with my then girfriend, she was my first and so was I hers, we had a two-year long relationship. Since the breakup quite alot went down in my life, I failed at uni, my pet dog, which was very dear to me, passed, a family member got diagnosed with Alzheimer's. That all happened quite fast after the breakup and sure I was sad, but I didn't feel depressed. Now the last couple months I have had severe depression, I started develloping a drinking problem, I smoke nearly a pack a day and when i have a breakdown, which happens now and then I cut myself in my forehead to feel the blood run down my face, which calms me. 

I supose it started when I restarted college and I started develloping feeling for a girl in my class. In my eyes she was perfect, I imagined a life with her. By now I was already in this depression and some month ago I asked her out, she rejected me. This only made things worse for me. I cry myself to sleep every odd night, I drink even more than before and I just don't see how I could fix this. I've tried just focusing on school or a hobby, which works for a little while but in the evening it all just comes down on me again. 

I don't have any suicidal intentions, but I can not see any solution to this."

Damn dont even know where to start. Came into the new year happy, ready to put work in to have a good year and be in a better position. But the past couple of years I have been dealing with a load of sadness. When I would be around my friends i would be faking smiles and laughter. But deep inside im dead. Felt like a dark cloud has just been hovering over me since 2021. Shit been tough fr, Im not even the type of person to cry but damn this shit really fucks with me especially when i dont have anyone to talk to. 

I was seeking help from therapists but stopped because I didnt want them to try call a nigga crazy lol. Fell into smoking a whole lot of weed just to numb how I was feeling. I just been dealing with depression,ptsd and anxiety but that really all stems from the same thing. To be honest my anxiety just keeps getting worse,i been fine the past week but people who shouldnt be in my life keep coming back and messing with my head and that just throws off my positive vibe. Earlier today my anxiety got the best of me, i thought I would have to go to the hospital for this shit. Shit really got the best of me.

Noone really knows what Im going through but me,noone really cares. Im saying that in general though noone really cares what you going through everyone is fake. 

Hopefully I can deal with these obstacles im facing better and I really want to.

But i dont know i just came across this subreddit and read a whole lot of people posted and I want to say the same way im praying to overcome times like this I pray you guys do too. 

Peace💙"

A month ago he just disappeared, and he told me recently he has a girlfriend, its going terribly for those two, I want him to be happy. I am struggling with so much as well as this, he is like my soap opera that comes in and is an explainable misery to other people. I have therapy coming up with my college but I feel I need more support. The drs say its a wait list of a year and a bit for any help. Today I had a call from the solutions team, in our session they basically said it was my fault for trying to feel better and overloading my days with activities. I feel I can't win, the advice is to swim, do yoga, eat well, sleep well, etc, but when I do all those things and I am still not coping its my fault? If I was doing any less they would tell me to do XYZ. I have also realised I don't think I will ever be able to have another relationship, let alone have sex with someone ever again. I can't see that working when I can't be in a room alone with a man. I feel very hopeless, I have been trying to be happy and good my entire life, I am doing almost everything perfectly.

18z7xiy,Depression,2024-01-05,I had my first ever breakdown last night after bottling it up for a long time and I'm scared.,"Not sure if I need to start seeing a therapist or a doctor, but I know something is wrong with me.

It's taken me alot to understand that i have a lot of problems I don't talk about.

A lot of promblems that i do a really good job of hiding and no one knows

I worry about these things constantly that cause me issues and sadness but i am able to supress them

Last night i couldn't suppress them, I had a bit of a breakdown just thinking about who i am and my future. 

At first i thought i was having a panic attack but then i just cried, for almost an hour last night. I've never done that before or its been a long time since i cried

Theres somthing wrong with me

The only way i can describe it is that I just feel so empty inside

I have no drive, nor purpose, nothing to look foreward too, like i look foreward to what i'm going to eat, or maybe going the gym and that's about it

I am not looking foreward to my 25th birthday in a month at all, rather i am just dreading it in reality. Because i don't see anything to look forward to.

I don't do anything besides work and go to the gym

But i would sometimes go out by myself like on a friday night to avoid just sitting alone in my appartment and when i went out i'd just stand in the corner alone at some of the bars and watch the football game or just look at the different groups of people actually enjoying themselves.

And i'd look around and see i'm the only one doing this alone

Then i would just go out and walk at midnight by myself

I did the same thing senior year of college

I spend 95% of my time outside work alone in my thoughts, doing nothing but on my phone
Sometimes i just drive, in silence
I sometimes go grocery shopping at 10pm on a friday night to just get out of my appartment

This whole thing isn't normal. This isn't normal just just have no one. And have no drive and just feel empty.

And the same thing goes for dating.

I've never had a g!rlfriend, I 've only ever been on 1 date when I was 20, and i'm still a v!rg!n. I get so depressed and bitter and jealous seeing couples my age, thinking why I can't have that, thinking about all my wasted years i'll never get back, as well as simply never being desired by a girl. This causes me so much unhappiness and it's not normal. 

And I'm on a time limit to find someone. My job has me living near a big city until the end of june when they are moving me back to a rural 5k person town in the middle of nowhere where I did my first 6 months of work. This will be my permanet position, and there is NO ONE out there from what I leanred my first 6 months working there before i was moved. It is a good high paying job, making 6 figures at 25, but i realize if i don't meet someone in my last 6 months here near the city, i sure as heck am not going to find someone in the small rural town, and i am legitimately sacred i will be alone for the rest of my life.

My problems are mostly self-inflicted, 

It's mostly self inflicted pain, i'm causing so much mental stress on myself and bottling up my emotions and sadness. 

And i do a good job of hiding it

Like when i  walked to the pier my my father last week during the christmas holiday week, i was on the verge of crying several times durring the walk but I'm able to suppres it enough.

But yesterday i was just so overwhelmed.

I'm lonely, I don't really have friends, i feel empty
I don't want to do this 
I don't want to end up alone
I have social anxiety and i'm shy
I have more negative thoughts then positive

I sometimes even feel miserable

Like i'm wasting my years

I've never been able to relate to people my age

I haven't really had any of the experiences most ""normal"" people have had.

I don't have any hobbies

I don't try new things 

I put so much stress on myself by worrying abouth things

I don't know how to be chill
I don't really know how to have a good time

I'm way too young to put so much pressure on myself

I have to distract myself untill the lonliness goes away"

I've been through so much in the past year, it started with the worst heart break I've ever had with the girl I loved and wanted to marry leaving me for her ex and getting engaged and pregnant in a short time. Then there's been death, family drama, loneliness, and something just switched off in my head and I'm starting not to feel in the same way I did. My family will be breaking down in tears having the most emotional talks I've ever had with them and I'll be like a robot just staring at them blankly unsure what to say and feel nothing. Any affection I get is starting to make me feel so uncomfortable and wonder what somebody's intentions are and I can't show any affection or do a favor without teasing at the same time to play it down so nobody thanks me or feels too grateful. I'm starting to push people away and I'm struggling to talk to anyone about really anything at all. I feel like I'm becoming an emotionless asshole because it's becoming harder and harder to care about anything or anybody even the people I love the most."

I‘ve really tried to be kind to myself but over time everything became a chore. Even the simplest things now like brushing my teeth, eat and even to just watch a movie or play a game. I am skipping work in home office everyday because my body refuses to get out of bed. I have tried to find new things to do and to pick up old hobbies. Literally nothing interests me anymore.

Can I be myself without losing the interest of my friends? I'm already not well liked and known as sort of a weirdo. I've had opportunities with girls, but zero girlfriends. Haven't had one. Because I was too scared to be rejected. The thought of not Being enough for someone I cared for, the possibility of getting made fun of and laughed at, it was too much for me. I decided to bottle up my feelings and play it safe again. Like I always do. I try living in my own sad little world but I'm always feeling sad because I know it's not real. I'd like to say I'm going in the right direction but every time I say that it's like I'm jinxing it. And then everything Fucks up. And I can't leave because my own little delusions are all I got.

I regret what I did to get into legal trouble very much and am apologetic. My crime was not internet related and occurred during the daytime though, so I am upset with the restrictions that I am placed under currently.
I have been to the hospital multiple times for depression and am very sad. I am off my medication because the only way I could get a refill where I live was through an online video appointment.
I do not have a girlfriend or any friends. I feel lonely. I have to deal with explaining that I am a felon and why to people every time I am asked why I don't have a smart phone.
I know that I deserve this pain and am mad at myself. I want to pursue a career in music but cannot use social media without risking a probation violation and facing more time. I am scared of AI taking over the music scene before I even have a chance of success.

I don't even actually want to write this post, but I really need to do something, but I just can't do it. I can't bring myself to do anything for the past few months, starting in the summer. i have been talking with so many friends of mine, everyone gave me motivation talks, my family poured money for me, and even though I knew what I had to do, and it was just so SIMPLE, I couldn't bring myself to do it. and here i am. i had worse times before, worse situations to be in, but this year is just the fucking WORST, because of me. i don't even feel panicked, i waited all these months to feel some panic so i can start to do something, but i am not even panicking. i know i will regret what am i doing, or what am i NOT doing, just sitting here, rotting, doing NOTHING, playing games. i am so bored of even crying about it, just like what am i doing right now, but i dont know what to think. i cant cry or rant to my friends about it anymore because they talked to me with all their might. everyone tried to support me. i just can't support myself.

i am sorry for not talking about the actual topic so far, but i just wrote down what came to my mind first. the situation is that i am an undergrad student. i have been an undergrad student for the past 6 years, because i changed my major. i  am 24, and 24 is an old age to still be in university. my dream was to get into phd, and throughout my major, i did everything in my power to fill my academic cv. for the past few months, all i had to do was apply to the phd, (i want to do a phd in the US) and i didn't do it. I just waited until the very last minute and weren't able to send more than half of my submissions. now , there are some schools left but i just feel so much worse. i didnt told my professors whom i had gotten a LOTR from that I haven't even used them, because I literally couldn't hand my submissions. i did it all in the very last minute and time was not enough. my school doesn't support me to stay in dormitory, so even though my family was financially suffering, they supported me to rent a house near my school to get good grades, and my grades are failing also. i couldn't do ANYTHING properly. as i said, there are some schools left for me to apply, but even trying to do it sometimes just gives me incredible pain. i have been writing my SOP's and scrapping it constantly. i knew i had to email to some professors beforehand, i even were talking about it in the beginning of the summer, but i still didnt do it. i really don't know what the fuck is wrong with me. all these time, every single day, i thought about doing it but did nothing. i spent every single minute of mine procrastinating. and whenever i sit down to do any of this stuff, i just can't finish it, i just can't like what i do, it is not like the any other stuff i have done, i feel like it is never, ever ENOUGH and 'for it to be enough i have to think about it more' i say to myself, and give up, and then never get back to it because it is just too hard to conquer. i was already scared of not being admitted to anything anyways.

in the pandemic, i promised myself that i will get into the phd in the US and get away from my life and my country, and if i couldn't achieve it then i would kill myself rather than being OK with living this shitty life. right now i may still have a chance at admissions, but i constantly think about what the fuck will i do if i won't be admitted. whenever i actually think about getting in , it also upsets me, because i don't like the schools left. i don't know why i am doing this to myself. i deeply know it is not rational at all and at this point i can't even talk to anyone about it, because nobody would understand me and they would be tired of me since i have been talking about applying for the past few months. i am a fucking imposter. i just like talking about stuff. i already want to kill myself. i just can't take it anymore. my life is over and i ended it myself in a very slow process.

I know i have to keep going but i just feel so numb. i don't feel anything. i just silently watch everything fall apart. "

All I keep thinking is if I would have just stayed on drugs, overdosed, or was killed, shit even put in jail my innocent baby would have still be here. He was 6’4” 220lb and the sweetest gentle giant. He was so silly and kind hearted. He didn’t curse, and he loved reading the Bible and going to bible study with me. Any social media apps we had he would make his page about sharing love, being kind, Jesus and god, and he didn’t follow anything that was morally good. I can’t understand why this had to happen. Why god had to take such an amazing child. He died cold and scared on the highway floor in the rain because his neck broke. I get flashbacks all day and night. There is no other pain more painful than holding your child’s lifeless body and cold. I’ll continue to pray for strength and forgiveness. I had to write how I feel before my heart burst. I always told him nothing would happen as long as he is with me. I’m don’t know how much longer I can take this torture."

18x56jp,Depression,2024-01-03,Peer Support/Respite,"I recently heard about places intended to help people with depression (and other mental illnesses) that are run by those who have experienced it themselves. I tried to find such a place where I live, but sadly we don't have anything of the sort here. I believe this could be something very helpful. Unfortunately, since I can't experience it here, I'm hoping someone here on this sub might be able and willing to share their experiences in such a place. 

What was it like? How long were you there? Did you find it helpful? What would you have changed?

I'm asking because I'm looking into the possibility of creating something like this where I live. First though, I need more info and while these places do exist it doesn't seem to be a very widespread treatment option."

I have a girlfriend, I have two dogs and I rent an alright apartment. But I still feel like a major fuckup. All my life I've been cast aside. I have no contact with my family, I have no friends or even acquaintances. My family is very succesfull, money and career wise and I can't stop comparing myself to them. 

I have like 500sek (40usd give or take) after all my bills are paid.
I no longer enjoy playing my videogames and that's always been a huge part of me, I don't like driving my car anymore and I see no point in going go work. Why should I work 40+hours for something that barely gets me by. 

I only really feel like myself when I'm taking a walk with my dog. We like to look up at the stars and remember the past. I don't necessarily want to go back because my childhood was shit, what I do want though is leave. Go somewhere where it's just me and my best pal.

18x4z6b,Depression,2024-01-03,I feel stuck and so hopeless,"This is kind of a shot in the dark posting on here because I have never done this before. I’m just so desperate for help and answers. I’m 23, I have struggled with depression and OCD since I was 6, but in the last 5 years my anxiety has gotten so bad, I feel like I am a completely different person. I dropped out of college, have no friends, live at home, and only work 16 hours a week because I can barely get out of bed I am so depressed. Im in therapy and on multiple medications after trying at least 7 different ssri and snri’s. I have really bad rejection sensitivity and have anxiety attacks and cry constantly when I feel anything I perceive as rejection. Someone could tell me no and I feel like I’m going to throw up and I start crying and hyperventilating but not because I was told no, but because I feel like I’ve been rejected and feel hated and get a wave of self hatred that makes me feel sick. Same thing with failure, I feel like I started seeing everything I do as a moral ‘good or bad’ and failure or success. I don’t know how to fix it. A few years ago I was in a bad car accident that gave me a pretty bad concussion and I don’t think I’ve ever been the same since. I cry constantly, I’m depressed, I have really bad self esteem and social anxiety, I pick at my skin compulsively  till I’m in so much pain and bleeding and my obsessive thoughts are crippling. My anxiety is overwhelming me. I don’t have a career, I can barely function, let alone do anything I enjoy, I can’t hone my skills to make a career, I don’t have money, I live at home, I don’t have a drivers license because I’m terrified to get behind a wheel because of the car accident. I feel stuck. I was hyperventilating and crying earlier and got so overwhelmed I started repeatedly punching myself in the head.. because I felt rejected and like I’m useless and hated. I feel like a failure and a loser and just fucking hopeless.  I wonder if it’s the ptsd or the concussion that’s making me like this. I want to get better. I think I could see a life where I’m living in an apartment with someone I love and I’m happy and enjoying life and the things I love, but I don’t know how to get there and I’m not sure I ever will get there because I am so anxious and so fucking scared and tired."

I feel like my dreams will never come true. I was SA'd last year and I'm still dealing with the fallout from that, including the difficult legal process. I wish I were dead, or better yet, an entirely different person. I just don't know what to do or how to cope anymore. "

I ruined it all for myself. I'm scared. I'm so so scared. I don't think I can continue living like this. I can't do it, I can't keep doing this. I can't live with this. I am having horrible thoughts of just ending it because I am scared. I'm scared of what will happen when I talk to him again, or if my family sees my scars.

18x4lgw,Depression,2024-01-02,Venting in a post - Depressed at 32,"I’m not sure this will help but nothing else seems to be working so I thought maybe venting here might help. I’m sorry if these thoughts are scattered and not focused. 

I started taking propecia at 22 years old and it gave me permanent erectile dysfunction.

I developed IBS at age 27. 

I got in a car accident at age 29 which herniated a disc in my neck and even after the disc healed I was left with arthritis in my neck.

At age 31, I was lifting 10 pound weights and a disc in my lower back herniated and after the disc healed I was left with arthritis in my lower back (mirror experience to my neck)

Now over the past year I’ve developed crippling panic attacks and depression to the point where I’ve temporarily moved back into my 60 yr old parents house because I can barely take care of myself (physically or mentally).

So now I can’t get an erection, move my neck or my back and I’m depressed basically 95% of the time and have been this way for almost 12 months. It just sucks. 

I’m going to cbt to help but I feel like I can barely share what I’m going through to anyone but my therapist because the reaction I mostly get is that my depression and anxiety are causing my chronic pain and ED and that if I just got over it, all of the symptoms would magically disappear.

I don’t even know what response I’m looking for here but just felt like I needed to post this somewhere in the world."
18x4aqw,Depression,2024-01-02,Vent,"Just fucking tired.

I don't need anyone to tell me it gets better or anything like that. I already know how life works. I've been managing this shit for over 20 years now.

I'm not ignorant to the fact there are beautiful things in life. The ups and downs Yada yada.

I'm just tired of not being normal. I'm tired of always being the weird one. I'm tired of every single fucking thing I do giving away that I'm different. That my childhood was different. My first marriage. Pregnancy. Because of so many life circumstances that were out of my control or done at a young age because you do what you know and know what you see. And I knew all the wrong ways to do most everything. 

I'm tired of having to try so fucking hard to do things others do easily. I'm tired of being the nice one and being treated like shit. I'm tired of having to shove myself into things that other people are easily accepted into.

I'm tired of never feeling good enough. 

Tired of caring about what people think. Tired of being too tired to have friendships or be present in the few relationships I have in life. I'm tired of being in the same God damn state my whole fucking life. I'm tired of being poor. I'm tired of renting and moving amd renting and moving repeat repeat repeat repeat. I'm tired of not having any older family members to talk to.

I'm tired of wanting to punch a hole in everything when really all I want to do is cry and not be a part of this shit hole system we have built for ourselves. I'm tired of living to be a corporate slave just to not be on the streets. I'm tired of trying so hard and not being acknowledged.

I'm tired of dragging down the people I love the most. 

Fucking exhausted. Vent done. I'm tired of venting. But I'm glad everyone else in the house has what they need. I hope its enough. It has to be."

No one likes me. Not my sister not my ex?/bf, not anyone that bullied me my whole childhood. I’m so alone. I hate the world. I was trying so hard. I did everything and he never treated me like I was a person let alone the girl of his dreams. I’ll never be anyone’s dream I’m too ugly and fat and annoying. I hate myself, he knew I hated myself and he still obsessed over porn stars and dmed them and “cheated”. He’s still begging for me back. After I’ve give him endless chances. He doesn’t even want me. I don’t wanna be here anymore. I don’t wanna go back to school. I don’t want to be in this stupid fat black prison of a body I’ve made. I hate everything and everyone, myself, yet I still feel like I’d drop to my knees and worship the next man that give me a drop of attention. I just wanted to feel safe but instead I changed my whole personality and neglected my needs for someone that never wanted me. My life is worse than it was when I was cutting myself and thinking it couldn’t get any worse. I’d do anything just to be held and told lies again."

18x2tv4,Depression,2024-01-02,Think I’m done,"There’s something wrong with how I interpret the world and it’s gotten worse as I’ve gotten older to the point I can’t connect with anyone anymore. I don’t know who I am anymore I’m constantly fighting with this demon in my mind that tells me I’m worthless and everyone hates me and worse things like everyone knows what I’m thinking at all times and uses my thoughts and feelings to hurt me. 

It feeds on negativity and I have to try so hard to be positive and then it’s ok but it’s so hard to do it and it makes me pay for it.

I get no joy. Only fleeting moments of relief. I’m having to fight so hard, too hard. I think I’ve had enough as I know things are only going to keep getting worse as my mental and physical health deteriorates. 

Even when I do feel ok it’s just a countdown until one thing knocks me off. And it can be anything. So I’m apprehensive of everything.

I just want to make sure I’ve got money to transfer over to take the edge off and that’s coming soon."
18x2lmh,Depression,2024-01-02,Thought I was dying and didn't care,Last night I had a panic attack and it was only my second one ever so I couldn't recognize it immediately and thought I was dying at first. I've been having lots of health issues lately so I figured something just caught up with me finally cause my doctor doesn't care about investigating anything. So I felt impending doom and thought I was having a heart attack and all that and eventually when it wouldn't subside after an hour I just accepted that I was probably dying and it didn't matter. A lot of my health problems seem serious but not serious enough to go to the ER so I usually stay home for things that I should go to the ER for cause I don't know what normal bad health stuff is because I experience it all the time. Just extra depressing to realize I didn't care if I lived or died.

I turned on some music and sliced my wrist open. I didn't faint this time. I watched blood leave my body and drip onto the floor. I felt relieved. Sat down and just watched blood drip. Something is really wrong with me. I went to the roof again. Took off my shoes so i dont hang in there awkwardly when i try to jump. I just stood there, looking at the fireworks while blood was dripping. I had a really provoking thought to jump. But i didn't want to. I went back home. Sliced my other wrist and just sat there, now watching 2 streams of blood. After the bleeding stopped i went in the bathroom and washed my hands. I didn't care enough to clean my floor. And now I'm here, writing this post and still thinking that i should have jumped.

How do i stop?"

4 days have passed, yet I feel nothing but guilt and regret from leaving my perfect reality. I woke up crying and in disbelief. WHY CAN'T LIFE BE LIKE THAT?????????

It hurts so much, and after years of not feeling this way, I'm currently thinking/planning to take my own life before it gets much worse. Death may hurt but this feeling hurts much more.

I am a monster, I feel like I deserve everything that happens to me... I don't feel pleasure from anything anymore. My deceased grandpa would see me with utter disgust right now, no matter what anyone says.

I am ungrateful. I may have a job, and may have an university degree. But I'm utterly useless and everyone proved that to me.

I should die. I have to die. I need to die.

I'm starting to plan on how the this and next week will go by. My best friend wants to see me this week so that may be the chance I have to say goodbye to her.

I want 2024 to be different than 2023 and 2022 and all the other stress-inducing years. It can't work that way. Try and try to take steps to be happier but in the end the only way for me to reduce stress is to avoid others. To be solitary. I cannot stand people. Not all people but a huge chunk of them. I am not perfect, I have many flaws but it is tiring being around others especially in public who perceive themselves as flawless. Everyone has that same attitude—arrogant, smug, spiteful. This will sound weirdly worded but I guess you can say they think their ""shit don't stank"", if you get what I'm putting down. When you are ugly you are never allowed to let your guard down. Everyone will let you know you are ugly, whether vocally or by actions. They gain from your pain and misery. No matter what you do—be nice, be mean. Be open, be distant. Be around others, keep to yourself, you are judged and nothing is good enough. 

I hope, keyword: hope, this year can be better than last year. In 2023 itself I've endured so much on my plate day and day while I was already not in a good mood. Being talked about, the microaggressions. The laughter. The ""eewws"" in public. The comments and more. From people who think they are better than others.

The only friend i have left is a guy that is just always overdosing and the only reason he is my friend is quite becouse he himself dosent have any

Every one of my family members has gave up on me and i myself did the same

Ive had a really fucked up childhood filled with abuse and parents that werent mentaly well enough to take care of me and my siblings, my brother later got into a big drug problem wich kinda draged me into it, for me pills and alcohol mainly, but he was using coke, speed, weed, fethanyl.. well really whatever he could get his hands on and us being in a same room i had to watch him snort coke literally in front if me as a child, ive grew up very inpusive and unable to control my emotions in any ither way than s-h, i would bang my had against a wall, hut myself until a black spot would form and i just started using a blade not long ago wich didint end well at all

Im pretty sure i have adhd but its not diagnosed so i cant focus on my school work at all and im failing every one of my classes

I really just lost all the feelings, im emotianaly numb and i cant even feel sorry for myself becouse i know that isnt gonna get me anywhere or help in any way, ive accepted my reality and i know nothing is gonna be better

I just want to rest with my older sister. She also committed suicide 6 months ago and from there i snapped.

I started doing self harm, developed an addiction to pain and now i attempted suicide 4 times already, with one attempt being an hour ago or so. A shoelace saved my miserable life when i tried to jump from 25 stories. I don't want no fucking creature or thing to save me from achieving peace. 
I am overdosing on antidepressants. They still don't help and drive me into more bad memories and suicidal thoughts. I can't even go to my therapist anymore because my mom thinks that they will do nothing to save me. I literally cut open an artery and survived. Like what the actual dipping shit do i have to do to stop existing?
I went to my local playground at New years eve. I called the police because I probably need to dispose of my body somehow so young kids won't be traumatized. I stabbed myself really hard and boom-i am at the hospital once again, after some surgery or whatever, almost perfectly fine. I started crying. Not because i was in pain, not because i felt bad. I cried because I was still alive. I didn't want that.
Now there is a giant scar on my chest and i am scared of PE class because i might get punished and expelled.
I hated myself so much that i broke my mirror and, guess what? Sliced the SAME WRIST as always. AND i am still alive after 3 bandaids.

I got in college and dropped out because it was making my social anxiety consume me alive. I get a job and I drop out because of my social anxiety. I lost almost all of my friends because I never want to hang out and because I'm always super distant. I looked for online jobs I could do but I only made a couple of bucks from  them. It's like nothing works out, it's like I was not supossed to be alive. I feel like I was a mistake,the universe accidently made me be here and now has no purpose for me. 
I'm just so tired"
18x0b6g,Depression,2024-01-02,I feel stuck in my own head and have never been so depressed,"23 (F) and I feel like I’m losing it. I’m beyond depressed and can’t get a hold of my own emotions. I used to go the gym everyday, eat good, showered multiple times a day and did a bunch of self care things. It takes all the energy in the world for me to even take a shower now. 

I don’t know why I’m so depressed, I have so much to be happy about. I have a great family, I don’t have friends but a great boyfriend who loves me dearly and our perfect animals. 

I quit smoking weed a month ago and that’s been a tough one. The only thing that makes me feel better is drinking a lot which has to stop because my liver enzymes are fucked because of it. I also have embarrassed myself by just crying a bunch while I drink out in social situations because I am just losing it.

My dad recently tried to kill himself and I thought he was dead because I could see him through his window and he wasn’t moving despite how much I banged on the window. I had to call 911 and the ambulance had to break in the door. I thought he was dead for sure, his blood pressure was 40/27 at the time the paramedics arrived. He was in the hospital for a while and I’m still having a hard time getting over that whole scenario. 

I’m just not excited about anything when I should be so grateful. I hate my mind SO much and I don’t know what to do. This is a vent more or less but I just need someone to talk to"
18x03xb,Depression,2024-01-02,You’re not thankful enough,"the things people say who don’t understand depression is harsh and hurts me even deeper
when they tell you how you’re not thankful enough even though it feels like i’m staring at my life through a glass wall and can’t reach right now 
i’m checked out and living in my head not realizing everyday feels like a haze i wake up do stuff and can’t wait to sleep again until it repeats 
i quit alcohol, I have what i need and want, and i’m told that i’m such a spoiled child and when i don’t get handed what i want is the reason i’m depressed
To me it’s like i am thankful, i see what i have, i enjoy what i do sometimes, i love my family, i love things about myself but there’s something inside me that is pulled away and detached like a fragmented part of me that doesn’t count and shouldn’t be shown, a lot of it can be from trauma but depression is a experience in our heads and bodies regardless if we have great things around us or not, or how people question how could we be depressed when we have everything we need and want but it’s hard to put in words when you see it but you feel so empty about it at the same time, you accept it’s there but you don’t feel it in your being, you just are so locked in a mental state that you feel desperate to escape that you depend on others to bring you back to life and only then when you open your vulnerabilities you are taking a risk of them hurting you even more"

18wzmz2,Depression,2024-01-02,I think I found a way to stop crying fits,"So I have major depression, I've had it for forever and recently my mom got diagnosed with dementia (relevant). This morning it hit me that this holiday season may be the last that she is mentally present. I've already been really depressed and pushing myself to keep going, I guess this was just the last straw and I started crying hysterically. I calmed down to get to work but I was still sad and started crying on and off again, pretty normal for me when I'm in the depths of my depression. 

Well I'm walking back from my cry session in the bathroom and one of my male coworkers noticed I was upset. We talk briefly about what's going on, ofc I cry more, but then dude takes the hardest left turn. All of a sudden he's asking about my relationship and then starts talking about how cheating is inevitable and you can't just leave someone, especially if you've been together for years, even if they cheated. Idk how we didn't get in trouble but we legitimately were debating this idea for almost 2 hours straight. 

I doubt he actually said all this to distract me from my problems bc he tends to be hella out of pocket regularly and likes to be controversial. However thank God he said it bc now I've just been hyper fixated on this debate and talking with my other coworkers about how outlandish this idea is. Like I never thought I'd say my day was made by someone trying to convince me that cheating is okay and something that can be condoned. My boyfriend and I joked on the phone at lunch that maybe from now on if I'm sad or mad that he should say something really out there like 'All elephants are homosexuals' lol. Honestly I think it may work too bc I can't stop talking about it (if this post isn't enough evidence for that lol). So yeah, I'd love to hear if anyone has found success in a similar method. I probably will never update regarding if it works, but I'm fairly positive it will. I do tend to hyperfixate on stuff, part of the reason why I get into my crying fits. Up until now I've never found a good way to change my fixation, even music or work or fun activities can stop it. Yet debating cheating did it xD"

18wylj5,Depression,2024-01-02,Just feeling so so empty,"Every felt that empty before?

Like you're sipping on tea and life is passing you by

It smirks and changes the surroundings

But you just wither away. 


It bounces and hugs the world forward

But you're the one that got away

""Life is about reading between the lines""

But what do you do if the lines blur over?

If the words walk around your brain

If your emotions are chained in your heart

Are you alive or a living corpse

That's only bothered by morbid thoughts.


Your friends gradually leave your side

And there are now boulders where your hobbies lied

You're an empty person on an empty road

Going nowhere and with nothing to say

Your tears once made bed your cheeks

Now they too are bored,

running down their routine way. 


To make eye contact 

Is to look in the eyes of a devil

If that devil is the reflection I see

Of the empty person that once used to be

Cheerful, funny and smart 

A good artist, and kind at heart

A fit body with a clear voice

A group of friends who enjoyed my presence in all my days. 


Now who am I and why am I

If the road was to turn left 

Why am I walking right?

I'm crumbling again and there's no one who'll know

The water level is finally rising above my nose

I can't sit still But I can't get up

So I'll just be quiet and bide my time

Trying to enjoy this empty life.

I really need help! 

I know I have the potential of being productive and be better than this, but since I have a job at a restaurant, I have no routine, no structure, I’ve been oversleeping every day, and sleeping is pretty much all I think about. I wake up about noon everyday and I just go to work and that’s all I do. 
How do you all fight this? 

I have to study, I have to clean, I often start projects or things and never finish it.

18wy8oo,Depression,2024-01-02,The good thing about memory loss,"You probably that this condition is more or less spread among depressed people. In my case, it's not strictly *memory loss* as in ""I can't remember a specific event or period of my life"", it's more like every single experience I've had since I remember being depressed appears meaningless and not worthy to be recalled in any way. 

It happens for both negative and positive things: i.e. when a friend mentions some detail about their life they have shared previously with our group of friends, it sounds new to me, while the others remember that thing quickly and even recall that conversation in which that detail came up; however, I don't remember any argument I had with teachers in high school, despite some of them, as a friend of mine said, were very heated (and high school is where I spent most of my time for the past 5 years). The memories of my therapy sessions are so blurred that I stopped going there on a whim after a ""break"" of 3 months, after which I should have had to start again, because I just feel they left me nothing, no new knowledge about myself, no new ways of coping.

 All the memories of conversations I had, experiences I lived, books I read, papers I studied form an indistinct mass in my head, as if there is no memory that I consider more important than like tying my shoes this morning. Yeah, as I described it, it seems a hopeless scenario, but with this knowledge in mind I can't buy that crap of ""living to make memories to remember when you are old"", as I have given up on beating depression, nor I want to make it past my 70s. 

Just a positive little thing I noticed: you can't have regrets for missing out on something when even if it happened it's like you never lived it either way. "

The girls I try to talk to either run away after my first sentence as if they saw a monster or make fun of me. I know I'm ugly but I didn't think I was extremely ugly but maybe I'm seeing myself wrong, maybe I look really horrible. I went bald because of my betting addiction. I've been shaving my head with a razor for the last month but I think I look even worse that way, I feel like people are laughing at me, making fun of me.  
  
I live alone in a house that my sister and I inherited. I was looking for a roommate, and from the local website forum I found out that he is a heroin addict. I blocked him at first, but actually the most logical thing would be to take him as a roommate and then hit gold with heroin.

18wxoyi,Depression,2024-01-02,I’m having the hardest time letting him go. I’m in a severe depressive episode.. (rejection sensitive),"I was rejected by someone I truly liked... did things start out great in the beginning? No... I had my guard up and I even told him that I just wanted to be a placeholder until he found someone else.


 He challenged me on that and he didn't want that
There's a lot I ended up liking about him. He was emotionally intelligent, intelligent, level headed... he met all my craziness with logic.. he wasn't afraid to tell me things like one truth ""you really need to take some time to work on yourself""... I really did... I gave him a hard time and red flags


We went on a date and I liked him... he was polite and a gentleman. He asked me what's on my mind a lot ... I was nervous a bit... but I still just loved being in his company. He did ask when I was last intimate with someone.. I think I did mention that I wanted to possible wait until marriage

I thought everything was fine and he ghosted me.

Fast forward .. I sent him an emotional message. He called me... he said he didn't want to invest his time if we weren't going to eventually have sex. He said we can check in every now and then.... He said he hopes I find a man who loves me the way I need.

This all stabbed me in the heart.

haven't cleaned, left my bed, ate.... I feel so not good enough.. I asked if he wasn't attracted to me.. he said
""you're perfect, nothing is wrong with you""
""Then why don't you want me"" I was crying"

18wxho2,Depression,2024-01-02,Idk what I'm doing and who tf I am,"I don't even know where to start 
I'm 18m, gonna be 19 next month. I've been suffering from depression for a few years now. No idea where it started, but it could have started in primary school where I've been bullied for some time. I was a little bit nerdy back then, video games and computer was my world. Some kids would basically gang up on me, and say some shit, or push me around. I'm pretty skinny, so back then I couldn't defend myself so I just tried to ignore it I guess. FWR to high school- when I was 14 I had my first beer, and my first blackout, so alcohol wasn't sth strange to me. I started drinking and hanging out with some much older and bad people when I was 16, I have taken more substances, than you probably could count, that's when I started doing some bad things, and some poor choices got me stabbed in the stomach when I was 17 (nothing serious, it was more of a scratch than a stab). I've been clean for 1.5 year from any substances now the only thing that I've been smoking is grass practically daily from the day I stopped running with this people and taking drugs, I don't drink hard alcohol either, I'm fine with beer. My drinking and taking drugs was so severe, that I have like a 3 month gap where I don't know what I was doing and what had happened. I don't have any hobby, now I'm trying to get into one, but idk if it will work out, the only thing I was doing for the past few years was going out, drinking, taking drugs and playing video games. I'm more if a extrovert, basically always smiling and joking around my now best bud was shocked when I told him about my past, I'm not into fights, I'd rather talk with someone that has a problem with me, but I learned to fight and will do it when must. I know very many people, but just a few of them really cares what's going on with me, and know my backstory. About my parents, they weren't really supportive of me from when I was a kind and aren't now, for example; whenever I got a bad grade they would just yell at me, but when it was good it was more like an ,,OK, good"" and that's all, never really supported what I did, and what I liked  when I played video games when I was a kid, they would yell at me for just trying to get some fun, and took away my computer often. I'm on psychotherapy now, but the only thing this guy does is basically trying to get me on meds, and I don't want that because of my previous drug problem.
But enough of the background. I've been feeling worse and worse for some time now, the only thing that I'm hearing from my mom is ,,get a hold of yourself "". I can't take this all anymore, I'm just laying in bed trying to shut down my thoughts, but I can't, I don't feel any emotions anymore except for hate towards everything, I can't really think about a single happy thing happening to me for the past few months, I have been having suicidal thoughts really often now, idk what to do, who I am, wtf I'm doing here and who to ask, so I just wrote it down here."

I have suffered with erectile dysfunction for years and have been to urologists many times with little success.

Caverject did not help solve the issue and my tadalafil is not working as well as it used to.

It all began when I was 14 and stopped waking up with morning erections. I really wish I could get these back as I believe this would greatly help to increase the issue

18wwkge,Depression,2024-01-02,I’m always scared,"First time posting here so not sure if this has been discussed but I need to rant a bit. 
I’m in my 4th year of uni and I've been struggling with depression on and off since I was 15. Last year (January 2023) was the worst in that sense. I almost tried to take my own life and I don’t think I’ve ever been in a worse place.
Now I’m much better, I haven’t had suicidal thoughts in a while or panic attacks. But I am so so scared. Every time I have a bad day and feel sad or low, I am so anxious about the depression being back. Now that we’re nearing the anniversary of the day I tried to commit suicide, I feel so worried. January-February were always the months I struggled with most every year, so I feel really alert at any signs that my mood is getting lower. I feel like for a normal person a bad day is just a bad day, but for me it is so much more than that. It can never just be that, I am always worried its the start of a spiral. Does this ever go away?
Man, it gets so tiring. I have to keep checking I’m doing everything not to fall back in there (eating well, sleeping, socialising, getting sunlight, exercising, resting) and I’m just so tired of always being alert for any signs of depression. Do you experience this?"
18wweab,Depression,2024-01-02,Ive set a date for my suicide,"Strangely, feels vaguely freeing. 

I get to live as freely as I choose for the next couple months and get my things in order. The way I've organized things, I don't believe I could yield another failed attempt. The only thing Im slightly worried about is changing my mind later on based on the amount of ""free living"" I've achieved. I know I'm setting this date for a reason, I'm scared Im going to lose sight of that and pull further along the suffering life has to offer. I'm simply not strong enough to keep going, or so thats how it feels. When it gets bad it is unbearably bad, I have really high high's and awful lows so even when its ""good"", its just exhausting waiting for when it all goes to shit again.  

In the next few months I'm going to sell my things to get enough cash to pay for ""living experiences"" like taking a cheap trip or something and limit all my spending. Im also gifting some possessions and going to spend a lot more time with the people in my life that care about me.  Compartmentalize life into the next few months instead of rotting in bed like I always do. Getting the most of what I have left.

Its scary, I will admit. But I've been so depressed for as long as I can remember, doctors have told me I don't even realize when I'm showing symptoms cause its just my everyday. I just don't think theres any other way. 

Thanks for reading.

A family friend understood how I felt, so brought me to their country for a holiday, which I am very grateful for.  Even though it has taken some of the pressure off me and I am no longer in a depressed state, I still often wish that I was never born.

8 billion people on this planet — I really do not need to be here.  My life is completely worthless.

Now that the family friend has invested so much into helping me, I feel kind of obligated to not kill myself so as to not make them feel that it was all a waste.

I have nothing to contribute to this planet.  My degrees are worthless, I do not have any other skills, I have no money.

18wvtef,Depression,2024-01-02,Losing hope,"So I was having flashbacks from ptsd, my mother always tells me to call helplines, because she doesn’t want to comfort me. I was on a call with a helpline, this guy wasn’t responding most of the time or just saying almost nothing, and I mentioned I don’t think these calls are helping, and he starts saying “I don’t think you’re safe” in a very condescending tone, I responded with something like “what? Yes I am” he starts repeating “i don’t believe you”. He says he’s going to tell his supervisor to order an intervention, (I haven’t mentioned suicide or self harm at all). i think it’s a misunderstanding, so I try to tell him I didn’t call him an idiot and it was directed at myself, he says, “no, you said the helpline isn’t helping you”. I try to reason with him, I told him again, I am feeling safe. He says “no, you need to learn some respect, I’m going to order an intervention.” He has a condescending tone in the entire conversation from “I don’t think you’re safe”, 

it was obvious he got offended and tried to abuse his power. How fucked up does someone have to be to do this to another person who’s already vulnerable. 

I felt so upset after the call, so I went to my mother, only for her to yell at me, and push me. All I wanted was some love and comfort, just some generic it’s going to be ok would’ve been more than fine. 

People can be so cold, it’s made me lose so much hope, how can someone do this to another person? Do they seriously feel nothing? No empathy."

I had to quit my $50 000+ job which I worked hard to get because I couldn't handle it. I seem to have regressed because I can barely handle simple tasks like personal hygiene and managing household bills, etc. 

I am behind on bills and paperwork because my head can't process it all.

I used to abuse alcohol to drown my pain but I made a promise to a dear loved one to not abuse alcohol again. The only problem is, I have no coping mechanisms now that even seem to put a temporary dent in the pain. 

I just feel hopeless :("

18wv3cv,Depression,2024-01-02,What is life worth living for? Why should I wake up everyday?,"Im a 22f and I lost all motivation, cut off everyone in my life and I just lie in my bed everyday and read webcomics. I feel overwhelmed and burnt out, my neurodivergence made me fail many times. It feels like I was cursed with it before even being born. I was neglected as a child and I didnt develop safe attachment style nor healthy coping mechanisms. 4 years of therapy only made me aware of everything even more but failed to help me to cope. Meds I take help me to endure but side effects are making me miserable but its better than just suffering without them. I dont feel like Im a danger to my own life but I just dont feel any motivation since only thing that is going to happen is me struggling while going to some mediocre 9 to 5 job for the rest of my life. I hate my university. I just cant find the reason to wake up everyday. Please, tell me your perspective on that. I want to heal somehow and I dont want to be a burden to my mom whos trying to make me feel better."

I just can’t feel right, I feel perpetually “off”. My thoughts, emotions, experience of life, just feel “off”. I can no longer from conversations, I have no friends or relationships. It’s hard to describe, there is no evidence. I know the damage this “off” had done to me and the world around me. Living life like this is hell, impossible. I just want to feel and be normal, to feel and be okay as I always have. I have no trauma of any kind, as my life is easy and comfortable, I just feel “off” I have no known apparent mental disorders

I have a couple major life stressors coming up (that I already know I don't do too well with).  My meds have been working just OK lately.  I'm not actively suicidal too often, but when I am, I usually only realize how bad I'd gotten once I'm feeling a bit better again.  I don't feel actively suicidal now, but IDK what the near future holds.  If I feel my thoughts getting pretty out of control, I've been thinking of going in-patient somewhere (basically having myself committed).  I'm just worried that it would be a lot of upheaval for myself &amp; my partner for possibly very little benefit (and maybe a huge bill - haven't checked into that &amp; not feeling exceptionally motivated to do a whole lot of checking into things right now...).

18wt2ck,Depression,2024-01-02,I feel like I want to be alone,"This is going be just a vent so I’m sorry if it’s incoherent 
I (21f) feel like I want to be alone due to my depression recently. I have a partner who I love very much, but cohabiting a space with someone is just… too much I guess. I’m really easily frustrated and quick to tears/anger, I’m messy and really scatterbrained, and I can tell it’s starting to really frustrate my partner. I’ve always been like this, though, and I’m very insecure about it, and I don’t know if I even can be more mindful/less clumsy/more neat, I’ve just been this way ever since I can remember. It’s not like I’m totally dysfunctional, I have a well paying job and I do very well in my classes at university, I’m on a trajectory to be in a very profitable career and have a lot going for me, it’s just… at home.

He got frustrated with me today because I couldn’t figure out how to get his stupid piece of jewelry on and ended up asking if I was stupid. I just totally lost it and got angry at him. We haven’t argued in a long time, so that sucked. But I was so hurt because I feel like he’s right to an extent, I’m so easily frustrated with every day things, pretty much anything that isn’t school or work is hard/frustrating for me. Sometimes I wonder if I’m autistic and my career and degree are just my special interests and that’s the only reason I’m very good in that regard, because everything else is genuinely overwhelming. I worked retail for a few years before I found a job in my field, and my managers didn’t like me because I got overwhelmed and confused very easily. 

It just sucks. I want to push everyone out so that I can just be a dysfunctional mess that has a messy apartment and cries over simple tasks on my own, and I don’t have someone in my ear getting angry at me about it and just reinforcing what I already know. But I really love my partner, so I don’t want to ruin our relationship. I guess if we could just live separately that would be ideal; I don’t want to live with anyone. How I am behind closed doors is frustrating and embarrassing."

I am so fucking lonely. I have no friends at all. Just people I can talk to about random stuff, sometimes about my mental state, and coworkers, but I’m able to meet only 2 of them. 

My real life communication last months is only with these two people. 

I was thinking what is wrong with me and why am I not really important for people I know and used to call friends. 

My other coworker said that he thinks the main problem is that I am too depressed. People don’t want to talk to me because there is no point in friendship with me. Cause I am often very quiet and sad. It is exhausting.

I am agree with him. But I am lost and confused. Because my loneliness is probably a cause of depression, and friends could be a key to healing. But there is no point for people to be friends with me.

And I have almost nobody. And people I have are getting tired of me.

I’ve been on them for over 3 weeks maybe 4 weeks I think. Today and a couple days ago I’ve been noticing some of my depression symptoms I guess you could say coming back and I get into a really bad mental space. And when I do I get the need to stop taking my anti depressants and get back to the worst state I was in because I want to have the courage to kms like I did then.

Furthermore, I’m literally so exhausted from studying and my grades are shit. I used to be top student n now I’m nothing. I hurt , beat , and torture myself (starving/ slapping/scratchjng) but never had the guts to cut. It’s like I wanna hurt myself but not tat bad

Plus I hide all these from my friends because I don’t wan them to see me as needy and I don’t like being the one with problems . Plus I struggle with intense fomo or jealousy. It’s just a thing. N I feel left out even tho I’m the most popular in my group. My best friend always loves posting pictures with the group and purposely cut me out or not have me in the pic which makes me sad

And my parents have been arguing a lot and I get stressed because I feel like their parent alot and I never had a proper childhood cuz I was the oldest and grew up fast and matured faster.

With all these problems I feel like I wanna pause time n disappear, kinda like suicide but I don’t have the guts to because I have a younger sister and family who will be very sad. And when I ask someone to talk to me , they just talk but then I don’t respond which is kinda stupid.

18wrgqu,Depression,2024-01-02,I hate this time of year,"I hate this time of year; the holidays are over, my business grinds to a halt, the weather is cold and snowy, money is tight and we can't pay all our bills and creditors are calling. I don't know what to do. I'm paralyzed when it comes to the debt issue, I know I should reach out to my creditors and explain things, but I just ignore it. Block calls, ignore collection notices. We declared bankruptcy in 2021 and dug ourselves back into the debt hole again with credit cards.

My brain starts obsessing over how bleak everything is. I had COVID again last month and I'm still with being sick from it. My sinuses are full of green crap, I'm coughing all the time, my chest gets tight and feels like I can't breathe, but my O2 levels are okay. I was put on Prednisone last week at urgent care because my sinuses were so bad, now I'm tapering off and my entire body hurts.

I'm 58 with multiple serious health concerns, including mastocytosis, fibromyalgia, arthritis, interstitial cystitis, depression, PTSD, anxiety. I have go to the Mayo Clinic regularly for treatment in an FDA drug trial. Some days, like today, I couldn't sleep all night and ended throwing up after I gave up trying to sleep. I have to take over 20 pills per day just to try to maintain where I'm at and they cost so much.

I need to earn money, try to get back into the workforce, but how do I do that with  everything. My office skills are so outdated, it isn't funny. I am selfless as a pet care professional. Been doing that since I was laid off in 2008. Got a college degree, can type, so what?

My husband is literally working himself to ruin at a job requiring hard physical labor. He is in constant pain from his hand and knees. He's the only thing keeping a roof over our heads. I feel so fucking awful.

I can feel the depression today, climbing into my brain. Making me feel useless, making me want to just not feel anything. Last time I was really suicidal was December 2019, it was bad. I had everything planned out, where and how to do it. I don't want to go there again. I don't know how many time I can pull back from that.

I'm on an antidepressant. Can't afford going back into therapy, copay of $30 is that tight now. How do I hang on?"
18wqwsm,Depression,2024-01-02,I can't see a future for myself.,"Honestly, I've never seen a future for myself. In my 20s I had convinced myself I wouldn't make it into my 30s and I never made any plans or set any goals for myself.

Now I'm almost 4 years into my 30s and I can't help feeling like a child. I still live with my mom, I'm comfortable with the situation, we get along very well, and we respect each others privacy while still hanging out together. But still, even though I don't care about moving out, it still makes me feel like a failure.

But not as much as when I think about my finances. I never went to college and I've held several different jobs over the years but I have no savings to speak of. In fact I have -$16k to my name due to credit card debt. I have a bad habit of impulse/emotional buying and now that I have two nearly maxed out cards, its finally catching up to me.

But perhaps the thing that bothers me the most is the fact that I've never been in a relationship. Not once in all my life have I been on a date or been close to someone in a romantic sense. I'll admit that this is a self inflicted struggle, I don't leave my house except for work or shopping. A part of me had always assumed that love would just one day find me, as I had seen happen to so many others in my life.

When I look to my future, I can only see more darkness and sadness. I can't even imagine what turning my life around would look like. I feel like if I had a partner to support me, to hold me and say they love me despite my fuck ups, well it wouldn't change much but it would make things easier to cope with.

Everyday I fall deeper into despair and ending it all seems like a more reasonable option. One day my friends will get their shit together and I won't get to see them. One day my cats, my emotional rocks, will die and I'll have no one to hold when I feel lonely. One day my money will run out and I won't be able to pay my bills. One day my mom will die and I won't know how to support myself.

I want to be better but I don't know what ""better"" looks like.

Where would I start?

What kind of future can I hope for?

Can someone who's as messed up as me even have hope for a future?"

The thought of me swallowing a ton of pills and then shooting myself in the head is such a heartbreaking scene. Just to imagine myself in that state and the trauma of the person who found me, in addition to how crushed and traumatized my parents and my boyfriend would be, it just seems like an overwhelmingly devastating situation that I don’t want to happen.  So I’m begging for some encouragement in my battle with depression. I don’t know how to stop experiencing those awful pits where the hurts of my past resurface themselves and make me miserable as they all come down on me at once. I know that everyone has been hurt before, and I know others likely have it worse. I have a roof over my head, a job, a car, I’m in college, I eat everyday and don’t worry too much about it, I have no kids depending on me, I live with my parents so I don’t have to pay any bills except tuition and car insurance, I have no reason to feel this way. But I can’t stop my brain from dwelling on hurt from my past with all of the verbal and emotional abuse from my parents, heartbreak from when people that I thought loved me ended up cutting me out of their lives, all of the cruel things people have said to me, unfair things that have happened to me- small things that normal people can get over. But I can’t. It consumes me and eats away at me. I cry every day, sometimes for hours. I hate this. I hate living. But dying by suicide seems worse somehow. So I’m begging, for the sake of me not destroying my parents and my boyfriend, can someone please offer some encouragement."

To stay blessed, you must be blessed.
What is being blessed?
Having lots of money, a financially stable family?
What if, your family is financially stable, but not mentally stable?
What if, you have a family that is neither financially stable or mentally stable. Then what? You just have a family.
But I guess that's still, ""blessed"".
Now what if you're the black sheep. And everyone around you seems to be fine. Not noticing that you're so far behind. That you can hardly sit for one minute without having a thought of ending it all? That you're hardly able to sit and have a rational conversation, with anybody for that matter, without being paranoid that they are against you. Are you able to sit an not scan the room for a way out? You're no tactical ex military so what the f7ck are you doing that? Because you wanna see all your options in case you have to make an exit plan to finish it. 
Do you see that rusty nail sticking out of the wall? You can easily thrust your arm against it and rip it down your forearm. 
Do you see the high ceiling? Where can hang from.
Do you see the cleaning products, that would suck to have swallowed too much.
There's always an exit plan.

I'll miss my pets, I am gonna miss out on TV shows and new tech innovations. Damn, I'll sure miss a lotta things. 

Also... Are there any sewicide methods groups that you might know of?"
18wotbk,Depression,2024-01-02,I can't do anything. I lost myself.,"I feel anxious and depressed. Yeah. It's no surprise.

 I've been crying a lot like a lot too. I spent my last December crying, panicking. 
I think it's too late. Too late to do anything. I'm 24 by the way. People say I'm young but I don't know how to manage this disaster. 

I couldn't do anything in 2023 because I was so burnt out. I couldn't get back on my feet. I wish things were different. 

It's January, 2024 and you know, it's so frightening and scary somehow. I feel like I walk on shattered glass. Now everything seems too difficult for me. My goal has become Unreachable.

I didn't do anything today. I just slept for 4 hours again in daylight like old people. Am I going to die soon?

I lost all the hopes and dreams. I seriously don't that. I don't to die like that but..... I don't know. I don't have the will."
18wosv5,Depression,2024-01-02,Am I being affected by my depression and meds or has p*rn ruined me?,"I genuinely have no idea where to post this to get some actual advice on this matter, so sorry if this isn’t the place (suggestions appreciated).

I am a 26 year male and have been in a straight relationship for the past two years. When we first met, we fucked like rabbits, however, now I have a problem to get excited for sex and even for porn for that matter, unless it’s a transgender porno. Which led to me to believe that porn might have affected my sexual orientation to the point, where I can’t seem to get excited for anything anymore. I used to fap exclusively to girls and lesbian porn and I still do sometimes, but then I discovered girls with penises and everything changed.

We don’t have sex anymore because I just can’t get excited for it. I’m not horny. Hell, I don’t even masturbate as much as I used to anymore. I used to fap every single day when I was single. Now I do about once a month.

What worries me is the fact, that the only thing that gets me little bit excited, is the transgender porn. I’m worried that it turned me gay, because I can only get off to girls with penises.

But what’s even weirder is that I’m genuinely in love with my gf and I don’t find guys attractive in the same way I find girl attractive. It’s only the porn. The idea of being intimate with a guy is off putting.

What I’m trying to say is that I’m very confused and not sure what to do.

I should also mention, that I have been on heavy antidepressants for the past five years, which is about the same time I stopped fapping daily. So it would also make sense that it’s the medication, that makes me have 0 libido and horniness and it was just the initial burst of horny that made us fuck like rabbits, when we first met. I am in the process pf lowering my dosage, but I feel no change yet.

Did porn fuck me up? I only fap once a month though, so i basically nofap 6 months a year. Is it the antidepressants? I don’t know. I want to have sex again, but I don’t feel horny."
18wor7g,Depression,2024-01-02,Emotional and now facing numb and emptiness,"I always knew I had depression for like 10 years already. Sometimes it was ok and sometimes it was really bad but I somehow still managed until today. 2023 felt like the first time I could say „hey I think I’m not depressed anymore and finally have everything more under control“ - but shit just went downhill like I’ve been to hell with my emotions. I even started with therapy for the very first time but that only triggered more emotions and memories i thought I was over.

My emotions have now been on a roller coaster for the past 3 months from super high to rock bottom and for a month it’s like it’s been on a free fall tower. I‘m usually not a person who cries. The last time I remembered crying my heart out was more than 10 years ago. But I’ve been crying for a week in December. Crying, numb, crying, numb. 
And now I’m just feeling constantly detached from everything while it feels like my soul is broken. I even want to cry but it just feels empty while my mind feels like going crazy but at the same time not because I feel detached from life. 

Can someone relate? Or does anyone of you have a solution? My next therapy appointment is in 2 weeks which feels like an eternity and I’m not sure if it going to help but I guess it’s something"
18woqwc,Depression,2024-01-02,"My boyfriend has depression, do I stay or leave?","I (F24) desperately need some advice on what to do here. My boyfriend (M29) and I were together 6 months but had been friends 3 years prior to being together. I knew he suffered from anxiety and some depression but in the last 2 months of our relationship it’s been really bad, like nothing I’ve seen before.

In these last 2 months he’s really withdrawn from the relationship, neglecting me and made no effort whatsoever, constantly pushing me away and honestly treating me like shit. He kept promising things will get better and they just don’t. This isn’t the first time I’ve seen him struggle with this, the difference is how long this has lasted without him seeming to recover at all. 

 I made the decision to end the relationship because it was taking such a toll on me and made me anxious all the time. I just found myself absolutely miserable all of the time. 

My ex before him suffered from bipolar and severe mental illness and I was with him for 4 years but it took such a toll on me and always came at an expense to my happiness which is why I didn’t want to relive this. 

I know that I have no idea what it is he’s going through and I acknowledge that I never will understand which is why I need advice from people who do understand his pain. 

I love this man more than I have ever loved anyone in my life. I’m the type of person who will fight, the problem is I don’t know when to quit and would rip myself apart for the person I love. We have been in contact and it’s been messy. He’s completely withdrawn and refuses to communicate but I know this man really does love me which is why I don’t understand why he keeps hurting me.

Since I’ve broken up with him he’s been almost angry and resentful in a way. I’ve had a good think about it from his perspective and what he may be experiencing and I think it could be that he feels abandoned by me because I’ve left him while he’s at his absolute lowest.

He’s really struggling with communication so do I need to let him know that I acknowledge that hurt and feeling of abandonment?

I guess I just need to know whether I’m a bad person for putting myself first here. Did I do the wrong thing by ending it when he needed me the most? He keeps pushing me away, so do I keep fighting here or will that make it worse?"

18wnsfr,Depression,2024-01-02,40M - I don't know if I can take another 30 years of this,"Hello all, writing this to vent a little.  


I'm a 40M white male, from Europe. I pretty much conform with the ideal standard - married with a lovely woman, 1 beautiful kid, 2 dogs, 1 house, good job with nice paycheck, etc.  


However, looking at all of this, I feel ""trapped"" in a life that I'm not sure I really want - don't get me wrong, I love my family and everything we've achieved so far, but, at the same time, I feel that I'm in a dreadful routine where I'm expected to spend the majority of my life working a 9am-6pm job, then house chores and sleep only to repeat the same the day after. Weekends there are always things to do around the house (tend the garden, DIY, etc) and it feels that I never stop.  


Ultimately, I feel like I'm trapped in my own life and I cannot be ""me"", always expected to be ""productive"", ""effective"", have all the answers, do the work, never stop, never pause, always churning, always working like an effective little ant, needing to provide and be useful in order to guarantee my place in society and in life, with my only reward being my retirement, where I will be allowed to somewhat be idle and ""enjoy life"", something that possibly will not happen considering my current health issues.  


Looking at where I am right now, I'm not sure I can take another 30 years until I'm able to enjoy life and get out of this ""vicious"" cycle of needing to ""work"" constantly in order to be worthy of having a life.  


Just needed to put this out there and vent, since I feel like I'm becoming a drone in my own life, unable to feel free in some capacity or measure."

Now I feel like I can’t escape people mentioning it. It’s a big thing that happened and I really hate myself for it and people have judged me a lot. I feel like a terrible person and maybe it was my mindset that made it all worse but I feel so alone and now I want to die because I don’t think I can recover from it. I think about it all the time and what people think. I feel like I’ve caused a lot of problems too because of it. It’s seriously bad and I have nothing going for me right now. I’m young but I feel so unloved. I have no family or friends to talk to about it. I have no one and it sucks. Maybe I should die in a couple of weeks because there’s no help or hope for someone like me. Trust me I’ve tried for years.

18wn4gl,Depression,2024-01-02,Depressing chat with boyfriend,"For the past couple weeks it hasn't been unsual for my boyfriend to randomly wake me up and be crying or tell me he was crying about something but would be unclear as to what really upset him. Today I managed to get him to say I think most of what's been on his mind; mostly about how for the past couple months he hasn't felt the same spark with dating me &amp; hasn't felt the motivation to go out and do things like he used to. He kept saying he deeply cares for me and has a very deep connection with me and I know I'm just wasting his time :(
He says he doesn't know what's happened, I know that I took a vibrant human being and dragged them down to my level like I always do. I guess I just wait for someone to talk sense into him &amp; for him to break up with me? Like I've mentioned in my prior post (he doesn't know all that happened), I'm new to this country and I don't have anyone. Now I really, really don't have anyone, I don't think this is a hole I can drag myself out of anymore honestly"

no quiero seguir con esto, ya no, en verdad que creo que a mi familia le benificiaria más que yo estuviera muerta a viva

mi padre quien era el que trabajaba murió hace cuatro años y creo que me hace falta muchísimo, mi mamá tiene mal sus piernas entonces vivimos de la pensión, ya no quiero vivir, mi autoestima ya no solo de apariencia si no de literalmente toda yo está callendo poco a poco, solo soy una fracasada que solo respira come y duerme, no tengo nada para ser de utilidad, y me odio a mi misma por no ser lo suficiente para mí y mi familia, no les soy de utilidad para nada, veo como mis primos y tíos logran hacer algo con sus vidas pero yo solo me preguntó si podré si quiera seguir adelante, no saben lo frustrante que es cuando te preguntan cosas de tu educación y no saber que decirles por vergüenza de tu mismo ser, nunca he tenido un romance y veo a los únicos 3 amigos y familiares teniendolos pero yo sé que yo no podré porque soy una mierda"
18wmw7r,Depression,2024-01-02,The feeling of emptiness has become so pervasive in my life that even negative emotions evades me,"I'm in a constant feeling of emptiness for at least half a year by now. Have you ever been so rational and detached that it feels like you are a machine? As if the only thing in common you have with humans are bodily instincts and needs. My thinking recognizes that there is something wrong, but I don't feel anything about it.

&amp;#x200B;

When a person loses his ambitions, his dreams, his love, his anger, his sadness... everything that makes a person a ""person"", what is he/she? The trademark of any living creature is the instinctual fear of death, pain, of losing something important. They have the deep desire to live and evolve, reproduce, seek companionship. I don't have even that anymore...

&amp;#x200B;

Do I want to die? I don't really know. I think I just really want to cease to exist. When even life loses its will to live, existence itself becomes a painful burden. Like a caged bird that don't want to fly anymore, even if it becomes free, It's meaningless... because it does not want to be a bird any longer.

&amp;#x200B;

I used to be a programmer. I had dreams... looking at those lines full of orderly logic, it used to fill me with joy, I thought it was the most beautiful thing in the world. But now I've become decadent.... I understand the logic, I have the program in my head, but it has no meaning anymore... no emotions. It is like the difference between a home-cooked spaghetti filled with love and cold instant ramen you cooked because you have nothing else to fill your belly.

&amp;#x200B;

Even games have become the same. I can kill my enemies, erect a house, open a treasure chest, among other things... but in the end, it is meaningless... because there is no joy anymore.

&amp;#x200B;

My last attempt at salvaging the last bit of value out of this life was reading novels. Because it allowed me to see myself in the shoes of the protagonist, of living another life I can't possibly have. Alas, even that is fleeting now. I've read novels for over 10 years by now, and I'm starting to get tired. I can't finish those I started... I can't start those I've separated to read... I've become increasingly demanding of the content that can give me a tiny bit of joy, to the point where I can go over hundreds of titles before I find something barely satisfying.

&amp;#x200B;

My time is probably running out... and there is probably nothing anyone can do... nothing I can do. I don't feel sad or angry, I don't feel anything at all."

It all hurts. I hate everything, I'm so angry all the time and all it takes for it to come out is one wrong word. I'm tired of keeping it all it, but I can't let it out either.

Nobody takes me serious when I tell them how much I just want to fucking die. All I do is go to school, smoke weed, and lay in bed. Every single fucking day is the same and I can't stand it anymore, I want to rip out my fucking eyeballs. I haven't slept in 2 days and I have school in an hour, I've barely eaten in weeks because any food makes me so fucking nauseous. I'm 16 and already have 5 attempts to my name. And fuck this ""it gets better"" shit. Every time I gaslight myself into believing that horseshit it gets worse than before. I'm holding on by a thread and nobody is taking me seriously. All I can do is drink and  smoke my problems. Somehow that always makes then worse but I keep going back. My life has never been better than right now but I just feel so fucking guilty all the time and I've never been so low. How am I supposed to enjoy life when I can't even remember anything. I don't remember anything before high school. I can't even look at pictures of myself as a kid because I feel so fucking bad for that child who has to grow up to be me. The 6 year old in that picture was in active abuse. The 13 year old in that picture is still in active abuse. It took until this fucking year, this February. I've never had light, I've never seen the brighter side, and I'm never going to. I haven't felt more than content in months. There's no way out, and I'm just left here to rot in this shitty apartment with nothing to look forward to. The holidays only make it worse because everyone around me is so cheery and happy and I don't know how to do that. These people are so lucky that they have the ability to enjoy anything. I've been like this as long as I remember. I don't remember every truly feeling safe or at ease. I just want to go home wherever that is, and live a good life but that's just not an option for those like me. I'm just a poor kid going to and failing at a rich kid school, and I have no fucking college tuition, not that I'd get accepted anywhere anyway (my cousins and siblings do have tuition from my grandparents retirement but I was told I didn't get any, lmao). Every day I think I've hit rock bottom and it's a cycle. I can't do anything and I bend over backwards just to feel content and I cant even do that 98% of the time.

I think one of the worst feelings and fears is that you won’t come out of it, you won’t pull through, and also the rumination of things bothering you. It’s a scary mindset to be locked into

18wmd3r,Depression,2024-01-02,Delayed Death,"Hello again - Part of me knows that this is basically the same as just screaming into the void, but sometimes it can be helpful to do that

Anyways, I struggle a lot with massive mood swings, the cause of which my therapist and I are currently looking into together, but regardless, it’s worth noting that I am currently in what my therapist calls a manic episode, whether or not I have anything that would cause that as it’s often known is of course yet to be discovered

I bring that up because as it stands, I feel energised, a lot more than usual, and am feeling what I’m sure should be positive, but it’s corrupting my other feelings, making my emotions conflicted, and making me unreasonably angry about things out of my control

But even in saying that, about 2 weeks ago I was in a depressive state, and in the midst of a breakdown I was going to kill myself, it would have been my 4th attempt. I was going to walk into the ocean in the middle of the night, ideally without anyone knowing

And that was due to some excellent friends, far better than I deserve

But since then, all I have been feeling is the same hopelessness in finding the kind of happiness I have to watch them all have. And while I am beyond glad my friends are happy, I want to be the one that is for once

I made an agreement with one of them not to kill myself until he and I take a trip together, which we plan to do at the end of the year, and while I look forward to it deeply, I am frustrated that I am trapped in this hell until then. If I can’t be happy, I just want to die. I’m exhausted of the cycle of waking up every day, hoping I’ll finally be happy, only to go back to sleep at the end of the day disappointed yet again

I’m upset that I have to delay that. That my hands are tied. That no matter how badly I just want happiness or peace, I can have neither, now"

Oddly enough, this has been the first exam season where I actually tried, I actually tried to revise and study and do everything I was supposed to, but it was too late to have an effect. My family is also lower middle class but I’ve always wanted to study abroad, that’s why I’ve been trying harder in high school for a nice gpa to apply for scholarships and I feel like that’s so far away now. I know it’s just a semester, it’s not the end of the world but I also feel like this is where my abilities end, I got cocky in a small environment where I was the best without putting in effort so now that I’m in a prestigious school where everyone works hard and is already twice as smart as me I feel like a fraud, that I don’t deserve to be here and that I’m bottom of the barrel in this school."

after 3 till 6 months i have to try the other one anyways, but i was wondering what is suggested to start with first as Sertraline does something to serotonine and Escitalopram also does that so i dont understand why i received another SSRI that does the same thing."

By the time I found the keys I came to my senses.

Divorce, unemployment for over a year, running out of savings, oldest kid graduating &amp; 60-year-old daughter hates me. Tried reaching out to the ex because my daughter won’t talk to me… I naively reached out to my narcissistic ex tonight and she basically suggested that I give her more time with my daughter… thereby also requiring more child support which I can’t afford.

I have a girlfriend I love,  friends and family….yet I’ve never felt more alone.

Two months on antidepressants, but they don’t seem to help.

Have a great opportunity to make money but it’s a start up and it’s slow going.

Just borrowed several thousand dollars from my disabled mother just to make it to May when my son graduates.

What the difference two years makes. But I’m still here."

As a parent, I obviously do do things, like take care of my kids. I even laugh with them and smile at them and those actions are genuine, but I also force myself to do them. It's not that I'm not enjoying the time with my children, because I do. I just have an issue showing things. I'm not very empathetic and I have resting bitch face and a stoic nature naturally. I don't even know what to do to feel like a person. I don't have the money to do anything. My birthday is in two days and I have a small get together planned for it at my apartment but I've been struggling with cancelling because.. people. I don't know how to feel. I don't know what to do.

No one is there. I left my house on Sunday to go to a friend's and came back yesterday, I felt fine. Today, that's gone and I'm back in my room. I realised that things that I used to enjoy, don't give me any satisfaction or entertainment anymore and I just want to isolate myself from everyone. I have reached out to my doctor and the appointment can't come soon enough. I'm anxious about asking people for help or trying to speak to people about how I feel, I'm worried I will get a bad reaction from them. It will make me cry again and I don't think I can cry anymore.

I often find myself making decisions that I know will have negative consequences, but yet I still do them. A few months ago I got arrested and was let out a couple days later and got put on house arrest. For some reason, I feel more at ease with myself when I am facing the consequences of negative actions. It's like I want people to dislike me. I constantly find myself asking why this is. I want to live a happy and normal life but it's like every step I take to achieve that, I end up making decisions that bring me down from it. I think it's because my life is already so fucked up to the point where I don't think I have room to improve. I think I've already messed it up. I'm on house arrest. I starve myself every day intentionally with hopes to become sickly and deathly skinny. I often find myself wanting to show signs of failure in myself.

But basically my mom (49) and I (19m) were driving to a coffee shop to have lunch,  and she was asking me why i don’t talk to her anymore except for when i am driving and she is in the car. I told her that when we are home all she does is complain about me and say that what i do isn’t healthy or i make her depressed. And anytime I disagree with her she starts yelling. 

   At the moment i am not working as I leave for Navy basic in 1-2 months. But i constantly go out and I work out every day, and go out on hikes 1-2 times a week. 

But basically I told her what i said in the first paragraph, and she said, “there you go playing the victim role again.” 
  In my i’m thinking why would your son want to spend time with someone who constantly complains about how he lives his life and that I make you depressed and you tell me this at least once a week. 
  My mom has hated the fact that I enjoy staying inside reading, playing video games and not hanging out with friends. My older brother who is the middle child does the same thing except he works. And my eldest brother did the same thing when he was my age along with my middle brother.

18wk6qm,Depression,2024-01-02,Can't seem to care about anything anymore.,"I just want to start by saying that I have been through a lot, like a hell lot in my life from being outed to my parents to forced conversion therapy. And those were not the worst parts of my life, so just imagine what I have been through. You name it, I probably went through it.

Yet I always seemed to be able to brush it off and move on with my life and have the ability to keep being normally productive in my studies and career.

The past six months, however, I have been in the worst rut in my life. Even though nothing wrong has happened. Mostly started when I began this semeter at my university, everything seemed to just go wrong. My mind constantly telling me that I am failing at both uni and my career, and I just don't seem to care that much. Even if I might fail this semester or get fired from my job, I honestly just don't care.

I can't force myself to do anything in the sense of force my self to study or do my job I am just numb. Even though I used to be a really organized productive person who thrives on certainty and being in control of my life, that wasn't long ago btw that was still me at the first half of 2023.

I was diagnosed with deprssion on January 2nd of 2021 and ever since then I tried over 5 therapists 3 different meds and a psyscologist and I seem to get better for a while and then just go depressed again. But I never was in this situation that I am in right now.

I tried a new therapist that suggested honestly the most stupidest things that would not work for me and would also not work for almost anyone in my situation in the country I lived in. And the other therapists in my country are not all that good, I tried most of the good ones only one last good therapist left and I honestly don't have any high hopes.

I don't know what I should do.

Any advice?"
18wk2j5,Depression,2024-01-02,Failed attempt,"So about a year and a half ago I had bought a shotgun and was ready to end it all. I had gotten out of the Army about a year before that. I thought life was going to be this amazing thing once I got out but I was very wrong. I developed really bad anxiety disorders and had terrible stomach problems. So I hit rock bottom, I purchased a shotgun, loaded it (or at least I thought I did), sat in my tub and put it in my mouth. I had it in there for a few minutes before I pulled the trigger. Once I did, I didn’t know if I was alive anymore. Once I realized I was I ended up throwing up and putting my shotgun away. Most people who have failed attempts will say they instantly regretted even trying. I regretted that I failed. I still do. I haven’t had the courage to pull the trigger ever since then. I curse my past self for not being able to go through with it. I can’t stand my life, it’s not a bad life but I can’t bear to live in this world any longer. But I can’t muster up the strength to even try to kill myself again. I fantasize about dying every day. Maybe a car will take me out on the side walk or maybe my house would just collapse on top of me and crush me to death. One of my friends had passed away recently and the only thing I could think of was being jealous that he died in a painless way. Another family member had just died and it’s so hard to feel sadness for them when I wish I could just give my life for theirs. I wish I could just flip an off switch and end it all but I can’t. I had my moment and I ruined it. I just can’t fucking do it anymore, all of this, everything is just bullshit."
18wk1iz,Depression,2024-01-02,Life experience,"Life gains a richer hue when I focus on myself, yet the simple act of holding a pencil sparks a realization – a dream, a goal, a story waiting to be written on the blank canvas of existence.

While dreams and goals are vital, at times, they cast shadows of misery, overshadowing life's simple joys. We all navigate this universal challenge uniquely. My dream unfolds like a blank sheet, a pencil in hand, erasing difficulties and sketching moments of joy.

Life, a formidable challenge, etches mistakes and hardships into our story. Yet, these negatives serve as lessons, guiding me to make right choices and pursue my desires. The pencil, a symbol, eventually runs out of lead – mirroring the finite nature of our time.

In this narrative, every moment, mistake, and joy contributes to life's tale. Rather than burdening me with permanence, errors become stepping stones. Just as a pencil exhausts its lead, our time, too, is limited. This realization prompts me to embrace each moment, savor joys, and learn from challenges. Every stroke of the pencil weaves a unique and beautiful story"

All my friends say I'm ""Lazy"" and need to get a job, it does nothing but make me hate myself even more, I also have Adhd and and pretty bad social anxiety so getting a job is pretty much difficult.

And with school coming back soon next month I feel as if things are not going to get any better, I'm not really good at school because of my Adhd and depression so I'm pretty much just passing my grades, and when people find out I fail some subjects they say I'm ""stupid"" and a ""retard"" and say some even say that I'm not trying hard enough. I always ask people to do stuff for me because I'm scared I'm going to fuck it up so they usually just tell me that ""I'm never going to get anywhere in life"" because I keep asking for people to do stuff for me, I have zero confidence and hate myself so much sometimes.

I feel like I'm never going to accomplish anything, I try so hard to do new things but I keep failing, My friends barley ask me to do anything outside of school and they are always doing stuff together without me, it makes me feel so pointless to them.

18wji9x,Depression,2024-01-02,Is ending it all the only way to stop this pain?,"I made a post in r/confessions about what I did a few months ago. After I made that post I tried once again to take my life. Is there any purpose in trying? Everything seems senseless and useless. I'm too exhausted to muster the energy to accomplish anything... An overwhelming feeling of emptiness and worthlessness has taken over my entire existence. I have no value. So what if we try? I've got a lot of hopes and desires, but why bother living? It seems unlikely that we will ever cross paths. The meaning of my life is unclear. Everywhere I go, I seem to be an annoyance to everybody around me. My chest is tight and I can't breathe...Never will I forgive myself, I fear. Is there any purpose in making an effort? Never will I be anything more than a nobody. I can't get out. I feel like the whole world is pressing down on me. Nothing I do turns out well. It seems like no matter what I do, I fail. I have no idea what to do with my life and I feel completely hopeless. I have no strength left in me and need help now. That's the one thing I really, really regret. The point of living seems to be meaningless. It seems like no matter what I do, things just get worse. Even in my nightmares, it follows me. Constantly present, it torments me. What I did was horribly wrong, and I feel terrible about it. I had a profound sense of emptiness and insignificance and needed some kind of affirmation to make me feel like my life mattered. Every morning, I have to force myself out of bed.  
I despise myself and wish I didn't exist. I just don't know what the point of living is anymore. Even though I'm doing things that are meant to assist and taking medication, I still want to terminate my life. My time outside has increased as I wait for anything to happen to me. No matter how hard I try, I just can't seem to find happiness. This can't go on much longer. All of this is too much to bear at the moment. There seems to be no light at the end of the tunnel. I get this overwhelming feeling of worthlessness and despair, that my existence is meaningless and pointless. Without me, the world would be a better place. When the suffering became too much to take, I made the decision to end it all. Trying to ignore it is futile. I might as well just stop trying right now. There's no use in continuing; tomorrow will be the same whether I accomplish something or not. This way of life is untenable for me. Having one day go well and the next not at all...I find it unappealing. To put it simply, I'm exhausted. I need something to hold on to at this point if I have any hope of survival. However, I have no interest in continuing this game. There is no place for someone like me in this world.  
I just want to escape... I've done something I can't forgive. I faked a terminal illness. I was self-centered. I lied about so many things just to get attention. I feel like the world is collapsing. I can't... I want relief. I wish I could undo it. I did something I regret. I think about it before bed and when I wake up. I should feel bad since what I did was wrong. I felt hollow and needed to know I mattered. Waking up and wishing I hadn't is hard. I hate myself...I really hate myself. It's always me. This yet another time that my actions have negatively affected someone else's life. I am the problem. I think I'm bad luck...I want to die. I don't want to hurt anyone else anymore. I'm so sorry...I ended up hurting people... When I think of all those people that have died from or lost a loved one to cancer it makes me hate myself more and more. I know that I can never be someone worth caring about or someone who deserves to loved. I don't deserve it. I just want to let everything out anonymously before it's too late."

I starve myself just so I like how I look in the mirror. I was around 180 lbs from middle school all the way through high school and even into young adulthood. Now I’m at 130 lbs and still dropping. I hope everyday that something will happen to end it. Whether that’s some crazy opportunity or something to just end it all. I don’t want to be here anymore. I just don’t. I don’t see a point anymore honestly. I feel like I’m a burden to everyone, and I’m just so ready for it to be over.

18wjasr,Depression,2024-01-02,I wish I could believe,"I wish I could believe in a God, or any sort of religion. I wish I could be religious. Then all of my pain could at least be justified. Pain with reason is 100 times easier than pain without. Like what am I even here for? I see everyone else trying, working toward things, finding a grand purpose with ""God's help"" or whatever, and I am so envious of them.

Instead, I'm here, kinda just winging it. I wish I could believe that things happen for a reason. But the universe is just random chance to me. The world is cruel. The world sees so much more suffering than any goodness that could offset it. It really has made me struggle with everyday things lately, and made me slip into a sort of infinite depression.

I don't know what to do at this point. I have researched a bunch about the meaning of life previously, but now I have mostly given up.  They say create your own meaning... if only it was that easy."

I’ve been noticing that my spirals have been gradually getting worse and worse with time. When I’d finally see myself in a happy period of my life, everything eventually comes crashing down with such severity. I’ve been on medication since last year only but I’ve observed no changes despite getting the maximum dose and changing meds. Counseling, support, hotlines, they always say the same when I try making an effort to save myself. I’ve never met anyone who truly cares or understands. I’m tired of trying out different solutions and getting nowhere, I’m tired of pleading for help, I’m just tired. I can’t stop reliving my past trauma, I can’t stop thinking, it’s an endless loop that makes me want to just end it all already. 

I want to go painlessly. If I had the opportunity, I’d gladly accept it if I wasn’t such a coward. I don’t care about anything anymore, I am simply an empty shell that needs to be swept away into the depths of the ocean’s nothingness. I don’t belong here. I don’t want to exist anymore."

18wirsm,Depression,2024-01-02,I think I want to keep going. Just a little longer,"For the past two weeks I've (20NB) wanted to kill myself. Crashing my car in a ditch, taking two trash cans with me, because I fell asleep was nearly the final nail. My first thought after the car stopped moving was: 

""Oh no... What have I done...?? I'm going to kill myself.""

And I really meant it. I called my dad and him and my mom came to pick me up. While they were driving to pick me up, someone stopped. They had turned around to check on me. No one else had. They even offered to stay until my parents came. I surprised myself when I said yes.

When we got back to the house I was bitter to everyone (my younger brother of 4 years came with. I have 5 siblings total, me being the 2nd eldest) and for the first time ever reacted on my emotions without thinking about anything, before or after. (i tried to put our trash can in the truck and it fell. I kicked it and screamed, then walked away. Just before my dad joked that I should fix up the van I crashed, as it was the 3rd time I'd ""crashed"" it (swerving an opossum, deer, then this). I glared at him like I was going to kill him instead. Uncharacteristically I dont regret that...)

I stayed at my parents house that night and went to work the next day. After a day or two, I was feeling better and thinking about it less. But just now, when i was in the shower, I suddenly had the feeling to try something else. I smoke bud, but only for fun. Lately thats been different. But I remember my friend talking about a dnd character of mine and saying it would be cool to have him find weed and mellow out because of it (hes a bitter, depressed elf who came to fruition naturally in 2021 when I was in a similar place to most people here. Except, I can't see him killing himself. Maybe bc if I did I would lose all hope for myself... He's honestly my other half and the idolized incarnation of my psych) Anyway, I decided maybe I should do the same as him. For now at least. I may get addicted but at least I'm alive?"
18wiqf0,Depression,2024-01-02,Do you ever feel so disappointed with yourself that you decided not to give your body some rest because waking up feels so much more painful?,"Have you? Like have you been through an episode, perhaps a trigger so bad that you don't feel like you wanna sleep because getting yourself to wake up and get out of bed is so painful?

I've done this a couple of times, I just feel it's much easier to get up and go to work. I'd stay up through the night, sometimes just blankly staring out the window, the ceiling. Sometimes I'd binge eat and watch my comfort show, and play the heck out of some video games just so I don't fall asleep, because that moment when you open your eyes from sleeping, is so fucking dreadful to go through. I find it easier to go through the day if I just waited till the sun comes up, hit a cold shower, get something to eat and go to work.

I will be so tired and exhausted at work, but i find it easier to get through the day. The more exhausted I am, the easier it is for my mind to shut up, stop having so many thoughts and just go autopilot for 8-9 hours before I go back, probably sleep after that for 2-3 hours, wake up in the middle of the night and repeat the cycle. Sometimes i just blankly go through 3 days straight without sleeping. Tired as hell but yeah...i feel like i deserve the pain, for being such a burden to everyone.

Can anyone relate? I just wanna read some thoughts and perhaps learn some other coping ways. Thanks for reading."

18wilu4,Depression,2024-01-02,I just need advice please.,"Before I start I have no thoughts of SH I just feel like im drowning and I just don't know how to escape that. I hate my self, Im disgusting, and I think the people around me hate me as much as I hate my self. My dad was never present in my life, I'm lucky if I got a message for my birthday so I have lot of mixed emotions. Sometimes I blame him for me being the way I am and other times I crave for him to notice me. The problem is the one time a year I actually talk to him its like a chore for him, I know he doesn't care so what's point. Every time this happens it make me realize how truly unworthy I am to him. Here recently the depression and anxiety have started to come back and its causing me to stay up late and sleep all day. Every time I wake up at 1 in the afternoon I think ""damn, I'm pathetic and I am lazy sack of shit who doesn't do anything"". Then I start to think if I see myself this way I can only imagine how my family and friends must see me. They must have the same amount of hate for me that I have for myself. But none less I can't stop, for some reason all i can muster to do is stay in my room when I am awake, eat junk, play video games, or watch TV.  All I see in the mirror is a fat, lonely, ugly person . All I feel is self disgust but for some reason even if I know how to fix my problems for some reason I don't. how fucked up is that I complaining about stuff I can change but I just don't. All I need is for someone to please tell me what's wrong with me and why I am this way. I feel like every time I open up I go to far and scare people off or I putting who I'm talking to out. All I need is someone to truly understand what Im going through and I just want know I'm not alone. Thank for anyone who actual read this any opinion's are apricated on what I need to do to fix myself because I don't want to be like this forever."

18wijtx,Depression,2024-01-02,"I tried to figure out what is wrong with me and now I'm sprialing, need advice.","For the longest time I struggled. With my self image, how I felt, loneliness, making friends, finding fulfilling hobbies. 
I decided I would try to fix my self, try and look better, be more out going and try really hard to better myself. It's been years since and I have hobbies and friends and my self image isn't awful but there's something off. It doesn't feel right or true. I think I put up a facade in trying to do all this. I don't feel like I'm a true version of me. I don't feel like any of my friends are real and I don't think that if I got into a relationship right now it would be true and I'd be in love. 
I guess I'm struggling with everything because I've tried for so long and did it wrong? Or it doesn't seem right there's a pit in my stomach, full with regret and sorrow that it feels like is pulling me in. 
Mostly I feel like I'm at square 1 again. I was wondering if anyone is going through something similar or has gone through something similar with words of advice. Thank you all and stay strong."

18wi9sa,Depression,2024-01-02,I have no comfort in my life,I think that is what I finally realize. That I have no emotional comfort in my life. No one comforts me. There is nothing to sooth me when I am upset. And I am so sick of having no one in my life that has my back. If things fall apart I am fucked. That is the awful truth. At this point I am only about a month from homelessness if anything goes wrong. My two youngest sons don’t have jobs or licenses and I am left to support them. I love them so I will do it gladly. But it puts such a strain on me. To be honest I don’t know how much longer I can keep doing this. I think I may just one day wander away into the mountains and never come back.
18wi2c0,Depression,2024-01-02,I can't really describe it in a title.,"I (17m) was cheated on recently. I have had a past of struggling with depression and being completely unable to identify any emotion. I realiser I was being cheated after I saw her out of hospital. She let me know she was I'll during a hockey game, (I'm not captain just an average forward for a minor hockey team) I fought through it. Keeping myself focused on the game. I fought for the team. (we lost 7-9). I, don't like being touched, hugging or kissing or any of the sort that's more than a handshake. I just can't manage it anymore. I box myself away from everything and everyone. I don't wanna even talk to Freinds much more the a few minutes anymore. I feel constantly tired as my sleep schedule gets further and further out of sync. I just. Nothing scares me. Nothing can hurt me. I am in a cage of my own engineering. And I try to convince myself I like it, I don't like it. I want to just be free of it. But I'm constantly remind of how much of an idiot I am. How worthless I am. People at school. I developed methods in response to this to stay virtually unnoticed. Where a peer finally saw me once and exclaimed ""[name] I haven't seen you in months"" I responded with ""and you shouldn't have seen me today either"" she laughed it off and walked away. I didn't feel anything from that encounter. It's also I feel fake as well. I shift who I am to others so everyone sees what they want to. And no one sees that I'm broken and hopeless inside. Chistmas only hurt more. The more I hid away. The less I wanted to feel. Focused on a fucking game as a reason to live. Simply because I bought a tank in warthunder. (go ahead I know ridicule me for playing warthunder) 
I just. I donr feel like there is anyone. Who truely understands me. I am alone aren't I."
18wi1rb,Depression,2024-01-02,I haven’t felt genuine happiness in years,"Honestly tired of being around. It’s just too much. Every day is a reminder that I’m not good enough, I don’t think I’ll ever be. Nothing brings me joy anymore, I haven’t felt ‘good’ in years. I think I’m approaching a breaking point here soon. I just genuinely cannot keep living like this. I don’t enjoy anything. Every year it gets worse, that’s been the trend as long as I’ve known. Extrapolate that trend onto the rest of life, I don’t know how much I got left in me, man. 

Regardless of how much you try and make things better it always stays the same. There is a problem with me. Every time I express happiness it feels performative for the sake of other people. If I was always truly myself I would constantly be in a state of deep depression. Nothing had worked out for me on improving my state of mind. Working out, therapy, socialization, it all just serves as a reminder of how I don’t measure up. I haven’t felt good in years, I can’t live under this constant feeling of distress anymore. 

I don’t want to be around, I’m tired of living like this. I just want to be able to maintain a neutral emotional state but that’s impossible without drugs. I am the shell of a man, it’s hard to look in a mirror. I am disgusted with myself. I take 3-4 showers every day to try and clean off that filth but it never washes off. It seeps deep into myself, something I can never get rid of. I have no goals, I have no aspirations, I have no interest, all I want to do is just end the pain. I feel like I’m already a walking corpse. 

Does every day hurt this much for everyone else?"
18wi0bl,Depression,2024-01-02,I don’t know what to do,"If have reasons to be happy, I don’t feel them. I can repeat them in my head or break down logically why I should feel happy or somewhat satisfied but I just don’t feel it. But when I have any reason to feel sad, jealous, scared, anxious, suicidal, angry, or any bad emotion, I feel it. It hurts so much more than it should, my mind can’t put it down, and I will never ever forget it. I have had so much medical and psychiatric help in my life since I was 10, I eat healthy, I exercise very regularly, I take my meds, and I see my therapist every week. It hasn’t stopped getting worse. Every time I feel like I’m at my lowest emotionally, I end up missing how it felt once it inevitably sinks even deeper. I’ve lost so much interest in everything that used to bring me any sense of joy. I feel like I’m losing my mind. I just want it to stop. I want to feel real again."
18wi01b,Depression,2024-01-02,I'm tired," I have people, but I don't put in the work because I'm either tired or paralyzed with depression or agoraphobia. Life is overwhelming and I feel defective. The season doesn't help but I wasn't much better in the summer. I'm so tired. In my soul."
18whw90,Depression,2024-01-02,Question about random bout of true sadness compared to constant feeling of anger when depressed,"So when I’m depressed, i often am extremely angry. Whenever I have bad depressive episodes in extremely agitated, easily irritated, and feel like I want to just break everything and snap 24/7.  

I’ve been dealing with that type of depression manifestation for about 5 yrs now and before those 5 years it presented as sadness where I would just want to cry and would not feel angry like I do now. 

A few weeks ago, I had a week where I was truly sad. It felt so foreign to me. Like I haven’t been truly sad in a depressive episode for so long that I genuinely had no clue to how process those emotions. I’m just always angry all the time because it’s how my anxiety and depression combo present itself. Anger is my go to emotion, so when I was sad I didn’t understand how to react. 

Has that ever happened to anyone?"
18whw6q,Depression,2024-01-02,"After taking Sertraline for three years, I became a happy fool","I was diagnosed with severe depression in 2019. After taking Sertraline for three years, I seemed to have become a happy fool.  
Over the past few years, I have suffered from panic attacks, physical reactions, and the constant belief that I would never see the sun again tomorrow. There were many times when I wanted to end my life, but I gave myself a reason. If I couldn't find the meaning of life, I would insist on living even for friends and family.  
Yes, I am a girl who grew up in a traditional East Asian family. Since I was a child, my parents have taught me that taking care of other people’s emotions is much more important than taking care of my own. Because, for a long time, I always lived for others.  
However, such thoughts made my depression worse. I was afraid of going out to socialize. My language system became confused when talking to others, and I always blamed myself for saying the wrong thing.  
During a sleepless night, I suddenly realized that my thoughts were stupid. If I care about myself, who can respect me?  
I began to no longer be cautious about interpersonal relationships, I was free to be myself, no longer thought about the meaning of life, and no longer cared about the lives of others. I became a happy fool, but I'm glad I did."
18whif8,Depression,2024-01-02,I honestly want to hide from world,"I'm so afraid and tired. I'm not stronger than I thought. I reflect myself how fragile I am. 

I had the most terrible experiences that most people wouldn't have as a child. Even back then, I was so fragile. 

I'm afraid, guys. I honestly don't know what to do. 
I don't have degree. I'm 24 but I feel really too late. Everything I have believed has fallen apart or gone permanently."

18wh8et,Depression,2024-01-02,I don’t know what to do,"I keep asking myself if I’ll ever feel content again. It feels like no matter where I go I get really uncomfortable even if the people I’m staying with are trying to make me feel welcome. I am dropping out of college cause I just can’t do it anymore and my parents don’t want me. They think I’m a failure. 

My old group of friends and I got into a fight. They left me in a bar in a foreign country on my birthday cause they got drunk and forgot about it. This hurt my feelings and they said that I don’t drink much so it would’ve happened anyways.
I’m leaving all the new friends I just made and I’m living with one of my friends from high school but I can’t even get a job cause my car insurance is from out of state and this neighborhood is in the countryside. 

I usually skate, run, or workout a lot to feel better but lately I don’t want to do anything. I just wish I had my own place so I could ugly cry and get it all out but I’m afraid of making these people think it’s their fault so I stay quiet. 

I had an esa(emotional support animal) in college and he died and ever since then I feel like I have no purpose. I know it was probably dumb to put all my purpose into an animal but I just lived for him.

Also my final remaining grandparent is sick and I physically can’t go and see him and it hurts so bad. I just feel so helpless. I don’t want to tell the people who are caring for me cause I don’t want to bother them, they’ve already spent so much on me and I just started living here. 

I just don’t know what to do for my future. I want to work but college was just so lonely (I went to a super small cliquey all-women’s school) and I had a few friends who also left to go live with their families. I wish that my family cared for me sometimes.

Any advice or judgement even would be appreciated. I think I just needed an anonymous way to let this all out."
18wh6l4,Depression,2024-01-02,I’ve never been this lonely before and I feel like I shouldn’t,"Idk why I’m even on here just hoping to have someone to talk to I guess. I’ve never opened up to anyone and I shouldn’t feel as lonely as I do I have a loving family, some friends, and a gf but I feel like besides my parents I’m just an option to everyone. I can be around a group of friends or even my gf and I still feel lonely. I stay as positive as I can and I put everyone before myself and I feel like I’m destroying myself by keeping all my emotions to myself. If anyone reads this and needs a friend I’m always here for you, love everyone."
18wh2z6,Depression,2024-01-02,So tired of this,"Background: 
I have been depressed on some level for my entire life. I have CPTSD and ADHD, and have been in and out of therapy since my teens (now late 30s) and currently trying EMDR. A couple of months ago I experienced a major betrayal by my previous therapist who turned out to be unethical, and I’m still reeling from it. 

And now a rant: 
I try so hard, and many times I really do pull myself out of the darkness and find a lust for life. But it’s always fleeting. The depression is always looming in the background getting ready to suck me back into its bottomless depths. The ups and downs are so so tiring. I know healing is not linear, but damn. I am on a rollercoaster and I just want to get off. ITS SO HARD BEING A PERSON. It’s so hard being alive. As I approach my 40s I fear that this is it. This is as good as it gets. And that scares the crap out of me. 

I’ve done all of the things. I see a holistic psychiatric nurse who is lovely. She not only prescribes my meds but gave me a lot of information on the benefits of light therapy and weighted blankets etc which I appreciate. I’ve seen multiple therapists for basic talk therapy (not very helpful), a trauma informed art therapist (who ended up traumatizing me further LOL) and currently working with a therapist who does EMDR and IFS. I take my meds and vitamins. I journal. I make art. I go to my therapy sessions. I do all of the things… but I do them amidst the ever present doom and gloom. Is this just my life? 

I’m so tired of being alive but I don’t want to die. I can’t leave my sister behind. I truly believe if I didn’t have her I’d have been gone a while now. I just can’t stand being a person. It’s so damn hard."
18wh01i,Depression,2024-01-02,Seasonal depression caught up to me. All because my mom threw out cookies I made.,"Spent an hour on these mother fuckin cookies a little over a week ago and was enjoying them slowly. Had been excited to make them, even (it's been a while since I've been excited over my hobbies.)

Last couple of days I've lost my appetite and hadn't had them but tonight I said I'll eat a few to try and cheer myself up. Went to grab one and they're gone. My mom came over earlier and had helped clean out the fridge from Christmas cooking that didn't get eaten.. did not even ask me about anything (I cook for myself and my elderly father) and my cookies were a casualty. She meant well, at least. 

But I broke down over this. Feel so fucking stupid crying over cookies but it feels like a slap in the face and I was already pitying myself for Christmas and New Year's Day. 

My Reddit account has become nothing but venting. Thanks for coming to my Dep talk."
18wgz54,Depression,2024-01-02,Why is it so hard to tell your partner the issues that are happening in the relationship?,I was in a relationship not too long ago we already broke up but during the relationship I feel like it was my fault since like when whenever I was with my boyfriend he always put his head down and when like even tried touching his shoulder he brushed my hand off or tried talking to him he just ignored me then he just started ignoring me completely and honestly I got jealous because he was always seemed so happy with his friends and then I just started hating myself since I couldn't make him smile when he broke up with me he told it was because I was ignoring him and that just made me cut my wrists I loved him alot but when that happend I didn't know what to do so I just started pushing away everyone ignoring him too and just starving myself I never told him because I felt like a burden I wish I speaked out I still miss him.
18wgwuw,Depression,2024-01-02,I am completely drawn. No energy at all,"I don’t even know how to start explaining how difficult my life with depression and anxiety is. I’m currently in a depressive episode due to a mean person Who did me really wrong. I feel that I hate everyone and can’t deal with anyone.. I feel constant shame with any interaction, doesn’t matter if I really did something shameful or not. I feel like I’m in a very dark place, hopeless and pointless. I am hating myself and everyone else most of the time. Just tired of everyone and everything. Tired of life."

I realize all this hard work just to keep myself alive?? Why can't I just be normal. I hate being alive.

I'm only alive for my siblings but after seeing a friend committed last year and seeing how life is still going on. 

I honestly see no point in trying, just float and hopefully one day I will get dragged down too."

I have struggled with drinking more than ever and just seemed to be going down a brighter path. I went out with friends on NYE and got blacked out shit faced, showing up to my in-laws house by around 10pm. I had no intention of becoming that way. It seems like every time I drink it just end up getting too far gone. I can’t begin to believe that my life is heading down this path and I just really hate who I am right now. My wife and children do not deserve this from me. And I just feel so helpless. I feel nothing will ever fix me. I don’t want them to grow up in my image. I want to be better for them. I’m just so tired of being me."

i had this debate in my head yesterday if i should or shouldn’t, but i know i never will because i’m too scared. i always think of doing it, and always have the urge to do it. i make up scenarios of doing it, it’s always in my head. but i’ll never do it now because i’m too scared, but i’m scared one day the thought will consume me so much that i won’t be scared anymore."

My fiancé &amp; I cried in each other’s arms and I said out loud that I have no other choice but to push through this - for me, for us &amp; for the future. I just can’t keep doing this. This night is my wake up call. 

Tomorrow I will reach out to my psychiatrist for a medication adjustment because the lamitrogine I’m on right now isn’t working. I also will connect with my therapist for a sooner appointment.

Any words if encouragement for me or anyone in this community are welcomed."
18wgpbu,Depression,2024-01-02,Suicidal for officially two years and the NY has been tough...,"I \[27M\] had a major suicidal depressive episode due to abuse from a professor in grad school, and although I got better, I feel myself falling back into it in the NY. Could be because of the celebrating an everyone asking how it feels to be in a new year, but last year was tough. I got my degree in the main early last year, and after some feeling of relief from the situation, I developed a panic disorder from it and almost couldn't leave my apartment. Additionally, my partner started to drift away and although we are still together, I am worried about the future. I got a job, but with a very scary boss who is unhappy with everything (from everyone, not just me) and I feel like a failure. I went on instagram and I see people that look so much happier, financially stable, and a reputable career. I lost most of my 20s due to the pandemic, and I just feel trapped still. My therapist also upped their price astronomically this year and my parents, who are assisting in the phyc care, don't want to pay more. Suffice to say, I am not feeling great about 2024. "
18wgp6g,Depression,2024-01-02,Catching feelings for one of my best friends and its killing me,"This is gonna be kind of long but I’d love some input on this situation.

Theres a girl in my life who I met at school who I’ll call Jessica. We became good friends and I introduced her to my friends group. I have never tried to do anything sexual or flirty with her, although she has given me a quick peck once at a party. She has also told me I am hot drunk but I don’t know if it was truthful.

Over the past few months I grew really close with Jessica and starting growing feelings for her. We talk about our day every day, text each other, play games, etc. She is very attentive, always remembering things I say even if its just once, and shows interest in my life and the things I care about.

Heres where we get to the bad part. Jessica is for everyone except me. She is extremely flirty/touchy with my friends and it makes me very uncomfortable. She has made out with three of my friends drunk, one of them even confessing his feelings for her and having his first kiss taken after, but she continues to say she has no interest in him romantically. She likes the attention and its awful.

Despite this, she keeps leading him on holding his hand/being touchy with him when shes drunk and it keeps hurting him. I tell her she needs to stop this repeatedly and she hasnt yet.

I feel so awful. I wish I didn’t form these feelings for her when I know the things she does. Shes a good friend but I am afraid to lose her. I feel like self conscious knowing that she is willing to be extremely flirty/touchy with my friends and shows no interest in me in that regard. It makes me question if I am really that unappealing. I don’t have a lot of experience with women and it feels great to talk to her but I am hurting."

I have pmdd as well and it brings on suicidal thoughts very strong at least once a month. I’ve become such a pessimist, just waiting for the next bad thing to happen. If it weren’t for my kids, I don’t think I’d be here. I say it all the time but I’m just so incredibly sick of this. Yes I know ut will get better, but I also know it will be bad again because that’s how it is. How can I get better and stay better? I’m on meds, I exercise, i eat healthy."
18wgng8,Depression,2024-01-02,Venting it all out!!,"Hey,The weather's foggy here reminding me of my life as I look out of the window.I don't think anyone is going to read it but if you do,You have my thanks.

I am a boy of 18,from a small city who used to have really big dreams as a kid and up until 15 years of age.I have come to a bigger city for University entrance preparation.Currently I don't feel much,not happy not sad just sometimes cry out of frustration.I wasn't always like this,even when I had TB,got bullied on a daily basis,got eye floaters for life etc.I wanted to fight,used to think a story without setbacks is just not worth anything.Now I know there are people that are in much worse position than I am and I try to think it this way but I fail to do so.

I had never been a completely healthy kid,somehow I was always sick but when I got 13 years old,I felt anxiety and other set of varied emotions for the first time.I started forgetting things-from basic mathematical calculations to the spellings,even the faces of my dear ones,I had an exceptional memory before and Since I used to be too much sensitive as a kid,so never told anything about it to anyone.Suppressed the emotions and continued to work on the problems.I started waking up at 2-3am just to read the dictionary,just to do the basic calculations.Days passed the problem just increased,so I had to tell my mother about it.Now ,I come from a lower middle class family so,medical expenses are just too much for us.She thought it was a black magic or something and took me to a Pundit ji.Even though it never got cured,I started to worry about it less.

Day by Day,my cognitive abilities started to decrease and during 15,my eye floaters seemed to increase too and there was this covid too.Everything felt like against me,started developing pessimistic thoughts during those years.The situation continued to get worse both financially and mentally but I never lost hope other than a few instances.During my 16th birthday,I first thought about Suicide but the visuals of my mother and sister crying would stop me.During that my nerves and body started to give up.I was fatigued,had bad pains and brain fog etc.

I got my B12 and Vit D checked,It was really low and I also got to know they cause these issues.But still doctor said eat healthy food,there's no need for injections.My mother believed him and forwarding to last year,I completed my High School with no motivation.I realised that my abilities have declined and there's no way to get those back.Thats why I thought of getting into the Armed Forces after getting LASIK surgery.Hence I gave NDA Exam,And as it turns out,I am colorblind.
colorblind.Now after another plan failed,I came to a bigger city and started preparing for Engineering exam.Initially,I thought it's going to be fine but just after a month,I lost my spectacular visualisation skill.Went to a psychologist of the coaching telling her this,and the losing of emotions part and her words were-""Focus on being Logical,Why do you want to get emotional during preparation""

I did,I focused on the logical part.I started studying for Day and night,but everything surely just ended up in my brain fog but I still tried.Now I don't remember anything about the last 17 years,It feels like a black canvas with some white spots.

Now a week ago,I got my Blood Tested.Guess what,I still have VitaminB12 and D deficiency along with some thyroid issue and some other problems.

Now,my cognitive skills have declined to such a level,If I try to get back-I am never going to be.
At the moment,Suicide seems the most logical path-I should take.Its not like I don't want to fight,but a fight when your own body and fate doesn't give you a chance to get up,I am not sure about that.
And Sorry for your time.Just wanted to vent it all out.

I WISH,NO ONE SHOULD GO THROUGH ANYTHING LIKE THIS."

18wgld0,Depression,2024-01-02,This Is My First Time Opening Up Like This,"So, I’m a 32 year old guy who has had (I think) moderate to severe depression going back to my early teenage years. The severity of it sort of waxes and wanes but it’s always been there to some degree. I attempted to take my life in dramatic fashion when I was 19, which was followed by a short period of therapy that lasted maybe 6 months. In the time between then and now, I’ve never made a serious attempt to tackle this problem, which has lead to me staying single the entire time with very few close friends. It’s been intensely lonely, which lead me to develop a serious drinking habit that started about 3 years ago. I’m two days sober and I’ve spent most of that time at my best friends’ house and I’ve started telling him some of the things I’ve kept inside for over a decade. I’ve only begun to scratch the surface but it was a big leap for me and I could feel these flood gates start to open. I’m going to look into seeing a therapist and finally try to get my life and head figured out. I’m not really sure what I’m looking for by posting this, and I don’t expect anyone to reply, but I would love to talk to anyone who has the time and doesn’t mind."
18wgigb,Depression,2024-01-02,Depression relapse?,"So I haven't ever been on reddit before and I don't usually write about my feelings so I'm sorry if this is messy. 

I'm also 17 so I can't tell if I'm being dramatic or whether or not I am going back into my depression from before.

In November I had a breakup with my ex and I thought that my time with her was good and that I was happy but my family and friends pointed out that key parts of the relationship were actually toxic. With a fresh perspective on the relationship I believe that my depression never actually ended and I was neglecting my own feelings so that I wouldn't ruin her feelings.

I had issues with suicide before I met her due to issues with how I was treated and when I met her I tried to ignore these feelings as she confessed she had problems with suicide and that she had actually cut herself so I felt as though my problems weren't dramatic enough to be acknowledged. I assumed that my problems clearly weren't that bad and that I was being dramatic and wasn't being ""a man"" so I never expressed my feelings and now that she's gone I have been able to express my emotions to people .

Recently I've been unable to sleep because of suicidal thoughts, feeling of loneliness even around friends and family. I also have issues with self esteem due to something my ex said as we broke up but she said we could try again but after a week I realised I didn't want to be with her anymore I just liked the feeling of being important to someone so when my best friend said she had feelings for me and I realised that I had developed feelings for her throughout our 8 year friendship. Once I confessed this to my ex she said I clearly never loved her and everytime I think about her I think about how I had to stop her from cutting herself and those feelings of not being enough for someone to stay for I feel even more hurt than I did during the initial bit of the breakup. 

I feel like this is making what I think is depression worse and I am struggling to deal with being alone. The way things are going I could end up dating my best friend but I still feel unsatisfied in my life, my hobbies are boring me I don't know why I just never feel like I enjoy anything anymore. 

I'm sorry for writing so much I just needed to express my feelings somewhere as bottling them up is clearly making things worse and I talk about them with family I just don't have anyone at night when I'm struggling to sleep.

Thank you if you did read this I just don't know what I'm feeling right now."
18wgfcy,Depression,2024-01-02,Good to Bad,"Yesterday I had an amazing day. I woke up fresh, happy, motivated. It was the first good day I've had in a while. But by the end of the day I could feel it all starting to slip away. I don't know how to explain. It felt like it was slowing fading away and it was just out of grasp. I tried to slavage it but I just couldn't. 

Today, was absolute trash. I'm lazy, unmotivated, hopeless, sad. I don't wanna do anything or be around anyone. And it sucks even more knowing that it could be better but I have no control over it."
18wgbpy,Depression,2024-01-02,How can I explain to my boyfriend what depression is like?,"My boyfriend is a very logical person. For example when I’m upset it’s often why are you upset instead of compassion. Not that he’s mean or anything, he just genuinely can’t understand. Sometimes I’ll get these random waves of deep sadness where I physically feel it and I don’t know what to do. I just cry uncontrollably and feel this really intense horrible feeling and I feel almost panicked because it’s so intense and I can’t relieve it. I’d relate it to an intense physical where the height of the pain never dulls. My boyfriend doesn’t understand why I feel so sad over nothing specific and nothing provoking it. He doesn’t get how I have a sad feeling looming over me all day everyday even when I’m in better moods. I’ve been depressed for years and it’s morphed into a new form than in the past. I don’t feel as hopeless as much as I just feel so done and exhausted. Google does a terrible job of explaining deep depression and what it’s like mentally and chemically to explain to my boyfriend it’s like a disease and not something brought on by an event or something specific. I want to almost give him Ana analogy or just some sort of explanation of what it’s like so he can understand a little better. It’s just hard cause he’s not an emotional thinker, he’s an intellectual thinker and logically driven. And he’s not very empathetic. He’s so sweet and wants to understand so bad he just doesn’t have those qualities naturally so I want some help on how to help me help him understand. Cause I need more support and I think that would come from a better understanding and something that would help him put himself in my shoes or anyone’s shoes with depression. He just seriously doesn’t get it. When I get that upset he gets nervous cause he doesn’t get it and just says “please stop crying” “why are you crying” and all his compassion goes out the window because it’s almost so overwhelming to him because it’s confusing. I’d say it’s like how you see someone laughing maniacally when doing something terrible, how it gives you that weird uncomfortable feeling you can’t explain. Anything would help"
18wfvnr,Depression,2024-01-02,Hi. Can I talk to someone?,I’m feeling especially bad today. Some things happened and I can’t get to get them out of my head. I don’t have no one to talk to.
18wfrw4,Depression,2024-01-02,Well here I go again.,"I have always wondered how someone could commit suicide after a false accusation. Now I am on the end of it... I kind of get it.

2023 was my year. Well that's what I thought atleast. I moved into a bigger apartment. I got a girlfriend. She was sweet and I still see her as being sweet at times. Well that has changed in my minds eye now.

Everything was great with her until the fights started. They started off minor but around the 6 month mark I couldn't stand it and I ended it with her.

Recently, I started having panic attacks over the past few days. I can't sleep and I don't have an appetite. I keep on crying for no known reason.

I realised a lot was on my mind and I needed to get some closure.
I wrote a letter to her and I sent it and she accepted and all seemed okay.
I advised her that I don't want to be in a relationship but I would love to be part of her life still and she seemed okay.  However she said she has a partner and this will only be in contact every other moment in life. Which I believe is fair.

Then I said something to a comment she made that I do not believe to the full story and I rebuttled. Stating there are always 2 sides to a story. At the end of the relationship we both had emotional trauma that we haven't resolved. For me I didn't like that she would gaslight me and I would have to walk on eggshells. For her apparently I caused her to have a mental breakdown.

It ended up where we had a call and she called me an emotional abuser stating she was this saint but in reality we both caused harm.

She claimed I was this monster. We have since cut contact. Which is a good thing. Even through this I told her I would love to be friends but she sees me as this monster... I will never be able to change her mind.

I won't contact her again but now the anxiety is even higher. I haven't slept in about 3 days now and the conversation last night didn't help.

I went through our old messages and I just don't see signs of me being an emotional abuser.

I understand that I probably could be more open with her in the relationship as that was her chief complaint but I was never abusive to her. I have seen abuse with my Mom and Dad which is totally different to this.

I understand there are 2 sides to a story. So for me it has forced me to take a major step back and think about my actions. She doesn't seem to care and believes she has no fault in it.

I just don't like being called an abuser... I don't believe I am one and I have seen stuff like this ruin people's lives. Which my anxiety is at a major high.

It has caused me anxiety to even think about dating someone else because I am petrified of being an actual abuser. It is not something I want on my rap sheet.

Now my mind has been allowing thoughts of suicide in again. I used to struggle with it and I had worked hard to not allow it to happen.
I know my trigger is feeling trapped and I do feel trapped in life at the moment. My career has stagnated. There are no romantic partners on the future. I can't enjoy what used to give me joy.

I am tired. I am tired of pretending that I have meaning and I am tired of living. The thought of another year on this earth gives me anxiety. I can't give up though. I have 2 cats to look after and the thought of abandoning them causes me anxiety.

Right now I am only holding on for others and not myself. I am in limbo, waiting to be killed by a freak of nature.

I did reach out to a friend who I used to date as well. We remained friends after the break up and she advised me that I am not an emotional abuser and my ex is a manipulator. But how can I be sure? How can I know I am not this monster that needs to be put down. Most people in my life tells me I am a decent person but in my brain I feel like this monster.

I am sure she said these things because she knows it would get in my head. I am just going to try and be kind where I can but now I am observing every action I do to ensure I don't hurt someone else.

I am hollow. A vessel waiting for something to fill it. A vessel that has tried to fill himself... but that doesn't seem to work."

18wfn3e,Depression,2024-01-02,Constantly afraid my (28f) whole will crumble around me,"I’ve been clinically depressed since 13 years old and I always carried the weight of not knowing if I was good enough to be married, have a good job, etc.

I’m now married for over a year to great guy. We have problems at times but we always see through them. We own a house and have 2 lovely cars together.

Life was hard in 2023 - I lost two jobs and ended up with a great job with awesome potential to advance and make a good salary.

I am constantly afraid that now that I have the life I’ve been wanting. I’m afraid of financial woes, relationship issues, gaining weight, and being average at my job.

Lately I can’t seem to let the weight of this off of my shoulders. I’ll be in debt forever. I always scared my husband will have bad days and I won’t know how to help. I’m scared of death and living all at once.

I’m so tired of trying and trying. I need to keep pushing or else it feels like I could lose everything."
18wfhv1,Depression,2024-01-02,I feel stuck,"I feel like i’m stuck somewhere being alone depressed. 

I dreamed about a place where I was. It was my closet room in my previous apartment, and I was buried in a pile of clothes in the corner. 

And I said, “mom I tried my best but I couldn’t make it sorry” then just felt like infinitely got stuck in there. No end no change. Literal Eternity. 

At that time I didn’t have loneliness but I had a sense of sadness and loss like an abandoned slave with nowhere to go. 

But I couldn’t cry. 

Just tears doesn’t come out because there is another undescribable mood that makes you more miserable.


Have any of you gotten this feeling?"

18wfgll,Depression,2024-01-02,I was doing so well,"Without fail a bought of high anxiety leads to a low depressive state. Every single time. It’s just terrible that this is what I go through. I used to have this under some kind of control but I’m losing my grip on it. I hate it. Beyond hate this feeling. Still feeling the anxiety in the pit of my stomach and the back of my brain. I swear this is my coping mechanism for anxiety. It’s an awful combination. The only solace that I have is I get worn out by it so much that I’ll usually just pass out. Then I’m mostly fine the next morning. Some days I’m not though and I’m afraid this one is going to linger though. Maybe it should, after all I probably deserve to feel like this for a while. Maybe I mis-titled. I wasn’t doing well I’m never well. I just haven’t been this bad for a while. A slow spiraling descent the entire month."
18wfd17,Depression,2024-01-02,why do I feel like im faking my issues for attention,I’ve always told myself that my issues are trivial compared to what others have to go to and that I’m just faking for some sick form of attention and pity. I’ve struggled with self destructive behavior in the past (it’s been quite a while though) and even at that time I would tell myself the exact same thing. I don’t know what this says about me. I’m horrified of tthe possibility that it could be true and I really am just a bad person seeking attention. Has anybody else gone through this/knows what causes it?
18wfbtr,Depression,2024-01-02,Fuck,"Just went through a divorce last thing, the ex said to me was it was all my fault. I am a good man but was a bad husband. We went through a miscarriage years ago when we first were married and she cheated on me multiple times. I chalked it up to her being not in her right mind, and could not bring myself to break up with her in the fear she would hurt herself. It broke me, spent the next years covering my pain with heavy drinking and pot use. We moved out of state to try and start a new life and it did nothing for me but make the depression worse. I have had depression since before I was married or dating, and used pot and alcohol then to cover it. In the past 5 months I have quit  drinking two different times and quit smoking once  for my mental health, and grown greatly in my control. Still on some days after drinking the sadness is unbearable, so I’m on another sober kick as of yesterday. Not sure for how long this time. I’m in therapy as well, I just don’t think any of this is helping. People from all walks of life keep telling my time heals all. And truly and trying my best to give it the time, just so lonely and sad every day."
18wfak4,Depression,2024-01-02,Want more people to suffer since I’m miserable and grief stricken,"My brother died almost a full year ago and the more time marches on and we celebrate the holidays and I see everyone I know living their fucking happy “best lives” the more I want them to suffer some egregious fate. I hate them. I hate how everyone has a partner, kids, friends, and goes to all of these events and parties and I’m stuck where I’m at with my social and mental problems wishing my brother was still alive and I didn’t have to deal with the trauma of seeing his lifeless corpse and trying to revive it reappear in my mind and haunt me everyday. 
Fuck everyone.
I’m grateful for what I have and I know things could be a lot fucking worse, but I want people to suffer and go through something I did so they can get snapped out of their cozy bubbles and see things for how they are, it’s like reality doesn’t apply to them somehow. Like, how is that fair?
I’m venting, I know people have it a lot worse in this world. But fuck I’m so goddamn frustrated and sad all of the time. I’m stuck and don’t have faith that things will work out."
18wf70o,Depression,2024-01-02,I hate myself and I am just done with life,I just can't anymore I hate everything about myself and I have no motivation to do anything at this point. I barely have any motivation to study or work hard in school and I barely have any interest in all the things I liked to do. I wish I could just enjoy things and enjoy life but instead I sit around all day doing nothing. I am not eating or drinking enough and I am just unhealthy overall. All of my 'friends' hate me and constantly make fun off me. It is far from the usual joking around that most friends do it is to the point where I am the butt of every single joke and they make fun off me for things that they know I am insecure about and don't want mentioned. I am in a discord server with them and there have been times where I felt like they didn't want me so I left a few times but whenever I do that all they do is call me dramatic and say I want attention meanwhile they are the ones who seem like they didn't want me there anyway. They only ever care how I feel when I say anything suicidal and then that is when they act like they care probably just cause they feel obligated. Just now we were playing a game together and I left cause the way I was playing annoyed them. I stayed in the in game voice party though and one of them asked the others why I left and someone said because I wanted to be dramatic and want attention so I just left the voice channel completely. I don't get why I have to be like this and why I have to be such an annoying dumb person who everyone hates including myself. I just want to live a normal life but instead I am just a pathetic failure.

18wezi4,Depression,2024-01-02,"""just wake up tomorrow and forget all about your problems"", ""just push through, you are a man""","I opened up twice in my life regarding my problems to people that are very close to me. And both times i received the wrong answer. This has lead to me feeling like i cannot be helped. Maybe i am just past fixing. I am 19 at the moment, while everyone was celebrating enterint 2024. I feel nothing more than to die, honestly i don't think i'll make it past this year. If i do it is a fucking miracle.

At this point i am so overwhelmed by everything that i cannot move forward. Not even sure if i am depressed, i did not visit a therapist or doctor to actually get diagnosed. Just been self-hating, self-sabotaging and overall incredibly sad at myself for some years now. Fairly recently been isolating myself from others and thinking about ways to kill myself... 

Maybe i am doing something wrong, maybe i am just meant to live a short life. But i look at all my other peers and see how successful they are. How well they are pushing through, how easily some of them are succeeding. And i just feel bad, yeah i know that anyone can fake that. Hell, i myself do it pretty well i think. But even so, others can see my flaws. In my mindset, in my schedule, in my results. It all shows. 

I have failed my parents as a son, i have failed my brother as a brother, i have failed my friends as a friend, and i have failed society as a human. I am beyond broken, and i don't know how to fix myself.

I am considering visiting a therapist. But after my other failed attempts at opening up, i closed myself off completely. I am most likely not going to go to a therapist. And if i don't, it is entirely my fault. But i am wondering, even if i did not give a backstory or anything. Am i really worth it? Is it really worth it for me to live? What if i just make myself worse off. Is it not better for everyone if i just die and stop disappointing people?"
18wes72,Depression,2024-01-02,Being a kind person is so painful,"I know what it feels like to be alone. I have seen the worst of many things in my life. Therefore I do everything to prevent the people in my life from feeling what I have felt.

This is a double-edged sword, though. It seems as if the effort I give to others is a sign that I am weak and they can walk on me. Why is it so difficult for people to be appreciative of kindness and not try to milk every last drop of a person who is there for them?

It’s difficult because I can’t change who I am as a person. I live to help others and to be kind, but people lie, people use trickery, people talk about you behind your back. Boundaries can only get you so far. It is a burden I always carry. For what? For being there for people whoo needed someone I get punished? I don’t understand and never will."

It started off with crying then progressed as I got older, I would have extreme panic attacks, crying, shaking, jumping, kicking, slamming things and screaming. The worst part is it would only happen at night, when I go to bed, I dont have anything to think about, so it basically starts off like this, I go to bed, and I start thinking and thinking, pushing the thoughts further and further until my arms start to grasp on the bed sheets and shake. Last time it happened I was in the hotel with my mother, we were in our home country, it happened out of no where, I shook my hands around and layed still, then I tensed up fully and started screaming and crying in my moms arms. EVERY NIGHT I go through this terror. I started putting my iPad on my bed, i would watch something to not think about dying. My mother says it’s extremely unusual for a person of my age to have these death panic attacks. I don’t understand death, at all. I dont understand why I’m so afraid. I feel ashamed knowing I cry myself to sleep every night because of how afraid I am, I feel like a baby. I have been thinking about asking my mom to get help. I’m underage and I’ll need permission from my parents to get therapy. My mom said something awful to me like: „do you really want to get therapy? You know they will note that in all your personal informations and people will know, what will they think of you? They’ll think you’re some mentally deranged psycho“
